However, there is a knowledge gap regarding how increasing saline stress affects microbial biological interactions. We applied the combination of a probabilistic method for estimating significant co-occurrences/exclusions and a conceptual framework for filtering out associations potentially linked to environmental and/or spatial factors, in a series of connected ephemeral (hyper) saline lakes. We carried out a network analysis over the full aquatic microbiome-bacteria, eukarya, and archaea-under severe salinity fluctuations. Most of the observed co-occurrences/exclusions were potentially explained by environmental niche and/or dispersal limitation. Co-occurrences assigned to potential biological interactions remained stable, suggesting that the salt gradient was not promoting interspecific facilitation processes. Conversely, co-exclusions assigned to potential biological interactions decreased along the gradient both in number and network complexity, pointing to a decrease of interspecies competition as salinity increased. Overall, higher saline stress reduced microbial co-exclusions while co-occurrences remained stable suggesting decreasing competition coupled with lack of stress-gradient promoted facilitation in the microbiome of ephemeral saline lakes.",ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We are thankful to Xavier Triadó‐Margarit for field and lab assistance.

To determine whether the aboveground vegetation and soil physicochemical properties were the main determinant of beta-diversity and biological interaction of soil microbial community, we sampled soils from the temperate coniferous forest and grassland. Clustering of operational taxonomic units was conducted using 16S rRNA gene. We found that the microbial composition of the rhizospheres, in which root exudates influence the microbial environment, show lower alpha-diversity than that of nonroot soils. The nonsignificant rhizosphere effect suggested other undetermined factors or stochastic processes accounted for microbial diversity in the rhizosphere. More significant microbe-microbe interactions were observed in forest and rhizosphere soils relative to the grassland soils. The elevated number of positive correlations for relative abundances in forest soil implied beneficial associations being common among bacteria, in particular within the rhizosphere environment. The particular soil properties generated by root exudates also alter the physicochemical properties of soil such as K and pH value, and might in turn favor the adoption of teamwork-cooperation strategies for microbe-microbe interactions, represented as large clusters of positive associations among bacterial taxa. Specific biological interactions differentiated the microbiomes within forest soils. Thus, the environmental selection pressure of aboveground vegetation accounts for differences between soil microbiomes while biotic factors are responsible for fine-scale differences of the microbial community in forest soils.","This research was financially supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities to SHW and supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (MOST 105-2628-B-003-001-MY3 and MOST 105-2628-B-003-002-MY3) to PCL.

We attempt to discuss spatial scale patterns (macro-, meso- and microscale) according to their degree of importance in structuring sandy-beach nematode assemblages. This review will provide a substantial background on current knowledge of sandy-beach nematodes, and can be used as a starting point to delineate further investigations in this field. Over decades, sandy beaches have been the scene of studies focusing on community and population ecology, both related to morphodynamic models. The combination of physical factors (e.g. grain size, tidal exposure) and biological interactions (e.g. trophic relationships) is responsible for the spatial distribution of nematodes. In other words, the physical factors are more important in structuring nematodes communities over large scale of distribution while biological interactions are largely important in finer-scale distributions. It has been accepted that biological interactions are assumed to be of minor importance because physical factors overshadow the biological interactions in sandy beach sediments; however, the most recent results from in-situ and ex-situ experimental investigations on behavior and biological factors on a microscale have shown promise for understanding the mechanisms underlying larger-scale patterns and processes. Besides nematodes are very promising organisms used to understand the effects of pollution and climate changes although these subjects are less studied in sandy beaches than distribution patterns.","Renata Alves and Alex Silva are acknowledged for their help with GIS Mapping Software and the map quality, respectively.

Ecological theory states that, as diversity grows and ecological niches are filled, the strengthening of biological interactions imposes limits on diversity6,7. However, the extent to which biological interactions have constrained the growth of diversity over evolutionary time remains an open question1–5,8–11. Here we present a regional diversification model that reproduces the main Phanerozoic eon trends in the global diversity of marine invertebrates after imposing mass extinctions. We find that the dynamics of global diversity are best described by a diversification model that operates widely within the exponential growth regime of a logistic function. A spatially resolved analysis of the ratio of diversity to carrying capacity reveals that less than 2% of the global flooded continental area throughout the Phanerozoic exhibits diversity levels approaching ecological saturation. We attribute the overall increase in global diversity during the Late Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras to the development of diversity hotspots under prolonged conditions of Earth system stability and maximum continental fragmentation. We call this the ‘diversity hotspots hypothesis’, which we propose as a non-mutually exclusive alternative to the hypothesis that the Mesozoic marine revolution led this macroevolutionary trend12,13.","This work was funded by research grant CGL2017-91489-EXP from the Spanish government.

However, few studies have explored whether cross-community interactions are consistent or non-stationary across environmental gradients. Using the relative abundance of birds, aquatic macroinvertebrates and plants, we examined how cross-community congruence varied between short and long-hydroperiod prairie pothole wetlands in southern Alberta. These wetlands are structured by their hydroperiod: the length of time that ponded water is present in the wetland. We compared the strength of cross-community congruence and the strength of congruence between each horizontal community and wetland hydroperiod in wetlands that typically contain ponded water throughout the year to wetlands that dry up every summer. The strength of cross-community relationships was similar between more permanent and more ephemeral wetland classes, suggesting that biological interactions have a near equivalent role in shaping community composition, regardless of hydroperiod. However, because cross-community congruence, measured as the Procrustes pseudo-R value, was, on average, 77% ± SE 12% greater than that between each horizontal community and measures of wetland hydroperiod, we concluded that community structure is not shaped by hydroperiod alone. We attribute the observed cross-community congruence to (1) plants and aquatic macroinvertebrates influence birds through habitat and food provisioning, and (2) birds influence plants and aquatic macroinvertebrates by dispersing their propagules.","Funding for this research was supplied by Alberta Innovates and the Ontario Trillium Scholarship.

Several hypotheses tested patterns of biotic interactions’ intensity along latitude. Negative interactions (i.e. competition and predation) are expected to be among the processes that produce checkerboard distribution of species. However, no relationship between checkerboardness and latitude has been uncovered. We tested Odonata assemblages worldwide for segregation patterns using a faunistic dataset (395 species arranged in 386 natural communities) spanning a wide latitudinal range (87°). We used co-occurrence analyses (C-score index and Standardized Effect Size) as an estimate of checkerboardness then correlated the occurrence of segregation to latitude. Odonata followed the Latitudinal Diversity Gradient at the regional scale (i.e. country scale) within our analyzed assemblages spanning, whereas local richness (i.e. community scale) did not follow the same pattern. Odonata assemblages structured with segregation are more common going from high to low latitudes, and local species richness have no effect on the pattern. We summarized hypotheses on how biotic interactions or ecological and historical processes can influence the spatial patterns in the checkerboards of assemblages and presented promising ways to help to gain a better mechanistic understanding of the drivers of the Latitudinal Diversity Gradient.","We would like to thank all the people who made available their data on Odonata distribution.

It relies on the enhancement of biodiversity and related ecosystem services to support agricultural production. It is dependent on biological interactions for the design and management of agricultural systems in agricultural landscapes.ObjectivesWe review the role of landscape ecology to understand and promote biodiversity, pest regulation and crop pollination for the designing of “agroecology landscapes”. We illustrate the use of landscape ecological methods for supporting agroforestry systems as an example of agroecological development, and we propose pathways to implement agroecology at landscape scale.MethodsThe state of the art of how landscape ecology contributes to agroecology development is summarized based on a literature review.ResultsAgroecology requires thinking beyond the field scale to consider the positioning, quality and connectivity of fields and semi-natural habitats at larger spatial scales. The spatial and temporal organisation of semi-natural elements and the crop mosaic interact. Understanding this interaction is the pre-requisite for promoting patterns and mechanisms that foster biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. Promoting agroecological practices beyond individual farm borders can be rooted in a bottom-up approach from agroecological lighthouse farms to farm networks to amplify agroecology adoption at the landscape scale.ConclusionsAchieving agricultural landscapes composed of fields and farms following agroecological management requires understanding of biodiversity patterns, biological interactions and mechanisms that determine and boost ecosystem functioning to improve services at landscape scale, involving farmers in a bottom-up and context-specific approach.","Part of this research was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grants CRSII5_183493 “What is sustainable intensification” and 20BD21_184133 “Scenarios for Agricultural Landscapes’ Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services”), the LTSER Zone Atelier Armorique and the PREPARE and SEBIOPAG-STAR projects funded by the French Office for Biodiversity OFB and Inrae.

In addition, parasitism may also play an important role in predator-prey interaction by infecting one or both partners involved in the biological interaction. In this study, parasite mediation in predator-prey interactions of planktonic protists was addressed using model organisms commonly observed in temperate coastal environments, namely, a phototrophic dinoflagellate Akashiwo sanguinea as a potential host and prey, a heterotrophic dinoflagellate predator Luciella masanensis, and a dinoflagellates-infecting parasitoid Parvilucifera infectans. Parasite mediation permitted L. masanensis to exploit the prey A. sanguinea that the predator was otherwise unable to use or did not prefer. However, parasite-mediated exploitation seems to be dependent on the infection cycle of P. infectans. Although zoospores and mature sporangium produced from infected A. sanguinea were not ingested by the predator L. masanensis, both newly infected (i.e., cells that zoospores had just penetrated) and infected (those containing early to late trophocytes) A. sanguinea cells attracted numerous L. masanensis cells and were rapidly ingested by the predator, leading to the predator's positive growth. The results from mixed culture experiments of the three protists showed that the presence of P. infectans at low density led to co-occurrence of the three protists. Thus, the parasitoid seems to play the role of a mediator in either inedible prey- or predator-dominated environments, leading to co-occurrence of the three protists.","The authors would like to thank anonymous reviewers, whose comments and suggestions greatly improved the early version of manuscript.

However, toxicant effects within ecosystems may be altered by interactions with abiotic and biotic ecosystem components, including biological interactions. Collectively, this generates the potential for toxicant sensitivity to be highly context dependent, with significantly different outcomes in ecosystems than laboratory toxicity tests predict. We experimentally manipulated stream macroinvertebrate communities in 32 mesocosms to examine how communities from a low-salinity site were influenced by interactions with those from a high-salinity site along a gradient of salinity. Relative to those from the low-salinity site, organisms from the high-salinity site were expected to have greater tolerance and fitness at higher salinities. This created the potential for both salinity and tolerant-sensitive organism interactions to influence communities. We found that community composition was influenced by both direct toxicity and tolerant-sensitive organism interactions. Taxon and context-dependent responses included: (i) direct toxicity effects, irrespective of biotic interactions; (ii) effects that were owing to the addition of tolerant taxa, irrespective of salinity; (iii) toxicity dependent on sensitive-tolerant taxa interactions; and (iv) toxic effects that were increased by interactions. Our results reinforce that ecological processes require consideration when examining toxicant effects within ecosystems.This article is part of the theme issue 'Salt in freshwaters: causes, ecological consequences and future prospects'.","B.J.K. is grateful for discussions with Matthias Liess which influenced the decision to collect biota from a low and high salinity site.

3753,pub.1145226122,10.1002/eap.2558,35112758,,,Limitations to coral recovery along an environmental stress gradient,"Positive feedbacks driving habitat-forming species recovery and population growth are often lost as ecosystems degrade. For such systems, identifying mechanisms that limit the re-establishment of critical positive feedbacks is key to facilitating recovery. Theory predicts the primary drivers limiting system recovery shift from biological to physical as abiotic stress increases, but recent work has demonstrated that this seldom happens. We combined field and laboratory experiments to identify variation in limitations to coral recovery along an environmental stress gradient at Ningaloo Reef and Exmouth Gulf in northwest Australia. Many reefs in the region are coral depauperate due to recent cyclones and thermal stress. In general, recovery trajectories are prolonged due to limited coral recruitment. Consistent with theory, clearer water reefs under low thermal stress appear limited by biological interactions: competition with turf algae caused high mortality of newly settled corals and upright macroalgal stands drove mortality in transplanted juvenile corals. Laboratory experiments showed a positive relationship between crustose coralline algae cover and coral settlement, but only in the absence of sedimentation. Contrary to expectation, coral recovery does not appear limited by the survival or growth of recruits on turbid reefs under higher thermal stress, but to exceptionally low larval supply. Laboratory experiments showed that larval survival and settlement are unaffected by seawater quality across the study region. Rather, connectivity models predicted that many of the more turbid reefs in the Gulf are predominantly self seeded, receiving limited supply under degraded reef states. Overall, we find that the influence of oceanography can overwhelm the influences of physical and biological interactions on recovery potential at locations where environmental stressors are high, whereas populations in relatively benign physical conditions are predominantly structured by local ecological drivers. Such context-dependent information can help guide expectations and assist managers in optimizing strategies for spatial conservation planning for system recovery.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This project was funded by the Gorgon Barrow Island Net Conservation Benefits Fund administered by the Western Australian Department of Parks and Wildlife awarded to RCB and a CSIRO Office of the Chief Executive Postdoctoral Fellowship to Christopher Doropoulos.

Although the microbial biofilms are vital elements to support the proper performance of BAC filters, except for taxonomic affiliations, little is known about the assembly mechanisms of microbial communities in the full-scale BAC filters. This study aimed to examine how the assembly processes and their associated factors (e.g., influent characteristics, biological interactions) drive the temporal dynamics of bacterial communities in full-scale BAC filters, which underwent ozone implementation (five consecutive seasons from 2017 to 2018). The results revealed that along with the increase of bacterial taxonomic richness and evenness, stochastic processes became more crucial to determine the bacterial community assembly in the summer and autumn after ozone implementation (relative contribution: 61.23% and 83.75%, respectively). Moreover, their corresponding networks possessed simple network structures with lower modularity than other seasons, which implied lesser biological interactions among bacterial populations. The correlation between taxonomic and predicted functional diversities using functional redundancy index indicated that relatively high levels of bacterial functional redundancy (>0.83) were generally present in BAC filters. However, compared to other seasons, significantly higher degrees of functional redundancy existed in the summer and autumn after ozone implementation (0.85 ± 0.01 and 0.86 ± 0.01, respectively). Overall, this work improves our understanding of the microbial ecology of full-scale BAC filters by providing a conceptual framework that characterizes bacterial biofilm assembly processes relevant to performance optimization of full-scale BAC filters.","This study was supported by the National Science Foundation of United States (CBET 1605185), the Ohio Water Development Authority (7174), the University of Toledo (Interdisciplinary Research Initiation Award), and in part by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

These microorganisms in surface waters worldwide exhibit pronounced seasonal succession patterns, governed by physicochemical factors (e.g., light, climate, and nutrient loading) that are determined by latitude and distance to shore. Moreover, we emphasize that the effects of large-scale factors are modulated regionally, and over shorter timespans (days to weeks), by biological interactions including molecule exchanges, viral lysis, and grazing. Thus the interplay and scaling between factors ultimately determine the success of particular bacterial populations. Spatiotemporal surveys of bacterioplankton community composition provide the necessary frame for interpreting how the distinct metabolisms encoded in the genomes of different bacteria regulate biogeochemical cycles.","We thank Markus Lindh for valuable feedback during the development of this manuscript.

We created communities varying in exotic plant dominance, plant traits, soil biota, and invertebrate herbivores and measured indicators of carbon cycling. Interactions with soil biota and herbivores were the strongest drivers of exotic plant effects, particularly on measures of soil carbon turnover. Moreover, plant traits related to growth and nutrient acquisition explained differences in the ways that exotic plants interacted with novel biota compared with natives.

However, little is known about the respective effects involving positive biological interactions, including the symbiosis between plants and ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi. Using a greenhouse bioassay, we explored how spatial heterogeneity of natural soil inoculum influences the performance of pine seedlings and composition of their root-associated EM fungi. When the inoculum was homogenously distributed, a single EM fungal taxon dominated the roots of most pine seedlings, reducing the diversity of EM fungi at the treatment level, while substantially improving pine seedling performance. In contrast, clumped inoculum allowed the proliferation of several different EM fungi, increasing the overall EM fungal diversity. The most dominant EM fungal taxon detected in the homogeneous treatment was also a highly beneficial mutualist, implying that the trade-off between competitive ability and mutualistic capacity does not always exist.",This research was co‐supported by the United States‐Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF Grant 2012081) and Tel‐Hai College.

Yet, little information exists on epiphytic communities developing on seagrass seedlings. Moreover, for some species our knowledge about seedling performance is limited to early establishment phases, and the role of substrate type in affecting their growth is still unclear. These are considerable knowledge gaps, as seedlings play an important role in meadow expansion and recovery from disturbance. In this study, seedlings of Posidonia oceanica, a keystone species of the Mediterranean, were grown in a shallow (1.5 m deep) coastal area along the Tuscany coast (Italy). After five years of growth (July 2009), seedlings were collected and, through multivariate analysis, we examined whether the epiphytic communities of leaves (both internal and external side) and rhizomes, as well as the growth characteristics differed between rock and sand substrate. The epiphytic communities of seedlings largely reflected those found on adult shoots. Epiphyte cover was similar between the two leaf sides, and it was higher on seedlings grown on rock than on sand, with encrusting algae dominating the community. No differences in epiphyte cover and community structure on rhizomes were found between substrates. Seedling growth characteristics did not differ between substrates, apart from the number of standing leaves being higher on rock than on sand. No correlation was found among epiphyte communities and seedling growth variables (i.e., leaf area, maximum leaf length, number of leaves, total number of leaves produced, rhizome length, total biomass, and root to shoot biomass ratio). Results indicate that epiphytes successfully colonize P. oceanica seedlings, and the surrounding micro-environment (i.e., substrate type) can influence the leaf epiphytic community. This study provides new valuable insights on the biological interactions occurring in seagrass ecosystems and highlights the need for better understanding the effects of seedling epiphytes and substrate on the formation of new meadows.","We sincerely thank Flavia Vallerini, Ph.D. for her valuable help in collecting P. oceanica seedlings in the field.",Funding.

Recent technological advances in data collection and management have transformed our understanding of animal ""movement ecology"" (the integrated study of organismal movement), creating a big-data discipline that benefits from rapid, cost-effective generation of large amounts of data on movements of animals in the wild. These high-throughput wildlife tracking systems now allow more thorough investigation of variation among individuals and species across space and time, the nature of biological interactions, and behavioral responses to the environment. Movement ecology is rapidly expanding scientific frontiers through large interdisciplinary and collaborative frameworks, providing improved opportunities for conservation and insights into the movements of wild animals, and their causes and consequences.","We thank V.

3561,pub.1120798636,10.1111/1755-0998.13079,31482665,,,Incorporating phylogenetic metrics to microbial co‐occurrence networks based on amplicon sequences to discern community assembly processes,"Co-occurrence network analysis based on amplicon sequences is increasingly used to study microbial communities. Patterns of co-existence or mutual exclusion between pairs of taxa are often interpreted as reflecting positive or negative biological interactions. However, other assembly processes can underlie these patterns, including species failure to reach distant areas (dispersal limitation) and tolerate local environmental conditions (habitat filtering). We provide a tool to quantify the relative contribution of community assembly processes to microbial co-occurrence patterns, which we applied to explore soil bacterial communities in two dry ecosystems. First, we sequenced a bacterial phylogenetic marker in soils collected across multiple plots. Second, we inferred co-occurrence networks to identify pairs of significantly associated taxa, either co-existing more (aggregated) or less often (segregated) than expected at random. Third, we assigned assembly processes to each pair: patterns explained based on spatial or environmental distance were ascribed to dispersal limitation (2%-4%) or habitat filtering (55%-77%), and the remaining to biological interactions. Finally, we calculated the phylogenetic distance between taxon pairs to test theoretical expectations on the linkages between phylogenetic patterns and assembly processes. Aggregated pairs were more closely related than segregated pairs. Furthermore, habitat-filtered aggregated pairs were closer relatives than those assigned to positive interactions, consistent with phylogenetic niche conservatism and cooperativism among distantly related taxa. Negative interactions resulted in equivocal phylogenetic signatures, probably because different competitive processes leave opposing signals. We show that microbial co-occurrence networks mainly reflect environmental tolerances and propose that incorporating measures of phylogenetic relatedness to networks might help elucidate ecologically meaningful patterns.",Financial support was provided by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (CGL2014‐58333‐P; CGL2017‐89751‐R) and the Generalitat Valenciana (SEJI/2017/030).

Microcosms, surface area 104 cm2, containing a c. 7-cm thick layer of sieved (0.5 mm) sublittoral mud were established in June 1990. Two months later the tellinid bivalve Macoma balthica was added in quantities varying from 0 to 40 individuals per microcosm. After 5 months the effects of the bivalves on the meiofauna were surprisingly small. The density of harpacticoid copepods was lowest (P <0.05) in microcosms containing a high density of M. balthica. It is suggested that competition for food resources was responsible for this pattern. For all other meiofaunal groups, including nematodes which were the most abundant taxon (99%), no significant differences (P>0.05) were observed among treatments. The assemblage structure of the nematodes was similar between treatments. The vertical distribution of both major taxa and nematode species appeared to be unaffected by the presence of the bivalve.",,,Oecologia,,Springer Nature,"0029-8549, 1432-1939",,1993-04,1993,,1993-04,93,4,457-462,Closed,Article,"Olafsson, Emil; Elmgren, Ragnar; Papakosta, Ourania","Olafsson, Emil (Department of Zoology and Askö Laboratory, Stockholm University, S-106 91, Stockholm, Sweden); Elmgren, Ragnar (Department of Zoology and Askö Laboratory, Stockholm University, S-106 91, Stockholm, Sweden; Department of Systems Ecology, Stockholm University, S-106 91, Stockholm, Sweden); Papakosta, Ourania (Department of Zoology and Askö Laboratory, Stockholm University, S-106 91, Stockholm, Sweden)",,"Olafsson, Emil (Stockholm University); Elmgren, Ragnar (Stockholm University; Stockholm University); Papakosta, Ourania (Stockholm University)",Stockholm University,grid.10548.38,Stockholm,,Sweden,,,,,,27,1,0.16,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1007408681,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,

To analyze these data, we developed a multispecies N-mixture model that allowed estimation of both positive and negative correlations between abundances of different species while also estimating the effects of habitat and the effects of errors in detection of each species. Using a combination of single- and multispecies N-mixture modeling, we examined for each species whether our measures of habitat were sufficient to account for the variation in encounter histories of individual birds or whether other habitat variables or interactions with other species needed to be considered. In the community that we studied, habitat appeared to be more influential than biological interactions in determining the distribution and abundance of most avian species. Our results lend support to the hypothesis that abundances of forest specialists are negatively affected by forest fragmentation. Our results also suggest that many species were associated with particular types of vegetation as measured by structural attributes of the forests. The abundances of 6 of the 73 species observed in our study were strongly correlated. These species included large birds (American Crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos) and Red-winged Blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus)) that forage on the ground in open habitats and small birds (Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceus), House Wren (Troglodytes aedon), Hooded Warbler (Setophaga citrina), and Prairie Warbler (Setophaga discolor)) that are associated with dense shrub cover. Species abundances were positively correlated within each size group and negatively correlated between groups. Except for the American Crow, which preys on eggs and nestlings of small song birds, none of the other 5 species is known to display direct interactions, so we suspect that the correlations may have been associated with species-specific responses to habitat components not adequately measured by our covariates.","This work was supported by National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis (NIMBIOS), which was sponsored by the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture through NSF Award \#EF-0832858.

However, the ability of microorganisms to release volatile compounds has only attracted research attention in the past decade. Recent research has revealed that microbial volatiles are chemically very diverse and have important roles in distant interactions and communication. Microbial volatiles can diffuse fast in both gas and water phases, and thus can mediate swift chemical interactions. As well as constitutively emitted volatiles, microorganisms can emit induced volatiles that are triggered by biological interactions or environmental cues. In this Review, we highlight recent discoveries concerning microbial volatile compounds and their roles in intra-kingdom microbial interactions and inter-kingdom interactions with plants and insects. Furthermore, we indicate the potential biotechnological applications of microbial volatiles and discuss challenges and perspectives in this emerging research field.",The Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO‐KNAW) publication number is 7063.

This review focusses on the interactions between macroalgae and their Epiphytic Bacterial Community (EBC); the main aims are to ascertain whether (1) the epiphytic bacterial groups differ at the phylum and genus levels of the macroalgae; (2) the methodologies used so far to study these microorganisms are related in any way to eventual variations of the EBCs on macroalgae; and (3) the EBC of macroalgae has a functional means rather a simple taxonomic grouping. Results showed firstly the taxonomic grouping of macroalgae does not explain the composition and structure of the EBCs. Secondly, the methodology used is important for describing EBCs; and thirdly, multiple bacteria can have the same function and thus to describe the functionality of EBCs it is important to recognize host-specific and generalist bacteria. We recommend the incorporation of a complementary approach between the taxonomic composition and the functional composition analyzes of EBCs, as well as the use of methodological tools that allow analysis of interactions between the EBCs and their hosts, based on the ""holobiont"" concept.","Special thanks to Ana María Zárate for her support and orientation in the elaboration of the heatmaps, using R software and Susan Angus for translating the manuscript.","Funding.

However, the success of coordinated management is highly sensitive to biological, economic, and social conditions. Here, using a game theoretic framework and a 2-species model that considers various biological relationships (competition, predation, and mutualism), we compute cooperative (or joint) and non-cooperative (or separate) management equilibrium outcomes of the model and investigate the effects of the type and strength of the relationships. We find that cooperation does not always show superiority to non-cooperation in all biological interactions: (1) if and only if resources are involved in high-intensity predation relationships, cooperation can achieve a win-win scenario for ecosystem services and resource diversity; (2) for competitive resources, cooperation realizes higher ecosystem services by sacrificing resource diversity; and (3) for mutual resources, cooperation has no obvious advantage for either ecosystem services or resource evenness but can slightly improve resource abundance. Furthermore, by using a fishery model of the North California Current Marine Ecosystem with 63 species and seven fleets, we demonstrate that the theoretical results can be reproduced in real ecosystems. Therefore, effective ecosystem management should consider the interconnection between stakeholders' social relationship and resources' biological relationships.","The National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 71303217, 31370354 and 31470463) and the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. LY17G030030).

Far from being synonymous with toxicity and harm, biological ROS production is increasingly recognized for its essential functions in signaling, growth, biological interactions, and physiochemical defense systems in a diversity of organisms, spanning microbes to mammals. Part of this shift in thinking can be attributed to the wide phylogenetic distribution of specialized mechanisms for ROS production, such as NADPH oxidases, which decouple intracellular and extracellular ROS pools by directly catalyzing the reduction of oxygen in the surrounding aqueous environment. Furthermore, biological ROS production contributes substantially to natural fluxes of ROS in the ocean, thereby influencing the fate of carbon, metals, oxygen, and climate-relevant gases.

In this study, we compared benthic foraminiferal assemblages from two common macroalgal habitats, Turf and Coralline algae, based on ecological monitoring of a thermally polluted station representing near future warming, and an undisturbed environment. None of the common local species is confined to a specific algal habitat. This implies that their existence is not threatened by the disappearance of the Coralline algae. However, most likely their community structure will be impacted with coastal warming. Species that are more affiliated with Coralline algae are highly thermally tolerant, thus their proliferation might be reduced with warming. Specifically, the negative response of Coralline algae to warming may limit the contribution of invasive species such as Pararotalia calcariformata.","We are grateful for the technical help provided by Yaron Gartner, Erez Hagai, and Elad Israeli from the Israel Oceanographic and Limnological Research (IOLR).

Here, we tested if protection from fishing promotes community resilience in temperate reef communities undergoing rapid warming in Tasmania. Regardless of protection status, we detected a signature of warming in the brown macroalgae, invertebrates and fishes, through increases in the local richness and abundance of warm-affinity species. Even so, responses in protected communities diverged from exploited communities. At the local scale, the number of cool-affinity fishes and canopy-forming algal species increased following protection, even though the observation window fell within a period of warming. At the same time, exploited communities gained turf algal and sessile invertebrate species. We further found that the recovery of predator populations following protection leads to marked declines in mobile invertebrates-this trend could be incorrectly attributed to warming without contextual data quantifying community change across trophic levels. By comparing long-term change in exploited and protected reefs, we empirically demonstrate the role of biological interactions in both facilitating and resisting climate-related biodiversity change. We further highlight the potential for trophic interactions to alter the progression of both range expansions and contractions.","We thank the many field technicians who assisted with diving surveys over the 21-year monitoring period, P.

Absorption rate and efficiency of four Asellus aquaticus (L.) populations from differently polluted habitats were quantified with respect to the microbial guilds colonizing detritus. A twin tracer method was used. Detritus was microbially colonized in standard conditions and on each stream bottom to control for potential resource-independent variations among individuals. The relationship between length and weight was also determined on a random sample of individuals of each population. Differences of 14.6% in potential absorption efficiency and 11.3% in potential absorption rate were observed between populations from the least and the most polluted habitat. Actual (“realized”) variations were much stronger: from a minimum of a 60.1% reduction in absorption efficiency to a maximum of 93.8% for the rate. The realized food absorption and the individual weight per length showed the same pattern of variation among populations. This suggested that the availability of energy to isopods in nature was related to stream pollution and resource quality. Bottomup interactions appear to be the most relevant pathway through which chemical water pollution affects the Asellus populations studied. The potential resource-independent variations among individuals are also likely to be explained by temporal cascading of resource-mediated effects.,,,Oecologia,,Springer Nature,"0029-8549, 1432-1939",,1993-03,1993,,1993-03,93,3,315-321,Closed,Article,"Basset, A.","Basset, A.

The metolachlor degradation rates enhanced by 33%-36% upon the introduction of electrodes after 23 d. In closed MFCs, the abundance of Mortierella as the most dominant genus increased to 43%-54% from 17% in the original soil, whereas those of Aphanoascus and Penicillium decreased to 0.24%-0.39% and 0.38-0.72% from 14% to 11%, respectively. Additionally, a 10-fold amplification of unique OTUs was observed, mainly from increase on the electrode surface. The different treatments were clustered, especially samples near the cathode. The linear discriminant analysis showed that Aphanoascus fulvescens acted as a biomarker between the original and treated soils. The co-occurrence networks demonstrated that Mortierella universally competed for growth with coexisting species while Cladosporium exhibited the most affiliations with species from the 36 other genera present. The correlation analysis indicated that the species associated with degradation belonged to Mortierella, Kernia, Chaetomium and Trichosporon, while the species associated with electrogenesis were Debaryomyces hansenii and Mortierella polycephala.

In particular, the interplay between biological interactions and the physics underlying the swarming dynamics is of both biological and physical interest. In this paper, we study mixed swarms of Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We find intricate interactions between the species, showing both cooperation and segregation across different spatial and temporal scales. On one hand, even though axenic colonies grow on disparate time scale, an order of magnitude apart, the two-species swarm together, forming a single, combined colony. However, the rapidly moving populations are locally segregated, with different characteristic speeds and lengths (or cluster sizes) that depend on the ratio between the species. Comparison with controlled mutant strains suggest that both the physical and known biological differences in species characteristics may not be enough to explain the segregation between the species in the mixed swarm. We hypothesize that the heterogeneous spatial distribution is due to some mechanism that enables bacteria to recognize their own kind, whose precise origin we could not identify.","We thank J. D.

Recruitment of larvae into benthic habitats largely depends on biological interactions and favourable environmental conditions such as the inescapable diurnal thermal and tidal exposures. Hence, assessing how different taxa metabolically respond to variations in temperature is imperative to understand the community and ecosystem dynamics at both local and global scales. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of acute temperature variation on the physiology of stage-specific brachyuran larvae collected from different microhabitats at two mangrove forests in South Africa. Results indicate that the conditions within microhabitats, which larvae experience, likely influence their physiology, based on respirometry, to short-term acute temperature exposures. Furthermore, the larval thermal optimum shifted ontogenetically to become increasingly eurythermic as individuals developed from stage I zoea through to megalopa. Mangrove crab larvae in their early stages are hence increasingly vulnerable to acute temperature exposures, which could be particularly harmful to the persistence of populations if thermally stressful events increase in magnitude and frequency.","The authors have no conflict of interest to declare that are relevant to the content of this article.

In this study the effectiveness of the Hsp60 as indicator of biotic stresses in the scleractinian coral Acropora muricata was analyzed, considering the whole holobiont. We focused on two biological interactions recognized to be important contributors to coral reef degradation such as a coral disease, the Skeleton eroding band (SEB) caused by the protozoan Halofolliculina corallasia and the algal overgrowth. In the lagoon of Magoodhoo Island (Maldives) fragments of living tissue of A. muricata exposed to these biotic factors were sampled and proteins subjected to Western analysis. The two different biological interactions trigger diverse responses on Hsp60 level. No detectable effect on Hsp60 modulation appeared in colonies subjected to algal overgrowth. On the contrary, corals displayed a robust up-regulation of Hsp60 in the fragments sampled just above the SEB dark band, where the level of Hsp60 was almost twice compared to the control colonies, indicating that the aggressive behavior of the protozoan causes cellular damage also in coral portions neighboring and along the advancing front of the infection. Portions of coral sampled distant to the SEB band showed a Hsp60 level comparable to that observed in healthy colonies.

Recovery in the field does not depend on the chemical's properties and type of exposure only, but it is strongly linked to important environmental variables and biological interactions as well. Yet, these remain only marginally considered in the European risk assessment of chemicals. Here, we use individual-based modelling to investigate how the environmental scenario affects Daphnia magna population recovery from chemical exposure. Simulation experiments were performed for chemicals with lethality levels ranging from 40% to 90% at different food and temperature conditions. The same toxicity levels were then tested in combination with biological interactions including predation or competition. Results show that for the same chemical effect strength, populations often exhibited different recovery times in a different environmental context. The interactions between the chemical and the environmental variables were the strongest determinants of population recovery. Most important, biotic interactions even induced opposite effects on recovery at low and at high mortality levels. Results of this study infer that no specific role can be attributed to any abiotic or biotic variable in isolation. We conclude that unless the complex interactive mechanisms between the different factors constituting the full environmental scenario are taken into account in risk assessment, we cannot achieve a complete understanding of recovery processes from chemical effects.","This work has been financially supported by the European Union under the 7th Framework Programme (Project acronym CREAM, contract number PITN-GA-2009-238148) and the CEFIC LRI award (2011).",,Aquatic Toxicology,,Elsevier,"0166-445X, 1879-1514","Animals; Daphnia; Environment; Models, Theoretical; Predatory Behavior; Risk Assessment; Water Pollutants, Chemical",2014-09-17,2014,2014-09-17,2014-11,156,,221-229,Closed,Article,"Gabsi, Faten; Preuss, Thomas G.","Gabsi, Faten (Institute for Environmental Research, RWTH Aachen University, Worringerweg 1, 52074 Aachen, Germany); Preuss, Thomas G.

Synechococcus exhibits high phylogenetical and phenotypical diversity, and horizontal gene transfer makes its genetic evolution much more intricate. With the development of measurement technologies and analysis methods, the genomic information and niche partition of each Synechococcus lineage tend to be precisely described, but the global analysis is still lacking. Therefore, it is necessary to summarize existing studies and integrate published data to gain a comprehensive understanding of Synechococcus on genetic variation, niche division, and potential functions. In this review, the maximum likelihood trees are constructed based on existing sequence data, including both phylogenetic and pigmentary gene markers. The global distribution characteristics of abundance, lineages, and pigment types are concluded through pooled analysis of more than 700 samples obtained from approximately 50 scientific research cruises. The potential functions of Synechococcus are explored in element cycles and biological interactions. Future work on Synechococcus is suggested to focus on not only elucidating the nature of Synechococcus biodiversity but also demonstrating its interactions with the ecosystem by combining bioinformatics and macroscopic isotope-labeled environmental parameters.","This study is financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2018YFD0901102), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 42176131), and the Key Deployment Project of Centre for Ocean Mega-Research of Science, Chinese Academy of Science (No. COMS2020Q09).

Like most interactions, parasitism may be influenced by environmental conditions. Therefore, changes caused by human activity may drastically affect the equilibrium of the assemblages of parasitized organisms (hosts). Herein, we described the composition of hemoparasites of anurans from two distinct environments: forest and oil palm plantations. We identified the most frequent groups of blood parasites, and whether infections differ between habitats (forest and plantation) and between microhabitats (arboreal or terrestrial). We collected 128 anurans, of which 46 (36%) were parasitized by hemoparasites. The genus Trypanosoma spp. was found in 30% (n = 37/128) of the infected anurans in both habitats, recorded mostly in terrestrial anurans in oil palm plantations. Apicomplexa hemoprotozoans were also found in 13% (n=17/128) of the anurans, which mainly were terrestrial species collected in oil palm plantations. There was no difference in parasitism between the two assemblies and between the studied microhabitats. This is the first study that has analyzed the ecological relationship between anurans as hosts and their blood parasites, in a region under intense anthropic pressure, in the Brazilian Amazon.",We thank to Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) for scholarship grants to SRCP; Zoology Post-graduation program of UFPA/MPEG; Partnerships for International Research and Education (PIRE-USA); International Conservation – Brazil (CI) and AGROPALMA Company.

Despite their numerous dominance and functional importance, understanding soil viral ecology is a formidable challenge, because of the technological challenges to characterize the abundance, diversity and community compositions of viruses, and their interactions with other organisms in the complex soil environment. Viruses may engage in a myriad of biological interactions within soil food webs across a broad range of spatiotemporal scales and are exposed to various biotic and abiotic disturbances. Current studies on the soil viromes, however, often describe the complexity of their tremendous diversity, but lack of exploring their potential ecological roles. In this article, we summarized the major methods to decipher the ecology of soil viruses, discussed biotic and abiotic factors and global change factors that shape the diversity and composition of soil viromes, and the ecological roles of soil viruses. We also proposed a new framework to understand the ecological complexity of viruses from micro to macro ecosystem scales and to predict and unravel their activities in terrestrial ecosystems.",This work was financially supported by the National Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 41907028 and 41771289) and the Australian Research Council (DP210100332).,,The Science of The Total Environment,,Elsevier,"0048-9697, 1879-1026",Ecosystem; Food Chain; Microbiota; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Virome,2021-12-07,2021,2021-12-07,2022-03,812,,152217,Closed,Article,"Bi, Li; Yu, Dan-Ting; Han, Li-Li; Du, Shuai; Yuan, Cheng-Yu; He, Ji-Zheng; Hu, Hang-Wei","Bi, Li (School of Agriculture and Food, Faculty of Veterinary and Agricultural Sciences, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria 3010, Australia.); Yu, Dan-Ting (State Key Laboratory for Subtropical Mountain Ecology of the Ministry of Science and Technology and Fujian Province, Fujian Normal University, Fujian 350007, China; School of Geographical Sciences, Fujian Normal University, Fujian 350007, China.

Here we analyse statistical relationships between multi-decadal satellite-derived time series of the frequency of cyanobacteria surface accumulations (FCA) in the central Baltic Sea Proper and a suite of environmental variables. Over the decadal scale (∼5-20 years) FCA was highly correlated (R2 ∼ 0.69) with a set of biogeochemical variables related to the amount of phosphorus and hypoxia in bottom layers. Water temperature in the surface layer was also positively correlated with FCA at the decadal scale. In contrast, the inter-annual variations in FCA had no correlation with the biogeochemical variables. Instead, significant correlations were found with the solar shortwave direct flux in July and the sea-surface temperature, also in July. It thus appears that it is not possible to predict inter-annual fluctuations in cyanobacteria blooms from water chemistry. Moreover, environmental variables could only explain about 45% of the inter-annual variability in FCA, probably because year-to-year variations in FCA are significantly influenced by biological interactions.","Financial support was provided by the Stockholm University’s Baltic Sea Centre and its Baltic Ecosystem Adaptive Management Program and the Leibniz-Institut für Ostseeforschung Warnemünde (IOW).

They are both micro and macroorganisms with high and varying functional diversity as well as great variation in dispersal modes. With our growing knowledge of microbial biogeography, it has become increasingly clear that fungal assembly patterns and processes differ from other microorganisms such as bacteria, but also from macroorganisms such as plants. The success of fungi as organisms and their influence on the environment lies in their ability to span multiple dimensions of time, space, and biological interactions, that is not rivalled by other organism groups. There is also growing evidence that fungi mediate links between different organisms and ecosystems, with the potential to affect the macroecology and evolution of those organisms. This suggests that fungal interactions are an ecological driving force, interconnecting different levels of biological and ecological organisation of their hosts, competitors, and antagonists with the environment and ecosystem functioning. Here we review these emerging lines of evidence by focusing on the dynamics of fungal interactions with other organism groups across various ecosystems. We conclude that the mediating role of fungi through their complex and dynamic ecological interactions underlie their importance and ubiquity across Earth's ecosystems.",The authors apologize to colleagues whose work was not discussed in this review.

3103,pub.1137657588,10.1093/icb/icab057,33944910,,,Bivalve molluscs as model systems for studying mitochondrial biology,"The class Bivalvia is a highly successful and ancient taxon including ∼25,000 living species. During their long evolutionary history bivalves adapted to a wide range of physicochemical conditions, habitats, biological interactions, and feeding habits. Bivalves can have strikingly different size, and despite their apparently simple body plan, they evolved very different shell shapes, and complex anatomic structures. One of the most striking features of this class of animals is their peculiar mitochondrial biology: some bivalves have facultatively anaerobic mitochondria that allow them to survive prolonged periods of anoxia/hypoxia. Moreover, more than 100 species have now been reported showing the only known evolutionarily stable exception to the strictly maternal inheritance of mitochondria in animals, named doubly uniparental inheritance. Mitochondrial activity is fundamental to eukaryotic life, and thanks to their diversity and uncommon features, bivalves represent a great model system to expand our knowledge about mitochondrial biology, so far limited to a few species. We highlight recent works studying mitochondrial biology in bivalves at either genomic or physiological level.

While light availability is, overall, the external driver of the seasonal changes, several internal biological interactions structure the bacterial community during shorter timescales. These include specific phytoplankton-bacteria associations, viral infections and other top-down controls. Here, we uncover these microbial interactions and their effects on the bacterial community composition during a full annual cycle by manipulating the microbial food web using size fractionation. The most profound community changes were detected during the spring, with 'mutualistic phytoplankton'-Gammaproteobacteria interactions dominating in the pre-bloom phase and 'substrate-dependent phytoplankton'-Flavobacteria interactions during blooming conditions. Bacterivores had an overall limited effect on the bacterial community composition most of the year. However, in the late summer, grazing was the main factor shaping the community composition and transferring carbon to higher trophic levels. Identifying these small-scale interactions improves our understanding of the Arctic marine microbial food web and its dynamics.",We would like to thank the crew members of the Norwegian Research Vessels RV Helmer Hanssen and RV Lance for their assistance in the sampling expeditions and all colleagues in the UiB Marine Microbiology group and collaborators abroad who contributed to the research effort.,,Microorganisms,,MDPI,2076-2607,,2021-11-17,2021,2021-11-17,,9,11,2378,All OA; Gold,Article,"Müller, Oliver; Seuthe, Lena; Pree, Bernadette; Bratbak, Gunnar; Larsen, Aud; Paulsen, Maria Lund","Müller, Oliver (Department of Biological Sciences, University of Bergen, 5006 Bergen, Norway;, Bernadette.Pree@uib.no, (B.P.);, Gunnar.Bratbak@uib.no, (G.B.)); Seuthe, Lena (Department of Arctic and Marine Biology, UiT—The Arctic University of Norway, 9037 Tromsø, Norway;, lena.seuthe@uit.no); Pree, Bernadette (Department of Biological Sciences, University of Bergen, 5006 Bergen, Norway;, Bernadette.Pree@uib.no, (B.P.);, Gunnar.Bratbak@uib.no, (G.B.)); Bratbak, Gunnar (Department of Biological Sciences, University of Bergen, 5006 Bergen, Norway;, Bernadette.Pree@uib.no, (B.P.);, Gunnar.Bratbak@uib.no, (G.B.)); Larsen, Aud (Molecular Ecology Group, NORCE, 5008 Bergen, Norway;, aula@norceresearch.no); Paulsen, Maria Lund (Arctic Research Center, Department of Ecoscience, Aarhus University, 8600 Silkeborg, Denmark;, mlp@bios.au.dk)","Müller, Oliver (University of Bergen)","Müller, Oliver (University of Bergen); Seuthe, Lena (UiT The Arctic University of Norway); Pree, Bernadette (University of Bergen); Bratbak, Gunnar (University of Bergen); Larsen, Aud (Norwegian Research Centre); Paulsen, Maria Lund (Aarhus University)",UiT The Arctic University of Norway; Aarhus University; University of Bergen; Norwegian Research Centre,grid.10919.30; grid.7048.b; grid.7914.b; grid.509009.5,Tromsø; Aarhus; Bergen; Bergen,; ; Hordaland; ,Norway; Denmark; Norway; Norway,Southern and Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority; The Research Council of Norway,cOAlition S,Norway; Norway,grant.4667007; grant.4659451; grant.7914422; grant.7572775; grant.9422709,226415; 225956; 280292; 276730; 2015096,1,1,,0.42,,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/9/11/2378/pdf?version=1637230585,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143280311,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3107 Microbiology,Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,

Recent metagenomics-based approaches revealed a widespread abundance of archaea, including ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) of Thaumarchaeota in non-extreme and oxic environments. AOA alter nitrogen species availability by mediating the first step of chemolithoautotrophic nitrification, ammonia oxidation to nitrite, and are important primary producers in ecosystems, which affects the distribution and activity of other organisms in ecosystems. Thus, information on the interactions of AOA with other cohabiting organisms is a crucial element in understanding nitrogen and carbon cycles in ecosystems as well as the functioning of whole ecosystems. AOA are self-nourishing, and thus interactions of AOA with other organisms can often be indirect and broad. Besides, there are possibilities of specific and obligate interactions. Mechanisms of interaction are often not clearly identified but only inferred due to limited knowledge on the interaction factors analyzed by current technologies. Here, we overviewed different types of AOA interactions with other cohabiting organisms, which contribute to understanding AOA functions in ecosystems.","This work was supported by a grant from the National Institute of Biological Resources (NIBR), funded by the Ministry of Environment (MOE) of the Republic of Korea (NIBR202102104) and Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (2020R1A6A1A06046235).

Their survival in such a wide range of ecological niches is due to their impressive physiological and respiratory versatility. Some strains are among the organisms with the highest number of respiratory systems, depending on a complex and rich metabolic network. Implicated in the recycling of organic and inorganic matter, they are important components of organism-rich oxic/anoxic interfaces, but they also belong to the microflora of a broad group of eukaryotes from metazoans to green algae. Examples of long-term biological interactions like mutualism or pathogeny have been described, although molecular determinants of such symbioses are still poorly understood. Some of these bacteria are key organisms for various biotechnological applications, especially the bioremediation of hydrocarbons and metallic pollutants.

Studies have focused on predation and competition, but infection has been overlooked, despite being a determining factor of distribution and species diversity of prey. We hypothesized that the winter migration of Daphnia pulicaria is a community defense strategy to avoid fungal infection. To test this hypothesis, environmental variables and the Cladocera community, including D. pulicaria, were monitored in three study sections of the Anri Reservoir in the Republic of Korea during September 2010-August 2015. During three winter seasons, the density of infected D. pulicaria increased in all study sections, and they migrated from the central to the littoral area. Most of the infected individuals had dormant eggs in sexually reproducing mothers. However, when the proportion of non-infected individuals was higher than that of infected individuals, winter migration was not observed. Additional microcosm experiments showed that dormant eggs of D. pulicaria obtained from ice crystals in the littoral area had lower hatching and infection rates than those obtained from mothers moving from other zones. Therefore, the migration of D. pulicaria during winter is an active response to avoid intergenerational fungal infection.",,"This research was supported by a grant from the National Institute of Ecology (NIE), funded by the Ministry of Environment (MOE) of South Korea (NIE-A-2022-01).",Biology,,MDPI,2079-7737,,2022-09-27,2022,2022-09-27,,11,10,1409,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kim, Seong-Ki; Choi, Jong-Yun","Kim, Seong-Ki (National Institute of Ecology, Seo-Cheon Gun 33657, Chungcheongnam-do, Korea.); Choi, Jong-Yun (National Institute of Ecology, Seo-Cheon Gun 33657, Chungcheongnam-do, Korea.)","Choi, Jong-Yun (National Institute of Ecology)","Kim, Seong-Ki (National Institute of Ecology); Choi, Jong-Yun (National Institute of Ecology)",National Institute of Ecology,grid.496435.9,Gunsan,,South Korea,,,,,,0,0,,,2,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-7737/11/10/1409/pdf?version=1664277119,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151394150,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,Infectious Diseases,Infection,,,,A05 Biological Sciences,

Plants represent an interesting example of phenotypic plasticity which also directly represents and affects the dynamics of biological interactions occurring in a community. Insects, which interact with plants, manifest phenotypic plasticity in their developmental, physiological, morphological or behavioral traits in response to the various host plant defenses induced upon herbivory. However, plant-insect interactions are generally more complex and multidimensional because of their dynamic association with their respective microbiomes and macrobiomes. Moreover, these associations can alter plant and insect responses towards each other by modulating the degree of phenotypic plasticity in their various traits and studying them will provide insights into how plants and insects reciprocally affect each other's evolutionary trajectory. Further, we explore the consequences of phenotypic plasticity on relationships and interactions between plants and insects and its impact on their development, evolution, speciation and ecological organization. This overview, obtained after exploring and comparing data obtained from several inter-disciplinary studies, reveals how genetic and molecular mechanisms, underlying plasticity in traits, impact species interactions at the community level and also identifies mechanisms that could be exploited in breeding programs.","Research on plant–insect interactions in SN’s laboratory is partially supported by core grants from ICGEB, extramural funding from the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India.

However, it is difficult to grasp the whole picture of an individual system, because the activity of pollinators fluctuates depending on the flowering period and time of day. In order to reveal effective pollinator taxa and timing of visitation to the reproductive success of plants under the complex biological interactions and fluctuating abiotic factors, we developed an automatic system to take photographs at 5-s intervals to get near-complete flower visitation by pollinators during the entire flowering period of selected flowers of Nelumbo nucifera and track the reproductive success of the same flowers until fruiting. Bee visits during the early morning hours of 05:00–07:59 on the second day of flowering under optimal temperatures with no rainfall or strong winds contributed strongly to seed set, with possible indirect negative effects by predators of the pollinators.

Bacterial community and tet(A) abundances in water samples collected from wetlands were strongly influenced by cladoceran presence. The presence of Daphnia obtusa dramatically decreased ARB and tet(A) abundance compared to that with other cladoceran species (Chydorus sphaericus and Simocephalus vetulus). Interestingly, we found a high abundance of Flavobacteriales in the microbiomes of cladoceran species. Considering that Flavobacteriales species are potential carriers of the tet(A) gene, their adsorption and assimilation with cladocerans could significantly impact the reduction of tet(A) in water. Field surveys also showed that tet(A) abundance could be low if the dominance of D. obtusa in each wetland was high.

However, little is known about how abiotic and biotic environments on a geographic scale relate to diversifications of the emission. Here, we present variations of terpenes stored in and emitted from leaves of a single species in a common garden, using genetically differentiated local populations of Japanese cedar, the most dominant and widely distributed tree species in Japan. Furthermore, we determined the composition of fungal communities in 50 locations, based on the presence or absence of 158 fungal species inhabiting the cedar. The results showed that terpenoids, especially those that are emitted, were highly diversified and geographically structured among the 12 populations. The total amount of stored terpenes was negatively affected by warm and less-snow climates. On the other hand, variations in some emitted terpenoid species among the populations were correlated to antagonistic fungal species inhabiting the Japanese cedar. We propose that the diversification of composition and amount of stored and emitted terpenoids in the tree species is not only structured by climate, but also antagonistic fungal communities through biological interactions.","We thank the staff of Kawatabi Field Science Center, Tohoku University, for supporting our fieldwork, W.

These organisms maintain complex biological interactions with their gut symbiotic communities, including bacteria, protists, and metazoans. Very little is known about symbionts since most of the species of Passalidae haven't been studied from a parasitological point of view. Here we describe a new genus and 2 new species of nematodes of the family Hystrignathidae associated with 2 beetle species of the tribe Proculini collected in the State of Oaxaca, Mexico. Tuhmai garciaprietoi n. gen., n. sp., found in Vindex agnoscendus is characterized by the presence of an unarmed cervical cuticle, a subcylindrical procorpus and a conspicuous isthmus, a monodelphic-prodelphic reproductive system, and a short subulate tail. Urbanonema osorioi n. sp., found in Verres hageni mainly differs from other species of Urbanonema by the number and disposition of cervical spines, as well as by a subulate tail. For each new taxon, we describe the external and internal morphology, and we generated molecular data (nuclear ribosomal DNA) to place the new taxa in a phylogenetic context.","We thank Martn Zurita Garca and Jos G.

Microbial habitats can be affected by marine nutrient dynamics and may provide a clue to predict microbial responses to environmental heterogeneity in estuarine–coastal zones. We surveyed surface seawater in Gwangyang Bay, a semi-enclosed estuary in Korea, from 2016 to 2018 using a metabarcoding approach with prokaryotic 16S and eukaryotic 18S rRNA genes. Bacterial and microeukaryotic communities in these waters showed distinct local communities in response to environmental heterogeneity and community transition at spatiotemporal scales in the estuarine–coastal zone. The relative abundance of prokaryotic and eukaryotic operational taxonomic units suggested a microbial trophic interaction in the Gwangyang Bay waters. We found that the community assembly process in prokaryotic communities was primarily influenced by biological interaction (immigration–emigration), whereas that in eukaryotic communities was more affected by environmental stress (habitat specificity) rather than by biotic factors. Our findings in the Gwangyang Bay waters may provide information on underlying (biotic or abiotic) factors of the assembly process in microbial communities in the estuarine–coastal zone.","This study was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2019R1I1A1A01058140 and NRF-2016R1D1A3B01012231), by a part of the projects titled ‘Long-term Marine Ecosystem Research&#x27; and &#x27;Analysis acquisition and application study of microbiome on marine organisms for the development of Marinebiotics (20210469)’ funded by the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, Korea, and by the National Institute of Fisheries Science (R2021026).",,Scientific Reports,,Springer Nature,2045-2322,"Bacteria; Bays; Biodiversity; Eukaryota; Phylogeny; Plankton; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; RNA, Ribosomal, 18S; Republic of Korea; Seawater",2022-02-22,2022,2022-02-22,,12,1,2980,All OA; Gold,Article,"Han, Dukki; Shin, Hanseob; Lee, Ji-Hoon; Kang, Chang-Keun; Kim, Dong-Gyun; Hur, Hor-Gil","Han, Dukki (Department of Marine Molecular Bioscience, Gangneung-Wonju National University, 7, Jukheon-gil, 25457, Gangneung-si, Gangwon-do, Republic of Korea); Shin, Hanseob (School of Earth Sciences and Environmental Engineering, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, 123 Cheomdangwagi-ro, Buk-gu, 61005, Gwangju, Republic of Korea); Lee, Ji-Hoon (Department of Bioenvironmental Chemistry, Jeonbuk National University, Jeonju, Republic of Korea); Kang, Chang-Keun (School of Earth Sciences and Environmental Engineering, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, 123 Cheomdangwagi-ro, Buk-gu, 61005, Gwangju, Republic of Korea); Kim, Dong-Gyun (Biotechnology Research Division, National Institute of Fisheries Science, 46083, Busan, Republic of Korea); Hur, Hor-Gil (School of Earth Sciences and Environmental Engineering, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, 123 Cheomdangwagi-ro, Buk-gu, 61005, Gwangju, Republic of Korea)","Han, Dukki (Gangneung–Wonju National University)","Han, Dukki (Gangneung–Wonju National University); Shin, Hanseob (Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology); Lee, Ji-Hoon (Jeonbuk National University); Kang, Chang-Keun (Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology); Kim, Dong-Gyun (National Fisheries Research and Development Institute); Hur, Hor-Gil (Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology)",Gangneung–Wonju National University; National Fisheries Research and Development Institute; Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology; Jeonbuk National University,grid.411733.3; grid.419358.2; grid.61221.36; grid.411545.0,Gangneung; Busan; Gwangju; Jeonju,; ; ; ,South Korea; South Korea; South Korea; South Korea,Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries; National Fisheries Research and Development Institute; National Research Foundation of Korea,,South Korea; South Korea; South Korea,,,2,2,,,1,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06624-7.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145742459,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3107 Microbiology; 37 Earth Sciences; 3708 Oceanography,,,,,,A05 Biological Sciences; B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,14 Life Below Water

Despite the importance of biological interactions for community processes, knowledge on how species interactions are affected by a limiting resource, for example, low food availability, remains limited. Here, we tested whether variation in food supply causes nonadditive consumption patterns, using the macroinvertebrate community of intertidal sandy beaches as a model system. We quantified isotopically labeled diatom consumption by three macroinvertebrate species (Bathyporeia pilosa, Haustorius arenarius, and Scolelepis squamata) kept in mesocosms in either monoculture or a three-species community at a range of diatom densities. Our results show that B. pilosa was the most successful competitor in terms of consumption at both high and low diatom density, while H. arenarius and especially S. squamata consumed less in a community than in their respective monocultures. Nonadditive effects on consumption in this macroinvertebrate community were present and larger than mere additive effects, and similar across diatom densities. The underlying species interactions, however, did change with diatom density. Complementarity effects related to niche-partitioning were the main driver of the net diversity effect on consumption, with a slightly increasing contribution of selection effects related to competition with decreasing diatom density. For the first time, we showed that nonadditive effects of consumption are independent of food availability in a macroinvertebrate community. This suggests that, in communities with functionally different, and thus complementary, species, nonadditive effects can arise even when food availability is low. Hence, at a range of environmental conditions, species interactions hold important potential to alter ecosystem functioning.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was funded by Technology Foundation STW within the NatureCoast program (P11‐24), granted to RA (grant nr. 12689).

On coral reefs, elevated sediment deposition can be a major stressor reducing the health of corals and reef resilience. Here, we investigated the influence of severe sedimentation on the mutualistic relationship between small damselfishes (Pomacentrus moluccensis and Dascyllus aruanus) and their coral host (Pocillopora damicornis). In an aquarium experiment, corals were exposed to sedimentation rates of approximately 100 mg cm-2 d-1, with and without fishes present, to test whether: (i) fishes influence the accumulation of sediments on coral hosts, and (ii) fishes moderate partial colony mortality and/or coral tissue condition. Colonies with fishes accumulated much less sediment compared with colonies without fishes, and this effect was strongest for colonies with D. aruanus (fivefold less sediment than controls) as opposed to P. moluccensis (twofold less sediment than controls). Colonies with symbiont fishes also had up to 10-fold less sediment-induced partial mortality, as well as higher chlorophyll and protein concentrations. These results demonstrate that fish mutualisms vary in the strength of their benefits, and indicate that some mutualistic or facilitative interactions might become more important for species health and resilience at high-stress levels.","We thank the Orpheus Island Research Station staff, Dan Roberts, Molly Scott, Taylor Whitman, Alejandro Usobiaga, Allison Paley and Andrew Negri for their field support and technical assistance.",,Royal Society Open Science,,The Royal Society,2054-5703,,2020-04-29,2020,2020-04-29,2020-04,7,4,192074,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chase, T.

This is also true for parasitic species that share the same host. Microsporidia and Rickettsia are widespread intracellular parasites in populations of Paracalliope fluviatilis, the most common freshwater amphipods in New Zealand. Although both parasites coexist in many populations, it is unclear whether they interact with each other. Here, we investigated spatial−temporal dynamics and co-occurrence of the two parasites, Microsporidia and Rickettsia in P. fluviatilis hosts, across one annual cycle and in three different locations. Prevalence of both Microsporidia and Rickettsia changed over time. However, while the prevalence of Rickettsia varied significantly between sampling times, that of Microsporidia did not change significantly and remained relatively low. The two parasites therefore followed different temporal patterns. Also, the prevalence of both parasites differed among locations, though the two species reached their highest prevalence in different locations. Lastly, there was no evidence for positive or negative associations between the two parasite species; the presence of one parasite in an individual host does not appear to influence the probability of infection by the other parasite. Their respective prevalence may follow different patterns among populations on a larger spatial scale due to environmental heterogeneity across locations.",We appreciate Jean-François Doherty for assisting in fieldwork.

Locally, selection shapes community assembly through biological interactions between organisms and the environment, while regional factors influence microbial dispersion patterns. Methods used to disentangle the effects of local and regional factors typically do not aim to identify ecological processes underlying the turnover. In this paper, we identified and quantified these processes for three operational microbial subcommunities (cyanobacteria, particle-attached, and free-living bacteria) from a tropical cascade of freshwater reservoirs with decreasing productivity, over two markedly different dry and rainy seasons. We hypothesized that during the dry season communities would mainly be controlled by selection shaped by the higher environmental heterogeneity that results from low hydrological flow and connectivity between reservoirs. We expected highly similar communities shaped by dispersal and a more homogenized environment during the rainy season, enhanced by increased flow rates. Even if metacommunities were largely controlled by regional events in both periods, the selection had more influence on free-living communities during the dry period, possibly related to elevated dissolved organic carbon concentration, while drift as a purely stochastic factor, had more influence on cyanobacterial communities. Each subcommunity had distinct patterns of turnover along the cascade related to diversity (Cyanobacteria), lifestyle and size (Free-living), and spatial dynamics (particle-attached).","We thank Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa (FAPESP) for funding the project of which this study was part (grants 2011/50054-4 and 2014/14139-3).

Yet, whether predator species loss-a prevailing characteristic of the extinction crisis-will exacerbate the ecological consequences of extreme climatic events remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the loss of predator species can interact with heatwaves to moderate the compositional stability of ecosystems. We exposed multitrophic stream communities, with and without a dominant predator species, to realistic current and future heatwaves and found that heatwaves destabilised algal communities by homogenising them in space. However, this happened only when the predator was absent. Additional heatwave impacts on multiple aspects of stream communities, including changes to the structure of algal and macroinvertebrate communities, as well as total algal biomass and its temporal variability, were not apparent during heatwaves and emerged only after the heatwaves had passed. Taken together, our results suggest that the ecological consequences of heatwaves can amplify over time as their impacts propagate through biological interaction networks, but the presence of predators can help to buffer such impacts. These findings underscore the importance of conserving trophic structure, and highlight the potential for species extinctions to amplify the effects of climate change and extreme events.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank Susumu Igarashi and Tomoaki Sato for help in constructing our experimental system and for help with sample processing; Hinako Katsushima, Gen Kusakabe, Hiroyuki ‘Dani’ Matsuyama, Azusa Sekishita, Ryohei Sugime, Muku Tsujino and Saori Yoshida for help with sample processing and data collection; Junjiro Negishi, Daisetsu Ito and Janine Tolod for help during macroinvertebrate identification; Emi Yoshida and all staff members of Tomakomai Experimental Forest for additional support; and Jay Piggott and Hannah White for helpful discussion.

At the scale of these aggregates (∼100μm), interactions are likely to be the dominant driver of population structure and dynamics. In particular, organisms that exploit interspecific interactions to increase ecological performance often co-aggregate. Conversely, organisms that antagonize each other will tend to spatially segregate, creating distinct micro-communities and increased diversity at larger length scales. We argue that, in order to understand the role that biological interactions play in microbial community function, it is necessary to study microscale spatial organization with enough throughput to measure statistical associations between taxa and possible alternative community states.

Local environmental factors and dispersal-based processes can both influence the structure of metacommunities in freshwater ecosystems. Describing these patterns is especially important for biomonitoring approaches that are based on inferences made from benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages. Here, we examine the metacommunity structure of chironomid assemblages collected from 28 sampling stations along the Southern Morava River, Serbia. We examined the extent of dispersal-based processes along a temporal scale. We obtained 8 models for the different sampling seasons that determined the spatial variables that best explained variability in chironomid assemblages. Spatial processes were found to be a significant predictor of variation for chironomids during the late winter/spring (March and May) and autumn (October and November), concordant with the known phenology of common taxa. Species sorting and mass effects were found to be significant processes that structured the chironomid metacommunity. In addition, biological interactions, inferred from fish biomass, and habitat traits, demonstrated by macrophyte and riparian vegetation, were found to influence species sorting. A high variability of chironomid metacommunity structure across sampling seasons suggests that monitoring programs that include macroinvertebrates in bioassessment should avoid months with pronounced spatial processes, and consequently maximize a correlation between community structure and local environmental factors.","This work was supported by grants 451-03-9/2021-14/200124 by the Serbian Ministry of Education and Science.

These microbes modify nectar chemistry, often altering mutualistic relationships between plants and pollinators in ways that we are only beginning to understand. Many studies on this multi-partite system have focused on either yeasts or bacteria without consideration of yeast-bacterium interactions, but recent evidence suggests that such interactions drive the assembly of nectar microbial communities and its consequences for pollination. Unexplored potential mechanisms of yeast-bacterium interactions include the formation of physical complexes, nutritional interactions, antibiosis, signaling-based interactions, and horizontal gene transfer. We argue that studying these mechanisms can elucidate how nectar microbial communities are established and affect plant fitness via pollinators.","S.A-P. acknowledges funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant 742964.

Here, we discuss the potential coevolutionary interdependence of the strength and specificity of symbiotic interactions with the complexity and productivity of their environment. We predict that interactions become less beneficial with increasing environmental quality and that the association of productivity with symbiont specificity depends on the relative strengths of tradeoffs between host range and other life-history parameters. However, as biotic complexity increases, pathogen specificity is predicted to decline, whereas mutualist specificity will increase. Testing these predictions on a geographical scale would contribute significantly to the predictive science of coevolution, and to our ability to manage biological interactions embedded in increasingly fragmented landscapes.",We thank the French programmes ‘Microbiologie’ et ‘Risques OGM’ (to M.E.H.) and NSF DEB-0049080 (to J.D.B) for supporting this research.

Here, we investigate the pelagic tunicate Pyrosoma atlanticum in the waters surrounding the Cabo Verde Archipelago. By using a combination of pelagic and benthic in situ observations, sampling, and molecular genetic analyses (barcoding, eDNA), we reveal that: P. atlanticum abundance is most likely driven by local island-induced productivity, that it substantially contributes to the organic carbon export flux and is part of a diverse range of biological interactions. Downward migrating pyrosomes actively transported an estimated 13% of their fecal pellets below the mixed layer, equaling a carbon flux of 1.96–64.55 mg C m−2 day−1. We show that analysis of eDNA can detect pyrosome material beyond their migration range, suggesting that pyrosomes have ecological impacts below the upper water column. Moribund P. atlanticum colonies contributed an average of 15.09 ± 17.89 (s.d.) mg C m−2 to the carbon flux reaching the island benthic slopes. Our pelagic in situ observations further show that P. atlanticum formed an abundant substrate in the water column (reaching up to 0.28 m2 substrate area per m2), with animals using pyrosomes for settlement, as a shelter and/or a food source. In total, twelve taxa from four phyla were observed to interact with pyrosomes in the midwater and on the benthos.","We are grateful to the crew of R/V Poseidon and the JAGO team for their support during the cruises and would like to thank Hendrik Hampe and Eduard Fabrizius for their help before and during the cruises.

The nitrogen assimilation efficiency of mycorrhized plants was determined by measuring the activities of nitrate reductase assimilatory and glutamine synthetase enzymes and free amino acid patterns. Mycorrhizal plants at two different sites showed an assimilative activity of nitrate and ammonium approximately 30% greater than control plants. This activity was associated with significant increases in the amino acids Arg, Glu Gln and Orn in the roots where those amino acids are part of the inorganic nitrogen assimilation of mycorrhizal fungi. The nutrient supply of mycorrhizal fungi at the root guaranteed the increased growth of the plant that was about 40% greater in fresh weight and 25% greater in productive yield than the controls. To better understand the biological interaction between plant and fungus, microbiological screening was carried out to identify colonies of radicular endophytic fungi. Fourteen fungal strains belonging to nine different species were classified. Among pathogenic fungi, the genus Fusarium was present in all the examined roots with different frequencies, depending on the site and the fungal population present in the roots, providing useful clues regarding the principle of spatial conflict and fungal spread within the root system.",,,Plants,,MDPI,2223-7747,,2022-03-29,2022,2022-03-29,,11,7,924,All OA; Gold,Article,"Di Martino, Catello; Torino, Valentina; Minotti, Pasqualino; Pietrantonio, Laura; Del Grosso, Carmine; Palmieri, Davide; Palumbo, Giuseppe; Crawford, Thomas W.; Carfagna, Simona","Di Martino, Catello (Department of Agriculture, Environmental and Food Sciences, University of Molise, Via De Sanctis, 86100 Campobasso, Italy;, v.torino@studenti.unimol.it, (V.T.);, minottipasqualino@gmail.com, (P.M.);, c.delgrosso2@studenti.unimol.it, (C.D.G.);, davide.palmieri@unimol.it, (D.P.);, palumbo@unimol.it, (G.P.)); Torino, Valentina (Department of Agriculture, Environmental and Food Sciences, University of Molise, Via De Sanctis, 86100 Campobasso, Italy;, v.torino@studenti.unimol.it, (V.T.);, minottipasqualino@gmail.com, (P.M.);, c.delgrosso2@studenti.unimol.it, (C.D.G.);, davide.palmieri@unimol.it, (D.P.);, palumbo@unimol.it, (G.P.)); Minotti, Pasqualino (Department of Agriculture, Environmental and Food Sciences, University of Molise, Via De Sanctis, 86100 Campobasso, Italy;, v.torino@studenti.unimol.it, (V.T.);, minottipasqualino@gmail.com, (P.M.);, c.delgrosso2@studenti.unimol.it, (C.D.G.);, davide.palmieri@unimol.it, (D.P.);, palumbo@unimol.it, (G.P.)); Pietrantonio, Laura (MS Biotech SpA, c.da Piane di Larino, 35, 86035 Larino, Italy;, laura.pietrantonio@msbiotech.net); Del Grosso, Carmine (Department of Agriculture, Environmental and Food Sciences, University of Molise, Via De Sanctis, 86100 Campobasso, Italy;, v.torino@studenti.unimol.it, (V.T.);, minottipasqualino@gmail.com, (P.M.);, c.delgrosso2@studenti.unimol.it, (C.D.G.);, davide.palmieri@unimol.it, (D.P.);, palumbo@unimol.it, (G.P.)); Palmieri, Davide (Department of Agriculture, Environmental and Food Sciences, University of Molise, Via De Sanctis, 86100 Campobasso, Italy;, v.torino@studenti.unimol.it, (V.T.);, minottipasqualino@gmail.com, (P.M.);, c.delgrosso2@studenti.unimol.it, (C.D.G.);, davide.palmieri@unimol.it, (D.P.);, palumbo@unimol.it, (G.P.)); Palumbo, Giuseppe (Department of Agriculture, Environmental and Food Sciences, University of Molise, Via De Sanctis, 86100 Campobasso, Italy;, v.torino@studenti.unimol.it, (V.T.);, minottipasqualino@gmail.com, (P.M.);, c.delgrosso2@studenti.unimol.it, (C.D.G.);, davide.palmieri@unimol.it, (D.P.);, palumbo@unimol.it, (G.P.)); Crawford, Thomas W.

So far, efforts to ameliorate Earth's ecosystem crises have been insufficient, as these often depart from current knowledge of the underlying ecological processes. Nowadays, biodiversity loss and the alterations in biogeochemical cycles are reaching thresholds that put the survival of our species at risk. Biological interactions are fundamental for achieving biological conservation and restoration of ecological processes, especially those that contribute to nutrient cycles. Microorganism are recognized as key players in ecological interactions and nutrient cycling, both free-living and in symbiotic associations with multicellular organisms. This latter assemblage work as a functional ecological unit called ""holobiont."" Here, we review the emergent ecosystem properties derived from holobionts, with special emphasis on detritivorous terrestrial arthropods and their symbiotic microorganisms. We revisit their relevance in the cycling of recalcitrant organic compounds (e.g., lignin and cellulose). Finally, based on the interconnection between biodiversity and nutrient cycling, we propose that a multicellular organism and its associates constitute an Ecosystem Holobiont (EH). This EH is the functional unit characterized by carrying out key ecosystem processes. We emphasize that in order to meet the challenge to restore the health of our planet it is critical to reduce anthropic pressures that may threaten not only individual entities (known as ""bionts"") but also the stability of the associations that give rise to EH and their ecological functions.","We would like to thank Profs.

By conducting aquarium experiments, the habitat occupancy of P. fluviatilis was documented in the presence and absence of a predator (pike Esox lucius; size: 25.4 ± 2.1 cm) and a potential competitor (ruffe Gymnocephalus cernuus; size: 14.1 ± 0.3 cm) fish species. Two P. fluviatilis individuals generally shared the same habitat. In the presence of a conspecific, P. fluviatilis favoured the structurally more-complex, artificial macrophyte habitat over the less-structured rock and sand habitat, which in turn were used equally. In the predator- and competitor treatments, P. fluviatilis seemed to adapt their habitat use to the habitat occupancy of E. lucius and G. cernuus in the Macrophyte vs. Rock and, in the predator treatment, also in the Macrophyte vs. Sand habitat combination, by increasingly occupying a habitat that was used less by the predator or competitor species, respectively. This behaviour suggests that P. fluviatilis tried to avoid the other fish species by choosing a, in some cases less preferred, predator- or competitor-free habitat. This study emphasizes the importance of biological interactions illustrated by the potential of predation risk and competition to structure fish communities by influencing habitat use at small spatial scales.","We thank Husö Biological Station, Åbo Akademi University, for providing excellent aquaria facilities.

In mesic regions, biocrusts emerge rapidly on disturbed surface soil in forest, typically after clear-cut or windfall. It is unclear whether the bacterial community in biocrusts is similar to the community of the surrounding soil or if biocrust formation promotes a specific bacterial community. Also, many of the interactions between bacteria and algae in biocrusts are largely unknown. Through high-throughput-sequencing analysis of the bacterial community composition, correlated drivers, and the interpretation of biological interactions in a biocrust of a forest ecosystem, we show that the bacterial community in the biocrust represents a subset of the community of the neighboring soil. Bacterial families connected with degradation of large carbon molecules, like cellulose and chitin, and the bacterivore Bdellovibrio were more abundant in the biocrust compared to bulk soil. This points to a closer interaction and nutrient recycling in the biocrust compared to bulk soil. Furthermore, the bacterial richness was positively correlated with the content of mucilage producing algae. The bacteria likely profit from the mucilage sheaths of the algae, either as a carbon source or protectant from grazing or desiccation. Comparative sequence analyses revealed pronounced differences between the biocrust bacterial microbiome. It seems that the bacterial community of the biocrust is recruited from the local soil, resulting in specific bacterial communities in different geographic regions.","We would like to thank Andre Acksel and Elena Heilmann for help during biocrust sampling and analyses.

Specifically, the extent to which more closely related organisms share similar ecological preferences due to phylogenetic conservation - or if they are forced apart by competition - is still debated. Here, we explored the co-occurrence patterns of freshwater cyanobacteria at the sub-genus level to investigate whether more closely related taxa share more similar niches and to what extent these niches were defined by abiotic or biotic variables. We used deep 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and measured several abiotic environmental parameters (nutrients, temperature, etc.) in water samples collected over time and space in Furnas Reservoir, Brazil. We found that relatively more closely related Synechococcus (in the continuous range of 93%-100% nucleotide identity in 16S) had an increased tendency to co-occur with one another (i.e. had similar realized niches). This tendency could not be easily explained by shared preferences for measured abiotic niche dimensions. Thus, commonly measured abiotic parameters might not be sufficient to characterize, nor to predict community assembly or dynamics. Rather, co-occurrence between Synechococcus and the surrounding community (whether or not they represent true biological interactions) may be a more sensitive measure of realized niches. Overall, our results suggest that realized niches are phylogenetically conserved, at least at the sub-genus level and at the resolution of the 16S marker. Determining how these results generalize to other genera and at finer genetic resolution merits further investigation.",NT is funded by a project from the European Union&#x27;s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska‐Curie grant agreement No 656647.

However, details of the paleoecology and paleoenvironment of rich brachiopod fauna in this area are still unclear, especially regarding the reef-dwelling brachiopods. The reef-dwelling brachiopod specimens from the Panlongdong platform-margin reefal environment are first described herein. A detailed comparison is presented with the paleoecological features and sedimentological characteristics of the reef-dwelling brachiopods and brachiopods of the reported Zhongliang Hill and Huayingshan intraplatform nonreefal environments in the transitional zone. The reef-dwelling brachiopods are dominated by the spiriferids, such as Martinia and Permophricodothyris, which are mainly found in hypercalcified sponge-calcareous algae binding framestone from the second reef-building process of the Panlongdong reef. The brachiopods in the first and third reef-building processes of the Panlongdong reef often show clear indications of transportation. The comparison of paleoecological and sedimentological evidence indicates that the reef-dwelling brachiopod specimens, which have strong pedicle-attached convex shells and supporting body spines, are commonly preserved in live positions and form a hard-bottom fauna, showing low evenness, and high dominance in both taxonomical and lifestyle diversity. The association among reef-dwelling brachiopod individuals also represents potential biological interactions to prevent the shells from being swept away by constant currents and waves, forming extremely dense concentrations on the sea floor as reef ecosystem engineers. This case study of reef-dwelling brachiopods preserved within the platform-margin reefal environment was critical for filling various gaps in our knowledge of the complexity of the Changhsingian reef-related ecosystem.","The authors want to thank Editor‐in‐Chief Dr. Heather F.

In recent years, several researchers have studied the diversity and function of the epiphytic bacteria associated with algal host, but largely these interactions remain underexplored. In the present study we analysed the cultivable diversity and polymer degradation potential of epiphytic bacteria associated with five different marine macroalgae (Sargassum, Ulva, Padina, Dictyota and Pterocladia sp.) sampled from the central west coast of India. Out of the total 360 strains isolated, purified and preserved, about 238 strains were identified through 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and processed for polymer (cellulose, pectin, xylan and starch) degrading activities. Phylogeny placed the strains within the classes Actinobacteria, Bacilli, Alpha-proteobacteria, and Gamma-proteobacteria and clustered them into 45 genera, wherein Vibrio, Bacillus, Pseudoalteromonas, Alteromonas, Staphylococcus and Kocuria spp. were the most abundant with 20 strains identified as potentially novel taxa within the genera Bacillus, Cellulosimicrobium, Gordonia, Marinomonas, Vibrio, Luteimonas and Pseudoalteromonas. In terms of polymer hydrolysis potential, 61.3% had xylanase activity, while 59.7%, 58.8%, and 52.2% had amylase, cellulase, and pectinase activity, respectively. Overall, 75.6% of the strains degraded more than one polysaccharide, 24% degraded all polymers, while nine strains (3.8%) degraded raw sugarcane bagasse.

METHODS: Here, we analyzed the genetic diversity and structure of a host, the blue swimming crab, Portunus pelagicus, and its symbiotic pedunculate barnacle Octolasmis angulata from six location sites representing three geographic regions (north, central and south) along the Vietnam coastline. High levels of congruence in their phylogeographic patterns were expected as they both undergo planktonic larval stages.
RESULTS: Based on the COI mtDNA markers, O. angulata populations showed higher genetic diversity in comparison with their host P. pelagicus (number of haplotype/individuals, haplotype and nucleotide diversity are 119/192, 0.991 ± 0.002 and 0.02; and 89/160, 0.913 ± 0.02 and 0.015, respectively). Pairwise Fst and AMOVA analyses showed a more pronounced population structure in the symbiotic barnacle than in its crab host. The DAPC analyses identified three genetic clusters. However, both haplotype networks and scatter plots supported connectivity of the host and the symbiotic barnacle throughout their distribution range, except for low subdivision of southern population. Isolation by distance were detected only for the symbiont O. angulata (R2 = 0.332, P = 0.05), while dbMEM supported spatial structure of both partners, but only at MEM-1 (Obs. 0.2686, P < 0.01 and Obs. 0.2096, P < 0.01, respectively).","This project was funded by NORHED under the framework of research project QZA-0485 SRV-13/0010 titled “Incorporating Climate Change into Ecosystem Approaches to Fisheries and Aquaculture Management in Sri Lanka and Vietnam”.

Despite the high-growth emerging health-hazard microplastic additive type of contaminants, its biological interactions with coral-algal symbiosis and/or its synergistic effects linked to solar-bleaching events remain unknown. This study investigated the bioaccumulation patterns of polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) and phthalate ester (PAE) pollutants in six genera of living/bleached corals in Larak Island, Persian Gulf, and their ambient abiotic matrixes. Results showed that the levels of ∑18PBDEs and ∑13PAEs in abiotic matrixes followed the order of SPMs > surface sediments > seawater, and the cnidarian POP-uptake patterns (soft corals > hard corals) were as follows: coral mucus (138.49 ± 59.98 and 71.57 ± 47.39 ng g-1 dw) > zooxanthellae (82.05 ± 28.27 and 20.14 ± 12.65 ng g-1 dw) ≥ coral tissue (66.26 ± 21.42 and 34.97 ± 26.10 ng g-1 dw) > bleached corals (45.19 ± 8.73 and 13.83 ± 7.05 ng g-1 dw) > coral skeleton (35.66 ± 9.58 and 6.47 ± 6.47 ng g-1 dw, respectively). Overall, findings suggest that mucus checking is a key/facile diagnostic approach for fast detection of POP bioaccumulation (PB) in tropical corals. Although studied corals exhibited no consensus concerning hazardous levels of PB (log BSAF < 3.7), our bleaching evidence showed soft corals as the ultimate ""summer winners"" due to their flexibility/recovering ability.","This investigation was supported by the Academy of Environment Science, Tarbiat Modares University in Tehran, Iran.",,Environmental Science and Technology,,American Chemical Society (ACS),"0013-936X, 1520-5851",Animals; Anthozoa; Coral Reefs; Flame Retardants; Indian Ocean; Islands; Phthalic Acids; Plastics; Symbiosis,2021-04-22,2021,2021-04-22,2021-05-04,55,9,5970-5983,Closed,Article,"Jafarabadi, Ali Ranjbar; Mashjoor, Sakineh; Bakhtiari, Alireza Riyahi; Cappello, Tiziana","Jafarabadi, Ali Ranjbar (Department of Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Natural Resources and Marine Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Noor, Mazandaran, Iran); Mashjoor, Sakineh (Marine Pharmaceutical Science Research Center, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran); Bakhtiari, Alireza Riyahi (Department of Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Natural Resources and Marine Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Noor, Mazandaran, Iran); Cappello, Tiziana (Department of Chemical, Biological, Pharmaceutical, and Environmental Sciences, University of Messina, Messina, Italy)","Bakhtiari, Alireza Riyahi (Tarbiat Modares University)","Jafarabadi, Ali Ranjbar (Tarbiat Modares University); Mashjoor, Sakineh (Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences); Bakhtiari, Alireza Riyahi (Tarbiat Modares University); Cappello, Tiziana (University of Messina)",Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences; University of Messina; Tarbiat Modares University,grid.411230.5; grid.10438.3e; grid.412266.5,Ahvāz; Messina; Tehran,; ; ,Iran; Italy; Iran,,,,,,11,11,2.44,4.41,1,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137396262,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management; 4105 Pollution and Contamination,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,14 Life Below Water

Biocrusts are particularly common in drylands and are found in arid and semiarid ecosystems worldwide. While diminutive in size, biocrusts often cover large terrestrial areas, provide numerous ecosystem benefits, enhance biodiversity, and are found in multiple configurations and assemblages across different climate and disturbance regimes. Biocrusts have been a focus of many ecologists, especially those working in semiarid and arid lands, as biocrusts are foundational community members, play fundamental roles in ecosystem processes, and offer rare opportunities to study biological interactions at small and large spatial scales. Due to these same characteristics, biocrusts have the potential to serve as an excellent teaching tool. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the utility of biocrust communities as a model system in science education. Functioning as portable, dynamic mini ecosystems, biocrusts can be used to teach about organisms, biodiversity, biotic interactions, abiotic controls, ecosystem processes, and even global change, and can be easy to use in nearly every classroom setup. For example, education principles, such as evolution and adaptation to stress, or structure and function (patterns and processes) can be applied by bringing biocrusts into the classroom as a teaching tool. In addition, discussing the utility of biocrusts in the classroom - including theory, hypothesis testing, experimentation, and hands-on learning - this document also provides tips and resources for developing education tools and activities geared toward impactful learning.",,"Funding.

2757,pub.1149844785,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157697,35914595,,,Plastic microbiome development in a freshwater ecosystem,"To understand biological interactions of plastic litter in freshwater ecosystems, as well the potential effects of plastics on ecosystem processes, studies of the activity and composition of plastic-associated microbial communities are needed. The physical properties and chemical composition of plastic polymers are key components of plastic product design, and may also select for distinct microbial biofilms colonizing plastic litter. We monitored growth and succession of biofilm communities on plastic substrates of common morphotypes (i.e., hard, soft, foam, and film) and a natural surface (i.e., an unglazed ceramic tile) incubated in an urban stream. We measured biofilm biomass, metabolism, extracellular enzyme activity, and bacterial, fungal and algal community composition over four weeks during primary succession. Results demonstrated a general increase in biofilm biomass and enzymatic activity corresponding to carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism during biofilm development for all substrate types. We observed higher respiration rates and negative net ecosystem productivity on foam and tile surfaces in comparison to hard, soft and film plastic surfaces. Biofilm bacterial, fungal and algal assemblages showed few significant differences in composition among substrates. However, all microbial communities changed significantly in composition over time. While substrate type was not the major factor driving biofilm composition and activity, these data show plastic litter in streams is well colonized by an active and dynamic biofilm community. As plastic litter is increasing across all types of aquatic ecosystems, it should be considered a medium for biologically active organisms that contribute to key ecosystem processes.","This research was funded by the National Science Foundation grant to T.

This invasive species has been reported from multiple tropical and subtropical countries in five continents, most of which were colonized in recent times. In order to understand how the realized niche of the species was affected by this dramatic geographic range expansion, we reconstructed the history of the geographic range expansion. We built models of the realized niche of the species at different points in time during the invasion process. This was achieved through the implementation of modern hypervolume construction methods, based on the Hutchinson's niche concept. The models were then compared to detect possible realized climatic niche expansion over time. Furthermore, we investigated possible pathways used by the species to spread. A progressive expansion of the realized niche was identified. As the species spread into new areas, we observed a tendency to colonize regions with warmer temperatures and higher precipitation rates. Finally, we found evidence for cargo shipping being the major pathway through which the species expands its range. Further studies on this topic should aim to investigate the role of biological interactions, and how they shape the distribution of L. lugubris on a global scale. A deeper understanding of this kind of processes will help us tackle the issue of invasive species, which has become a major challenge in conservation biology.",The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Public Library of Science (PLoS),1932-6203,"Africa; Animal Distribution; Animals; Asia; Female; Human Activities; Introduced Species; Latin America; Lizards; Male; Models, Statistical; Parthenogenesis; Population Dynamics; Rain; Temperature; Transportation",2020-07-06,2020,2020-07-06,,15,7,e0235060,All OA; Gold,Article,"Nania, Dario; Flecks, Morris; Rödder, Dennis","Nania, Dario (Zoologisches Forschungsmuseum Alexander Koenig, Bonn, Germany; Department of Biology and Biotechnology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy); Flecks, Morris (Zoologisches Forschungsmuseum Alexander Koenig, Bonn, Germany); Rödder, Dennis (Zoologisches Forschungsmuseum Alexander Koenig, Bonn, Germany)","Nania, Dario (Zoological Research Museum Alexander Koenig; Sapienza University of Rome); Rödder, Dennis (Zoological Research Museum Alexander Koenig)","Nania, Dario (Zoological Research Museum Alexander Koenig; Sapienza University of Rome); Flecks, Morris (Zoological Research Museum Alexander Koenig); Rödder, Dennis (Zoological Research Museum Alexander Koenig)",Zoological Research Museum Alexander Koenig; Sapienza University of Rome,grid.452935.c; grid.7841.a,Bonn; Rome,; Lazio,Germany; Italy,,,,,,10,10,0.54,3.17,5,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0235060&type=printable,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129026453,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,

Here, we expand the network paradigm to consider that nodes can be embedded within other nodes, and connections (edges) between nodes at one level of organization form ""bridges"" for connections between nodes embedded within them. Such hierarchically embedded networks highlight two central properties of biological systems: 1) processes occurring across multiple levels of organization shape connections among biological units at any given level of organization and 2) ecological effects occurring at a given level of organization can propagate up or down to additional levels. Explicitly considering the embedded structure of evolutionary and ecological networks can capture otherwise hidden feedbacks and generate new insights into key biological phenomena, ultimately promoting a broader understanding of interactions in evolutionary theory.",,,Behavioral Ecology,,Oxford University Press (OUP),"1045-2249, 1465-7279",,2019-10-11,2019,2019-10-11,2020-03-20,31,2,279-286,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Montiglio, P O; Gotanda, K M; Kratochwil, C F; Laskowski, K L; Farine, D R","Montiglio, P O (Département des Sciences Biologiques, Université du Québec à Montréal, Succursale Centre-ville, Montréal, Québec, Canada); Gotanda, K M (Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK); Kratochwil, C F (Chair in Zoology and Evolutionary Biology, Department of Biology, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany; Zukunftskolleg, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany); Laskowski, K L (Department of Biology, & Ecology of Fishes, Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology & Inland Fisheries, Berlin, Germany; Department of Evolution and Ecology, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA); Farine, D R (Department of Collective Behavior, Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, Universitätsstraße 10, Konstanz, Germany; Department of Biology, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany; Centre for the Advanced Study of Collective Behaviour, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany; Edward Grey Institute of Ornithology, Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK)","Montiglio, P O (University of Quebec at Montreal); Farine, D R (Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior; University of Konstanz; Cluster of Excellence ""Centre for the Advanced Study of Collective Behaviour""; University of Oxford)","Montiglio, P O (University of Quebec at Montreal); Gotanda, K M (University of Cambridge); Kratochwil, C F (University of Konstanz; University of Konstanz); Laskowski, K L (Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries; University of California, Davis); Farine, D R (Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior; University of Konstanz; Cluster of Excellence ""Centre for the Advanced Study of Collective Behaviour""; University of Oxford)","Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries; Cluster of Excellence ""Centre for the Advanced Study of Collective Behaviour""; University of Cambridge; University of Oxford; University of Quebec at Montreal; University of Konstanz; University of California, Davis; Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior",grid.419247.d; grid.517314.5; grid.5335.0; grid.4991.5; grid.38678.32; grid.9811.1; grid.27860.3b; grid.507516.0,Berlin; Konstanz; Cambridge; Oxford; Montreal; Konstanz; Davis; Radolfzell,; ; ; Oxfordshire; Quebec; Baden-Württemberg; California; ,Germany; Germany; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; Canada; Germany; United States; Germany,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,,Germany,,,8,6,0.52,1.93,19,https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article-pdf/31/2/279/32957288/arz168.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120700696,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,B11 Computer Science and Informatics,

This review describes the relationships between methylotrophs and plants, and between methanotrophs (methane-utilizers, a subset of methylotrophs) and heterotrophic bacteria. Some plants emit methane and methanol from their leaves, and provide methylotrophs with habitats. Methanol-utilizing methylotrophs in the genus Methylobacterium are abundant in the phyllosphere and have the ability to promote the growth of some plants. Methanotrophs also inhabit the phyllosphere, and methanotrophs with high methane oxidation activities have been found on aquatic plants. Both plant and environmental factors are involved in shaping the methylotroph community on plants. Methanotrophic activity can be enhanced by heterotrophic bacteria that provide growth factors (e.g., cobalamin). Information regarding the biological interaction of methylotrophs with other organisms will facilitate a better understanding of the carbon cycle that is driven by methylotrophs.",This paper was supported in part by grants-in-aid for scientific research (B) (25281063 to H.Y.) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.

Yet there are several lines of evidence to suggest that intrinsic biological dynamics can produce pattern even in an ecosystem that is homogeneous for the organisms involved. Outside of the laboratory, it is difficult to convincingly demonstrate large-scale pattern formation from biological interactions, mainly because it is close to impossible to exclude habitat variables. Vandermeer et al. have used the artificiality of shade trees planted in a coffee plantation to get around this problem, and demonstrate significant patterning of a particular species of ant, Azteca instabilis, that nests in those trees. Ant population density is controlled by natural enemies, mainly a parasitic fly, but the distribution of ant nest clusters follows a strong spatial pattern despite habitat homogeneity.","We thank S.

This observation calls into question the often-held view that nonsymbiotic corals are restricted to cryptic environments because of their inability to compete successfully for space with rapidly growing symbiotic corals. In this study, we investigated aspects of the biology of Tubastraea that might account for its coexistence and persistence on the reef. Our results indicate that despite low calcification rates, linear skeletal extension for Tubastraea is surprisingly rapid for a nonsymbiotic species and comparable to those of many symbiotic corals. This factor, coupled with Tubastraea's resistance to direct competitive dominance (i.e., by aggressive interactions) and avoidance of predation, promotes its coexistence with symbiotic species. The relative importance of these biological interactions in different coral communities leads to predictions corroborated by observed patterns of local distribution and abundance.",,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,"0027-8424, 1091-6490",,1985-04,1985,1985-04,1985-04,82,8,2432-2436,All OA; Green,Article,"Wellington, G.M.; Trench, Robert K.","Wellington, G.M.

However, recent theoretical work suggests that some types of variance in interaction strength may actually promote stability. Here we provide the first empirical evidence that highly variable, context-dependent species interaction strengths and resilient community patterns can be two sides of the same coin. Field experiments show that a persistent rocky intertidal seascape is remarkably resilient to multiple sources of environmental stochasticity largely because of scale dependent and variable species interaction strengths. Biological interactions exert a stabilizing effect because their intensity varies systematically with changes in both physical sources of mortality of established species, as well as recruitment of new individuals. Strong variation in species interaction strengths with disturbance size and environmental conditions is ubiquitous in nature. Elucidating when this context dependency will be stabilizing is critical to predict community-level responses to anthropogenic disturbances.","We are in debt to a number of friends who helped us in different aspects of this project, including B.

The variables studied included a number of soil properties, bacteria, protozoan flagellates, ciliates and amoebae, microbial and plant feeding nematodes, various microarthropods, and two fungal biomarkers--glomalin and ergosterol. One way ANOVA showed that the dynamics of the microbiota studied was influenced by seasonal changes. Superimposed on these changes, however, was variability due to biological interactions and habitat characteristics. Two fungal biomarkers, ergosterol and glomalin, were differently influenced by other biota and abiotic variables.

The microbial inhabitants of these biofilms (a) have adapted to all types of terrestrial/subaerial stresses (e.g., desiccation, extreme temperatures, low nutrient availability, intense solar radiation), (b) interact with minerals that serve as both a dwelling and a source of mineral nutrients, and (c) provoke weathering of rocks and soil formation. Subaerial communities comprise heterotrophic and phototrophic microorganisms that support each other's lifestyle. Major lineages of eubacteria associated with the early colonization of land (e.g., Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria) are present in these habitats along with eukaryotes such as microscopic green algae and ascomycetous fungi. The subaerial biofilm inhabitants have adapted to desiccation, solar radiation, and other environmental challenges by developing protective, melanized cell walls, assuming microcolonial architectures and symbiotic lifestyles. How these changes occurred, their significance in soil formation, and their potential as markers of climate change are discussed below.","This work was supported by a Feodor-Lynen Scholarship of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation to AAG, as well as by grants from the Swiss National Science Foundation (no. 3100AO_116858/1, IZK0A0-119407, and 3100AO-122513/1).

The community composition did not differ significantly between stainless steel and polystyrene substrata due to dominance by Navicula spp. The experimental evidence suggests that Amphora, which is a dominant fouling diatom in temperate waters, ultimately dominates the community in tropical regions when conditions are favourable. These observations reveal that a faster onset of macrofouling interferes with the microfouling community wherein the faster recruiters that have a higher abundance in ambient waters, dominate the community. Seasonal variations were observed in the fouling diatom community. Navicula delicatula dominated during the post-monsoon and tychopelagic diatoms (Melosira and Odontella) were observed during the monsoon.

Clades begin small and undifferentiated, then expand to a peak in diversity and range, only to shift into a rarely broken decline towards extinction. While this trajectory is now well documented and broadly recognised, the reasons underlying it remain obscure. In particular, it is unknown why clade extinction is universal and occurs with such surprising regularity. Current explanations for paleontological extinctions call on the growing costs of biological interactions, geological accidents, evolutionary traps, and mass extinctions. While these are effective causes of extinction, they mainly apply to species, not clades. Although mass extinctions is the undeniable cause for the demise of a sizeable number of major taxa, we show here that clades escaping them go extinct because of the widespread tendency of evolution to produce increasingly specialised, sympatric, and geographically restricted species over time.",F.C. is funded under the STAR (stranded on the right beach) project.

To test this 'law of constant extinction', we developed a new method using deep learning to infer age-dependent extinction and analysed 450 myr of marine life across 21 invertebrate clades. We show that extinction rate significantly decreases with age in > 90% of the cases, indicating that most species died out soon after their appearance while those which survived experienced ever decreasing extinction risk. This age-dependent extinction pattern is stronger towards the Equator and holds true when the potential effects of mass extinctions and taxonomic inflation are accounted for. These results suggest that the effect of biological interactions on age-dependent extinction rate is more intense towards the tropics. We propose that the latitudinal diversity gradient and selection at the species level account for this exceptional, yet little recognised, macroevolutionary and macroecological pattern.","We are grateful to P.

2655,pub.1045049188,10.1016/j.cub.2015.08.024,26412132,,,Unexpected Levels of Biological Activity during the Polar Night Offer New Perspectives on a Warming Arctic,"The current understanding of Arctic ecosystems is deeply rooted in the classical view of a bottom-up controlled system with strong physical forcing and seasonality in primary-production regimes. Consequently, the Arctic polar night is commonly disregarded as a time of year when biological activities are reduced to a minimum due to a reduced food supply. Here, based upon a multidisciplinary ecosystem-scale study from the polar night at 79°N, we present an entirely different view. Instead of an ecosystem that has entered a resting state, we document a system with high activity levels and biological interactions across most trophic levels. In some habitats, biological diversity and presence of juvenile stages were elevated in winter months compared to the more productive and sunlit periods. Ultimately, our results suggest a different perspective regarding ecosystem function that will be of importance for future environmental management and decision making, especially at a time when Arctic regions are experiencing accelerated environmental change [1].","This study is a contribution to the Norwegian Research Council (NRC) funded projects Circa (NRC 214271) and Marine Night (NRC 226417).

Despite extensive research, the outbreak mechanisms have not been fully understood. Comprehensive analysis of anthropogenic and natural biotic and abiotic factors reveals that human activities, regional physicochemical conditions and algal physiological characteristics as well as ocean warming and biological interactions (with microorganism or other macroalgae) are closely related to the occurrence of green tides. Dynamics of these factors and their interactions could explain why green tides suddenly occurred in 2007 and decreased abruptly in 2017. Moreover, the consequence of green tides is serious. The decay of macroalgal biomass could result in hypoxia and acidification, possibly induce red tide and even have a long-lasting impact on coastal carbon cycles and the ecosystem.

Coupling energy requirements with estimates of arthropod availability implies that bird demands on the insect standing crop never exceeded 0.7% per day of that standing crop during the breeding season or summer.Overall, the bioenergetic estimates imply that these birds are unlikely to be important in ecosystem processes and, reciprocally, are unlikely to be limited by food resources even during peak energy demands. As a consequence, I suggest that biological interactions such as competition play a relatively minor role in structuring the bird community in this variable environment.",,,Oecologia,,Springer Nature,"0029-8549, 1432-1939",,1980-07,1980,,1980-07,46,1,7-12,Closed,Article,"Rotenberry, John T.","Rotenberry, John T.

Pathogen-suppressive bacteria and plant beneficial protists are important components of soil microbiomes and essential to plant health and performance, but it remains largely unknown regarding how agricultural management practices influence the relative importance of protists and bacteria in plant disease suppression. Here, we characterized soil microbiomes (including fungi, protists, and bacteria) in bulk and sorghum rhizosphere soils with various long-term inorganic and organic fertilization regimes, and linked the changes in fungal plant pathogens with the protistan and bacterial communities. We found that the relative abundances of fungal pathogens were significantly decreased by organic fertilization regimes, and there was a significant difference in the community composition of fungal pathogens between inorganic and organic fertilization regimes. Organic fertilization significantly enhanced predatory protists but reduced the proportions of protistan phototrophs. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed more intensive connections between fungal plant pathogens with protists, especially predatory protists, than with bacterial taxa, which was further supported by stronger associations between the community structure of fungal pathogens and predatory protists. We identified more protist consumer taxa than bacterial taxa as predictors of fungal plant pathogens, and structural equation modelling revealed a more important impact of protist consumers than bacteria on fungal pathogens. Altogether, we provide new evidence that the disease inhibitory effects of long-term organic fertilization regimes could be best explained by the potential predation pressure of protists. Our findings advance the mechanistic understanding of the role of predator-prey interactions in controlling fungal diseases, and have implications for novel biocontrol strategies to mitigate the consequences of fungal infections for plant performance.",This study was financially supported by the Natural National Science Foundation of China (No. 31901291) and the China Agriculture Research System (No. CARS-06-13.5-A20).,,The Science of The Total Environment,,Elsevier,"0048-9697, 1879-1026",Animals; Soil; Predatory Behavior; Soil Microbiology; Eukaryota; Bacteria; Fertilization,2022-12-16,2022,2022-12-16,2023-03,863,,160986,Closed,Article,"Ren, Peixin; Sun, Anqi; Jiao, Xiaoyan; Shen, Ju-Pei; Yu, Dan-Ting; Li, Fangfang; Wu, Bingxue; He, Ji-Zheng; Hu, Hang-Wei","Ren, Peixin (Key Laboratory for Humid Subtropical Eco-geographical Processes of the Ministry of Education, School of Geographical Sciences, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, China.); Sun, Anqi (Key Laboratory of Urban Environment and Health, Ningbo Urban Environment Observation and Research Station, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiamen 361021, China.); Jiao, Xiaoyan (College of Resource and Environment, Shanxi Agricultural University, Taiyuan, China.); Shen, Ju-Pei (Key Laboratory for Humid Subtropical Eco-geographical Processes of the Ministry of Education, School of Geographical Sciences, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, China.); Yu, Dan-Ting (Key Laboratory for Humid Subtropical Eco-geographical Processes of the Ministry of Education, School of Geographical Sciences, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, China.); Li, Fangfang (Key Laboratory for Humid Subtropical Eco-geographical Processes of the Ministry of Education, School of Geographical Sciences, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, China.); Wu, Bingxue (Key Laboratory for Humid Subtropical Eco-geographical Processes of the Ministry of Education, School of Geographical Sciences, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, China.); He, Ji-Zheng (Key Laboratory for Humid Subtropical Eco-geographical Processes of the Ministry of Education, School of Geographical Sciences, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, China.); Hu, Hang-Wei (Key Laboratory for Humid Subtropical Eco-geographical Processes of the Ministry of Education, School of Geographical Sciences, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, China; School of Agriculture and Food, Faculty of Veterinary and Agricultural Sciences, The University of Melbourne, Parkville 3010, Victoria, Australia.

2618,pub.1138171871,10.1002/ajpa.24332,34009662,,,The 1918 influenza pandemic did not accelerate tuberculosis mortality decline in early‐20th century Newfoundland: Investigating historical and social explanations,"OBJECTIVES: The selective mortality hypothesis of tuberculosis after the 1918 influenza pandemic, laid out by Noymer and colleagues, suggests that acute exposure or pre-existing infection with tuberculosis (TB) increased the probability of pneumonia and influenza (P&I) mortality during the 1918 influenza pandemic, leading to a hastened decline of TB mortality in post-pandemic years. This study describes cultural determinants of the post-pandemic TB mortality patterns in Newfoundland and evaluates whether there is support for this observation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Death records and historical documents from the Provincial Archives of Newfoundland and Labrador were used to calculate age-standardized island-wide and sex-based TB mortality, as well as region-level TB mortality, for 1900-1939. The Joinpoint Regression Program (version 4.8.0.1) was used to estimate statistically significant changes in mortality rates.
RESULTS: Island-wide, females had consistently higher TB mortality for the duration of the study period and a significant shift to lower TB mortality beginning in 1928. There was no similar predicted significant decline for males. On the regional level, no models predicted a significant decline after the 1918 influenza pandemic, except for the West, where significant decline was predicted in the late-1930s.
DISCUSSION: Although there was no significant decline in TB mortality observed immediately post-pandemic, as has been shown for other Western nations, the female post-pandemic pattern suggests a decline much later. The general lack of significant decrease in TB mortality rate is likely due to Newfoundland's poor nutrition and lack of centralized healthcare rather than a biological interaction between P&I and TB.",ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was funded by National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant #1919515 and the University of Missouri Department of Anthropology H.

Contemporary theories assume that sexual reproduction should allow long term survival as dispersal and recombination of genetic material provides a population of organisms with the ability to adapt to environmental change. One of the most frustrating aspects of studying the evolution of reproductive systems is that we have not yet been able to utilize information locked within the fossil record to assess breeding system evolution in deep time. While the fossil record provides us with information on an organism's living environment, as well as some aspects of its ecology, the preservation of biological interactions (reproduction, feeding, symbiosis, communication) is exceedingly rare. Using both information from extant taxa uncovered by a plethora of biological and ecological studies and the rich representation of the Spinicaudata (Branchiopoda: Crustacea) throughout the fossil record (from the Devonian to today), we address two hypotheses of reproductive evolutionary theory: (1) that unisexual species should be short lived and less speciose than their outcrossing counterparts and (2) that androdioecy (mixtures of males and hermaphrodites) is an unstable, transitionary system that should not persist over long periods of time. We find no evidence of all-unisexual spinicaudatan taxa (clam shrimp) in the fossil record, but do find evidence of both androdioecious and dioecious clam shrimp. We find that clades with many androdioecious species are less speciose but persist longer than their mostly dioecious counterparts. These data suggest that all-unisexual lineages likely do not persist long whereas mixtures of unisexual and sexual breeding can persist for evolutionarily long periods but tend to produce fewer species than mostly sexual breeding.",,,Zoological Studies,,,"1021-5506, 1810-522X",,2020-08-05,2020,2020-08-05,,59,,e34,All OA; Gold,Article,"Astrop, Timothy I; Park Boush, Lisa; Weeks, Stephen C","Astrop, Timothy I (Fossil Forest Project, Blast Road, Brymbo, Wales, United Kingdom, LI11 5BT.

In order to obtain ecological information regarding the gold-spotted pond frog's habitat environment and biological interactions, we applied stable isotope analysis to quantify the ecological niche space (ENS) of frogs including black-spotted pond frogs (P. nigromaculatus) and bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus) within the food web of two different habitats-an ecological wetland park and a rice paddy. The gold-spotted pond frog population exhibited a broader ENS in the ecological wetland park than in the rice paddy. According to the carbon stable isotope ratios, gold-spotted pond frogs mainly fed on insects, regardless of habitat type. However, the results comparing the range of both carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes showed that gold-spotted pond frogs living in the rice paddy showed limited feeding behavior, while those living in the ecological wetland park fed on various food sources located in more varied trophic positions. Although the ENS of the gold-spotted pond frog was generally less likely to be overlapped by that of other frog species, it was predicted to overlap with a high probability of 87.3% in the ecological wetland park. Nevertheless, gold-spotted pond frogs in the ecological wetland park were not significantly affected by the prey competition with competitive species by feeding on other prey for which other species' preference was low. Since these results show that a habitats' food diversity has an effect on securing the ENS of gold-spotted pond frogs and prey competition, we recommend that the establishment of a food environment that considers the feeding behavior of gold-spotted pond frogs is important for the sustainable preservation of gold-spotted pond frogs and their settlement in alternative habitats.",,"This research was funded by the National Institute of Ecology, Ministry of Environment, Republic of Korea, grant number NIE-C-2018-04.",Animals,,MDPI,2076-2615,,2021-03-31,2021,2021-03-31,,11,4,967,All OA; Gold,Article,"Oh, Hye-Ji; Chang, Kwang-Hyeon; Jin, Mei-Yan; Suh, Jong-Mo; Yoon, Ju-Duk; Shin, Kyung-Hoon; Park, Su-Gon; Chang, Min-Ho","Oh, Hye-Ji (Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin 17104, Korea;, ohg2090@naver.com, (H.-J.O.);, chang38@khu.ac.kr, (K.-H.C.);, jinmeiyan8709@163.com, (M.-Y.J.)); Chang, Kwang-Hyeon (Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin 17104, Korea;, ohg2090@naver.com, (H.-J.O.);, chang38@khu.ac.kr, (K.-H.C.);, jinmeiyan8709@163.com, (M.-Y.J.)); Jin, Mei-Yan (Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin 17104, Korea;, ohg2090@naver.com, (H.-J.O.);, chang38@khu.ac.kr, (K.-H.C.);, jinmeiyan8709@163.com, (M.-Y.J.)); Suh, Jong-Mo (Integrative Freshwater Ecology Group, Centre for Advanced Studies of Blanes (CEAB-CSIC), Blanes 17300, Spain;, whdah9004@naver.com); Yoon, Ju-Duk (Research Center for Endangered Species, National Institute of Ecology, Yeongyang 36531, Korea;, grandblue@nie.re.kr); Shin, Kyung-Hoon (Department of Marine Sciences and Convergence Technology, Hanyang University, Ansan 15588, Korea;, shinkh@hanyang.ac.kr); Park, Su-Gon (Invasive Alien Species Research Team, National Institute of Ecology, Seocheon 33657, Korea;, park9663@nie.re.kr); Chang, Min-Ho (Environmental Impact Assessment Team, National Institute of Ecology, Seochen 33657, Korea)","Chang, Min-Ho (National Institute of Ecology)","Oh, Hye-Ji (Kyung Hee University); Chang, Kwang-Hyeon (Kyung Hee University); Jin, Mei-Yan (Kyung Hee University); Suh, Jong-Mo (Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Blane); Yoon, Ju-Duk (National Institute of Ecology); Shin, Kyung-Hoon (Hanyang University); Park, Su-Gon (National Institute of Ecology); Chang, Min-Ho (National Institute of Ecology)",Hanyang University; Kyung Hee University; National Institute of Ecology; Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Blane,grid.49606.3d; grid.289247.2; grid.496435.9; grid.423563.5,Seoul; Seoul; Gunsan; Blanes,; ; ; ,South Korea; South Korea; South Korea; Spain,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/11/4/967/pdf?version=1617938454,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136834439,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3109 Zoology,,,,,,A05 Biological Sciences,15 Life on Land

However, the question of whether and how both pesticides together might induce multi-stress conditions, which could induce indirect effects such as the modification of biological interactions within freshwater microbial communities has not received much attention. This study was undertaken to determine the effect of diuron and imidacloprid alone and in combination on the feeding behaviour of chironomid larvae. An initial experiment measured the impact of the different contamination conditions at environmental concentrations (5 μg L-1 for each pesticide) on the grazing rate of chironomids on three microalgae species, independently. Two diatom species, Gomphonema gracile (two different morphotypes: normal and teratogen) and Planothidium lanceolatum, and one green alga Desmodesmus sp. were offered as food, during 24 h. Chironomids grazing rates varied according to the pesticide and algae species. Indeed, diuron impacted algae more strongly and probably affected their palatability, leading chironomids to increase grazing pressure on less nutritionally interesting algae. Imidacloprid, by targeting insect larvae, increased or inhibited their grazing capacity depending on the food source. In a second experiment (cafeteria design), the food selectivity of chironomids on previous algae was determined under similar contamination conditions during 4 h: under diuron, larvae switched equally between the microalgae and were as mobile as in the control without pesticide. However, imidacloprid and the pesticide mixture condition altered chironomid movements and grazing behaviour. By investigating the impact of an herbicide and an insecticide, alone and in combination, on the responses of food (algae growth rate) and biological (mortality) and behavioural (mobility, food selection) responses of chironomid larvae, this study provided new insights on the direct and indirect effects of pesticide contamination on a simplified trophic web.","We thank the Animal ecology team of Bielefeld University for their welcome and tips, particularly Henrique Putzki and Christoph Ptatscheck for advice with chironomid experiments; and Benjamin Wilden for helping in cafeteria design set up.

Currently, there is little information about how future climate change scenarios will impact interactions between plants and their flower visitors in the tropics. This study analyzes the effects of warming and two soil water conditions on interactions between the tropical forage legume species Stylosanthes capitata and its floral visitors during the flowering period. We used a temperature-free air-controlled enhancement (T-FACE) facility to simulate future warming scenarios by increasing canopy temperature. The tested treatments were: irrigated and ambient canopy temperature (Control); non-irrigated and ambient canopy temperature (wS); irrigated and elevated canopy temperature (eT, +2 °C above ambient canopy temperature); and non-irrigated and elevated canopy temperature (wSeT). The effects of treatments on the time of flower opening and closing, sugar concentration in the nectar, and plant-flower visitor interactions were assessed. In the warmed treatments, S. capitata flower opening occurred ~45 min earlier compared to non-warmed treatments, and flowers remained opened for only ~3 h. Further, the sugar concentration in the nectar from eT was 39% higher than in the Control. The effects of warming on floral biology and flower resource production in S. capitata had an impact on the plant-floral visitor relationships with the bees Apis mellifera and Paratrigona lineata, the most abundant potential pollinating floral visitors, and the butterfly visitor Hemiargus hanno. Additionally, around noon, the interactive and additive effects of the combined wS and eT treatments decreased insect visiting frequency. These results suggest that warming and soil water deficiency could affect flower-visitor interactions and thus the reproductive success of S. capitata in tropical belts.","This study was supported by the Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) Thematic Project (Grant 08/58075-8), and by CNPq/ANA/MCTI (Grant 446357/2015-4 to CAM).

Although algal communities have been studied globally to understand the characteristics of HABs, the occurrence of toxic cyanobacteria in freshwater ecosystems is rarely understood. Unlike abiotic factors, the effects of biotic factors (e.g., interaction, dominance, and variability) on the occurrence of toxic cyanobacteria were overlooked due to the intricate interaction of microorganisms under different environmental conditions. To address this problem, a comprehensive ecological concept stability, which encompasses variations in species or communities due to changing biological interactions or environmental fluctuations, was applied in this study. The algal communities in six river-connected lakes in the North Han River, South Korea, were classified into high and low stability groups. The algal species belonging to diatoms and green algae groups played a major role in the interaction within the algal community in highly stable lakes, but the frequency of Microcystis led the interaction within the algal community at the center of the network in low-stability lakes. These results indicate that the interaction within the cluster is easily changed by Microcystis, where the abundance explosively increases in lakes with low algal community stability. Water quality is more strongly associated with the occurrence of toxic cyanobacteria (Microcystis and Dolichospermum). In low-stability lakes, more diverse water quality indicators are correlated with the development of toxic algae than in high-stability lakes. This paper is the first report on the importance of algal community stability in freshwater in the occurrence of toxic cyanobacteria and offers a new perspective on Microcystis monitoring and management.",,,Microbial Ecology,,Springer Nature,"0095-3628, 1432-184X",Ecosystem; Harmful Algal Bloom; Lakes; Microcystis; Rivers,2021-01-19,2021,2021-01-19,2021-08,82,2,309-318,Closed,Article,"Kim, Min Sung; Kim, Keon Hee; Hwang, Soon Jin; Lee, Tae Kwon","Kim, Min Sung (Department of Environmental Engineering, College of Health Science, Yonsei University, 26493, Gangwon, South Korea; Bio-Chemical Analysis Group, Center for Research Equipment, Korea Basic Science Institute, 28119, Cheongju, South Korea); Kim, Keon Hee (Department of Environmental Health Science, College of Life Science, Konkuk University, 05029, Seoul, South Korea); Hwang, Soon Jin (Department of Environmental Health Science, College of Life Science, Konkuk University, 05029, Seoul, South Korea); Lee, Tae Kwon (Department of Environmental Engineering, College of Health Science, Yonsei University, 26493, Gangwon, South Korea)","Lee, Tae Kwon (Yonsei University)","Kim, Min Sung (Yonsei University; Korea Basic Science Institute); Kim, Keon Hee (Konkuk University); Hwang, Soon Jin (Konkuk University); Lee, Tae Kwon (Yonsei University)",Konkuk University; Korea Basic Science Institute; Yonsei University,grid.258676.8; grid.410885.0; grid.15444.30,Seoul; Daejeon; Seoul,; ; ,South Korea; South Korea; South Korea,,,,,,4,4,0.53,1.68,1,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134708300,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3107 Microbiology,,,,,,C14 Geography and Environmental Studies,

The mahogany shoot borer, Hypsipyla grandella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), is one of the most economically important pests in all American tropical forests because it prevents the establishment of monoculture plantations of the family Meliaceae, such as Spanish cedar, Cedrela odorata L. Various studies have focussed on the bioecological aspects and the chemical and silvicultural control of this pest. However, relatively little is known about the biological interactions between this insect and its host plant. In this study, the shoot borer's behavior and attraction response to cedar host plants was evaluated in field cages. We also identified the volatiles emitted by healthy C. odorata plants that were attractive to H. grandella adults. The attraction to headspace volatiles from cedar plants and a synthetic blend were evaluated in a Y-glass tube olfactometer. We observed that virgin and mated females exhibited low activity at night, frequent movement of the antennae, sporadic flight activity, and short (< 10 s) and long (> 30 s) wing-fanning. Virgin females assumed a calling position, whereas mated females exhibited three periods of oviposition. The results showed that all evaluated categories – virgin females, virgin males, and mated females – were attracted to cedar plants. We identified the following volatile compounds: α-pinene, (E)-β-ocimene, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, limonene, nonanal, (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene, α-copaene, β-caryophyllene, and germacrene D. A synthetic blend significantly attracted virgin male and mated female shoot borers. Our results suggested that C. odorata volatiles compounds are responsible for the attraction of H. grandella.",We wish to thank José Ángel Damián Aragón for his assistance with biological material. We are also grateful to José E. Sánchez Vázquez for access to his laboratory facilities where we prepared food for H. grandella larvae.

In this study, we used a parasite and host system to infer the geographic overlaps between species with tight biological interaction, for example, parasites and their obligate host. Specifically, we used the horsehair worm Chordodes formosanus and its three mantis hosts to study the extent of niche overlap. We retrieved presence points for the host species and the parasite, and then we built SDMs with MaxEnt implemented in ENMeval using selected bioclim variables (based on variance inflation factor values) at 30s scale. The models showed that the hosts and parasite do not occur in the high elevation areas in Taiwan, which is expected based on their biology. Interestingly, the predicted parasite distribution included areas without collection records, implying local extinction or sampling bias. We subsequently evaluated niche overlap between hosts and the parasite according to five similarity indices (Schoener's D, I statistic, relative rank, Pearson correlation coefficient, and the rank correlation coefficient rho). Our models showed a high similarity of SDM predictions between hosts and the parasite. There were differences among metrics for which host shared the highest similarity with the parasite, but the majority of the results indicated that the Japanese boxing mantis had the highest niche similarity with the horsehair worm. The choice of the niche overlap metric to use can uncover information on the parasite's ecology, which can be important for endangered species. SDMs are reliable tools for host and parasite conservation management and could help improve our understanding of parasite biology and ecology.","We thank all the iNaturalist users who uploaded their observations of the organisms examined in this study.

In coastal systems, trematode parasites affect their hosts by disrupting their life-history traits. However, the effects of parasitism could be variable and dependent on the prevailing environmental conditions where the host-parasite interaction occurs. This study compared the effect of a trematode parasite in the family Renicolidae (metacercariae) on the body size and the shell organic and mechanical characteristics of the intertidal mussels Perumytilus purpuratus, inhabiting two environmentally contrasting localities in northern and central Chile (ca. 1600 km apart). Congruent with the environmental gradient along the Chilean coast, higher levels of temperature, salinity and pCO2, and a lower pH characterise the northern locality compared to that of central Chile. In the north, parasitised individuals showed lower body size and shell resistance than non-parasitised individuals, while in central Chile, the opposite pattern was observed. Protein level in the organic matter of the shell was lower in the parasitised hosts than in the non-parasitised ones regardless of the locality. However, an increase in polysaccharide levels was observed in the parasitised individuals from central Chile. These results evidence that body size and shell properties of P. purpuratus vary between local populations and that they respond differently when confronting the parasitism impacts. Considering that the parasite prevalence reaches around 50% in both populations, if parasitism is not included in the analysis, the true response of the host species would be masked by the effects of the parasite, skewing our understanding of how environmental variables will affect marine species. Considering parasitism and identifying its effects on host species faced with environmental drivers is essential to understand and accurately predict the ecological consequences of climate change.","This study was funded by FONDECYT 3170522, 11220593 and ANID PAI77190031 to RGH; PIA ANID ANILLOS ACT172037 and PCI ANID REDES170106 to RGH, MA, NAL and ARN.

Generally, the superior ecological competitor Ae. albopictus displaces Ae. aegypti from most geographic areas, with the combining factors of biology and environment influencing the competitive outcome. Nonetheless, detailed studies asserting displacement come largely from sub-tropical areas, with relatively less effort being made in tropical environments, including no comprehensive research about Aedes biological interactions in Mesoamerica. Here, we examine contemporary and historical mosquito surveillance data to assess the role of shifting abiotic conditions in shaping the spatiotemporal distribution of competing Aedes species in the Republic of Panama. In accordance with prior studies, we show that Ae. albopictus has displaced Ae. aegypti under suboptimal wet tropical climate conditions and more vegetated environments within the southwestern Azuero Peninsula. Conversely, in the eastern Azuero Peninsula, Ae. aegypti persists with Ae. albopictus under optimal niche conditions in a dry and more seasonal tropical climate. While species displacement was stable over the course of two years, the presence of both species generally appears to fluctuate in tandem in areas of coexistence. Aedes albopictus was always more frequently found and abundant regardless of location and climatic season. The heterogenous environmental conditions of Panama shape the competitive outcome and micro-geographic distribution of Aedes mosquitoes, with potential consequences for the transmission dynamics of urban and sylvatic zoonotic diseases.","We are thankful to the Panamanian Ministry of Environment (Mi Ambiente) and MINSA for supporting scientific collecting of mosquitoes in Panama, and for sharing data with us concerning the distribution of Aedes mosquitos from 2005 to 2017 across the country, respectively.

Extrinsic forces operating over broad spatial scales can impart synchronous behavior to separate populations, while internal, system-specific drivers often lead to idiosyncratic behavior. Here, we demonstrate synchrony in community-level dynamics among phytoplankton and bacteria in six north temperate humic lakes. The influence of regional meteorological factors explained much of the temporal variability in the phytoplankton community, and resulted in synchronous patterns of community change among lakes. Bacterial dynamics, in contrast, were driven by system-specific interactions with phytoplankton. Despite the importance of intrinsic factors for determining bacterial community composition and dynamics, we demonstrated that biological interactions transmitted the signal of the regional extrinsic drivers to the bacterial communities, ultimately resulting in synchronous community phenologies for bacterioplankton communities as well. This demonstrates how linkages between the components of a complex biological system can work to simplify the dynamics of the system and implies that it may be possible to predict the behavior of microbial communities responsible for important biogeochemical services in the landscape.","We gratefully acknowledge the technical assistance of A Ecker, J Epstein, J Morrison, J Thoyre, and the logistical support of the University of Wisconsin-Madison Trout Lake Research Station.

Beneficial bacteria are often called ""mutualistic"" even if mutual reciprocity of benefits has not been demonstrated and despite the plausibility of other explanations for these microbes' beneficial effects on host fitness. Furthermore, beneficial bacteria often occur in diverse communities, making mutualism both empirically and conceptually difficult to demonstrate. We suggest reserving the terms ""mutualism"" and ""parasitism"" for pairwise interactions where the relationship is largely independent of other species and can be verified by measuring the fitness effect experienced by both partners. In hosts with diverse microbial communities, we propose re-formulating some of the essential questions of symbiosis research - e.g. concerning specificity, transmission mode, and common evolutionary fates - as questions of community ecology and ecosystem function, allowing important biological interactions to be investigated without making assumptions about reciprocity. Understanding the fitness of host-associated bacteria is a crucial component of investigations into the role of microbes in eukaryote evolution.","Acknowledgements We thank Sebastian Gygli, Brandon Seah, and two anonymous reviewers for their thoughtful comments on the manuscript.

Results reveal that microfungal diversity values calculated from above-ground food stores are highest in the more commonly disturbed portions of the rodent dens. Interactions among food-inhabiting microbes and between the rodents and food-inhabiting microbes also appear to influence the microfungal communities within the rodent dens. For example, our data suggest that transport by animal vectors, and not by air currents, is more effective at dispersing microbial propagules. Furthermore, although fungal communities inhabiting food stores within dens varied in composition and diversity over time, standardized substrates (sorghum seeds) simultaneously placed within the food stores converged in microfungal composition the longer they were left within the dens. We hypothesize that animal vectors, including rodents, make neighboring fungal communities more alike by introducing similar communities of microbes, which in turn initiate a cascade of biological interactions that, over time, result in similar microfungal communities inhabiting newly stored food items.",,,Microbial Ecology,,Springer Nature,"0095-3628, 1432-184X",,1999-07,1999,,1999-07,38,1,79-91,Closed,Article,"Herrera, J.; Kramer, C.L.; Reichman, O.J.","Herrera, J.

Recent discussions concerning ecosystem ""regime shifts"" again raise the question of whether population fluctuations are mainly controlled by external forcing. Results of nonlinear time series analyses indicate that pelagic populations typically do not passively track stochastic environmental variables. Rather, population dynamics are better described as nonlinear amplification of physical forcing by biological interactions. However, we illustrate that in some cases populations do show linear tracking of the physical environment. To explain why population dynamics can sometimes be linear, we propose the linear tracking window hypothesis: populations are most likely to track the stochastic environmental forcing when their generation time matches the characteristic time scale of the environmental signal. While our observations follow this hypothesis well, our results indicate that the linear tracking window is a necessary but not a sufficient condition.","This work was inspired by the pioneering work on ecological nonlinearity by George Sugihara.

Furthermore, the impact of seawater acidification on these relationships was determined during this 40-day exposure experiment. Using carbon dioxide (CO2) gas, seawater was acidified to pHNBS 7.6, 7.2 or 6.8. Control treatments were maintained in natural seawater (pH≈8.0). Under normocapnic conditions, burrowing urchins were seen to reduce the sediment uptake of nitrite or nitrate whilst enhancing the release of silicate and phosphate. In acidified (hypercapnic) treatments, the biological control of biogeochemical cycles by urchins was significantly affected, probably through the combined impacts of high CO2 on nitrifying bacteria, benthic algae and urchin behaviour. This study highlights the importance of considering biological interactions when predicting the consequences of seawater acidification on ecosystem function.","This study was part-funded by a joint DEFRA/DTI funded Project IMCO2 (http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/coal/cfft/cct/pub) and the NERC Standard Grant (NE/C510016/1) awarded to S.W.

Here, we study Elacatinus gobies and the 'client' fishes they clean. Colourful stripes are common to mutualist cleaners and noncleaning sister species. Blue stripes are unique to cleaners and are more conspicuous to predators than are basal yellow or green stripes. In turn, we focused on the role of colour as a potentially specialized signal. We show that cleaners may possess a chemical defence and demonstrate that stripes are sufficient to elicit client posing behaviour and to deter attack, corroborating the putative role of chemistry. Analysis of previously published records shows that yellow cleaners interact with predatory clients less often compared to green and blue cleaners. Our results highlight evolution from predator resistance to advertising with conspicuous signals. Similar trajectories, via recognizable signals to risky partners, may be common in other diffuse mutualisms.","Portions of the work were supported by a National Science Foundation (NSF) Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) fellowship and a Smithsonian Link fellowship to L.L., as well as grants from the NSF (IOS 0546423) and Alfred P.

Sympatric benthic and limnetic ecotypes of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) exhibit divergent pigment patterns. To test whether differential predation by cutthroat trout contributes to the differences in pigmentation seen between the ecotypes, we used a within-generation selection experiment on F2 benthic-limnetic hybrids. After 10 months of differential selection, we compared the pigmentation of fish under trout predation to control fish not exposed to trout predation. We found that stickleback exhibited more lateral barring in ponds with trout predation. Ponds with trout were also less turbid, and a greater degree of barring was negatively correlated with the magnitude of turbidity across pond replicates. A more benthic diet, a proxy for habitat use, was also correlated with greater lateral barring and green dorsal pigmentation. These patterns suggest that differential exposure to cutthroat trout predation may explain the divergence in body pigmentation between benthic and limnetic ecotypes.",We thank Catherine Peichel for her feedback on the project and manuscript.

Under the ""Red Queen"" hypothesis, coevolving parasites reduce the reproductive advantage of asexual reproduction by adapting to infect clonal genotypes after they become locally common. In addition, the ""geographic mosaic"" theory of coevolution proposes that structured populations of interacting species can produce selection mosaics manifested as coevolutionary ""hot spots"" and ""cold spots"". Here, we tested whether a steep, habitat-specific cline in the frequency of sexual reproduction in a freshwater snail could be explained by the existence of hot spots and cold spots for coevolving parasites. We found that the shallow-water margins of lakes, where sexual reproduction is most common, are coevolutionary hot spots, and that deeper habitats are cold spots. These results are consistent with the geographic mosaic theory, in that the intensity of selection resulting from biological interactions can vary sharply in space. The results also support the Red Queen hypothesis, in that sex is associated with coevolutionary hot spots for virulent parasites.","We thank J. van Berkel (University of Canterbury) for providing laboratory facilities in New Zealand, M.

The consequences of living in these extreme habitats are not well established. In particular, little it is known about of the effects of hypercanic seawater (i.e. high pCO2 levels) on marine vertebrates such as intertidal pool fish. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of increased pCO2 on the physiology and behavior in juveniles of the intertidal pool fish Girella laevifrons. Two nominal pCO2 concentrations (400 and 1600μatm) were used. We found that exposure to hypercapnic conditions did not affect oxygen consumption and absorption efficiency. However, the lateralization and boldness behavior was significantly disrupted in high pCO2 conditions. In general, a predator-risk cost of boldness is assumed, thus the increased occurrence of shy personality in juvenile fishes may result in a change in the balance of this biological interaction, with significant ecological consequences.","We thank S.

These numerical responses are interchangeable because both recognize negative feedback loops between consumer and food abundance resulting in population regulation. We review how demographic and isocline numerical responses have been used to enhance our understanding of population regulation of kangaroos and possums, and argue that their utility may be increased by explicitly accounting for non-equilibrium dynamics (due to environmental variability and/or biological interactions) and the existence of multiple limiting factors. Interferential numerical response functions may help bridge three major historical dichotomies in population ecology (equilibrium versus non-equilibrium dynamics, extrinsic versus intrinsic regulation and demographic versus isocline numerical responses).",,,Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B Biological Sciences,,The Royal Society,"0962-8436, 1471-2970","Animals; Artiodactyla; Carnivora; Demography; Diet, Vegetarian; Environment; Food Chain; Logistic Models; Macropodidae; New Zealand; Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted; Opossums; Population Density; Population Growth; Wolves",2002-09-29,2002,2002-09-29,2002-09-29,357,1425,1233-1248,All OA; Green,Article,"Bayliss, Peter; Choquenot, David","Bayliss, Peter (Environment Australia, Environmental Research Institute of the Supervising Scientist (ERISS) and National Centre for Tropical Wetlands Research, GPO Box 461, Darwin, NT 0801, Australia); Choquenot, David (Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental Research, Natural Resources and Environment, PO Box 137 Heidelberg, VIC 3084, Australia)","Bayliss, Peter ","Bayliss, Peter (); Choquenot, David (Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental Research)",Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental Research,grid.508407.e,Melbourne,Victoria,Australia,,,,,,53,10,0.52,3.62,,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc1693022?pdf=render,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1021769335,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,B10 Mathematical Sciences,

We have found that in habitats with the same carrying capacity, aggregated distributions preserve smaller populations than do uniform distributions, i.e., they are less efficient. Nonetheless, we have also found that aggregated distributions, among other factors, can help the evolutionary stability of some biological interactions, such as predator-prey interactions, despite their granting less individual fitness. Besides, the competitive exclusion principle does not usually stand in populations with aggregated distribution. We have applied ECA to study the effects of aggregated distribution in two notorious cases: in the so-called paradox of the plankton and in gregarious animals. In doing so, we intend to ratify long-established ecological knowledge explaining these phenomena from a new perspective. In the first case, due to aggregate distribution, large aggregations of digital organisms mimicking very abundant planktonic species, leave large patches or oceanic areas free for other less competitive organisms, which mimic rare species, to prosper. In this case, we can see how effects, such as ecological drift and the small portion, act simultaneously. In the second case of aggregation, the aggregate distribution of gregarious animals could be explained under specialized predator-prey interactions and interdemic competition. Thus, digital organisms that imitate predators reduce the competitive capacity of their prey, destabilizing their competitiveness against other species. The specialized predator also goes extinct if the prey goes extinct by natural selection. Predators that have an aggregate distribution compensate the prey and thus avoid exclusion. This way there are more predator-free patches in which the prey can prosper. However, by granting greater colonization capacity to its prey, the predator loses competitiveness. Therefore, it is a multilevel selection event in which group adaptation grows to the detriment of the predator as an individual.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the computer resources, technical expertise, and assistance provided by the SCBI (Supercomputing and Bioinformatics) center of the University of Málaga.

Most models of mutualism address systems where interaction outcomes slide along a mutualism-antagonism continuum as environmental conditions vary altering cost-benefit relationships. However, these models do not apply to the many mutualisms that involve by-product benefits and others that do not have antagonistic alternate states. The ubiquity of such mutualisms indicates a need for different approaches and models to understand how environmental variability influences their strength, stability, and ecological roles. In this paper, we apply the concept of context dependency to mutualisms among bark beetles and fungi that span a variety of life strategies and exposures to environmental variability. Bark beetles and their mutualist fungi co-construct a niche based on by-product benefits that allows them to exist in a resource that is otherwise intractable or inaccessible. For the closest of these partnerships, this has resulted in some of the most influential agents of forest mortality in conifer forests worldwide. Understanding these symbioses is key to understanding their influence on forest structure and dynamics and responses to change. We found no evidence that bark beetle mutualisms change in sign as conditions vary, only in magnitude, and that the ""closest"" (and most environmentally influential) of these partnerships have evolved behaviors and mechanisms to reduce context-dependency and stabilize benefit delivery. The bark beetle-fungus symbioses most likely to slide along a mutualism-antagonism continuum are those involving loosely associated facultative symbionts that may provide benefits under some circumstances and that are horizontally transmitted by the beetle host. Additionally, some symbiotic fungi are never mutualists - these ""third party"" fungi are exploiters and may shift from commensalism to antagonism depending on environmental context. Our assessment indicates that a careful differentiation between bark beetle-fungus partnerships is crucial to understanding how they influence forests and respond to environmental variability.",,,Frontiers in Microbiology,,Frontiers,1664-302X,,2021-05-12,2021,2021-05-12,,12,,682187,All OA; Gold,Article,"Six, Diana L.; Klepzig, Kier D.","Six, Diana L.

The aim of this work was to document the spatial and temporal chemical biogeography of Monarda fistulosa. I collected leaves from 1587 M. fistulosa individuals from 86 populations from Colorado to Manitoba, extracted and analyzed their terpenes with gas chromatography, mapped monoterpene chemotypes, and analyzed chemical variation with principal component analysis. I also measured the amounts of terpenes in different plant tissues to examine intraplant variation and monitored leaf terpene chemistry over a single growing season to examine temporal patterns. Finally, I extracted terpenes from herbarium samples up to 125 years old and compared the chemotypes with recent samples from the same sites. M. fistulosa populations consisted mostly of thymol (T) and carvacrol (C) chemotypes, but geraniol (G) and (R)-(-)-linalool (L), a chemotype new to this species, were also present. A principal component analysis showed that most of the chemical variation across populations was due to the amounts of the dominant terpene in plants. Intraplant tissue chemistry revealed that leaves mostly had the greatest amounts of terpenes, followed by floral structures, stems, and roots. Short-term temporal variation in leaf chemistry of T and C plants over a growing season showed that plants produced the highest levels of biosynthetic precursors early in the season and their dominant monoterpenes peaked in mid-summer. Plant chemotype was discernable in the oldest herbarium samples, and 15 of 18 historic samples matched the majority chemotype currently at the site, indicating that population chemotype ratios may remain stable over longer time scales. Overall, the results show that plant species' secondary chemistry can vary both spatially and temporally, which may alter the biological interactions that these compounds mediate over space and time.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Lynn Riedel [Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks (BOSMP)], Helios Hernandez (Manitoba Conservation), and Andy Kratz (US Forest Service) assisted in obtaining permits to collect on public lands.

Previous studies have investigated how climate change will alter these dynamics for herbaceous species, but there is a knowledge gap related to how woody species such as tree seedlings will be affected. Here, we modeled temperate tree seedling leaf-out phenology and canopy close phenology in response to environmental drivers and used climate change projections to forecast changes to the duration of spring phenological escape. We then used these predictions to estimate changes in annual carbon assimilation while accounting for reduced carbon assimilation rates associated with hotter and drier summers. Lastly, we applied these estimates to previously published models of seedling growth and survival to investigate the net effect on seedling demographic performance. Our models predict that temperate tree seedlings will experience improved phenological escape and, therefore, increased spring carbon assimilation under climate change conditions. However, increased summer respiration costs will offset the gains in spring under extreme climate change leading to a net loss in annual carbon assimilation and demographic performance. Furthermore, we found that annual carbon assimilation predictions depend strongly on the species of nearby canopy tree that seedlings were planted near, with all seedlings projected to assimilate less carbon (and therefore experience worse demographic performance) when planted near Quercus rubra canopy trees as opposed to Acer saccharum canopy trees. We conclude that changes to spring phenological escape will have important effects on how tree seedling recruitment is affected by climate change, with the magnitude of these effects dependent upon climate change severity and biological interactions with neighboring adults. Thus, future studies of temperate forest recruitment should account for phenological escape dynamics in their models.","B. Lee was funded by the (Shrank Summer Research Support Fund) and I.

The success of this interaction depends on the recognition of the right partner by the plant within the richest microbial ecosystems on Earth, the soil. Recent metagenomic studies of the soil biome have revealed its complexity, which includes microorganisms that affect plant fitness and growth in a beneficial, harmful, or neutral manner. In this complex scenario, understanding the molecular mechanisms by which legumes recognize and discriminate rhizobia from pathogens, but also between distinct rhizobia species and strains that differ in their symbiotic performance, is a considerable challenge. In this work, we will review how plants are able to recognize and select symbiotic partners from a vast diversity of surrounding bacteria. We will also analyze recent advances that contribute to understand changes in plant gene expression associated with the outcome of the symbiotic interaction.

Here, utilizing large time-series 16S rRNA gene data, we show that in activated sludge of an environmentally important municipal wastewater treatment plant, 5-year temporal dynamics of bacterial community shows no significant seasonal succession, but is consistent with deterministic assemblage by taxonomic relatedness. Biological interactions are dominant drivers in determining the bacterial community assembly, whereas environmental conditions (mainly sludge retention time and inorganic nitrogen) partially explain phylogenetic and quantitative variances and indirectly influence bacterial assembly. We demonstrate a correlation-based statistical method to integrate bacterial association networks with their taxonomic affiliations to predict community-wide co-occurrence and co-exclusion patterns. The results show that although taxonomically closely related bacteria tend to positively co-occur (for example, out of a cooperative relationship), negative co-excluding correlations are deterministically observed between taxonomically less related species, probably implicating roles of competition in determining bacterial assembly. Overall, disclosures of the positive and negative species–species relations will improve our understanding of ecological niches occupied by unknown species and help to predict their biological functions in ecosystems.","We would like to thank GRF of Hong Kong for financial support (7195/06E, 7197/08E, 7202/09E, 7198/10E, 7201/11E and 7190/12E) on this long-term research project.

Successional patterns of litter-degrading bacteria remain poorly documented, especially in undisturbed environments. Here we conducted an experiment with tank bromeliads as natural freshwater microcosms to assess major trends in bacterial succession on two leaf-litter species incubated with or without animal exclusion. We used amplicon sequencing and a co-occurrence network to assess changes in bacterial community structure according to treatments. Alpha-diversity and community complexity displayed the same trends regardless of the treatments, highlighting that primary succession of detrital-bacteria is subject to resource limitation and biological interactions, much like macro-organisms. Shifts in bacterial assemblages along the succession were characterized by an increase in uncharacterized taxa and potential N-fixing bacteria, the latter being involved in positive co-occurrence between taxa.

A common reef-building coral, Acropora millepora, displays conspicuous fluorescent polymorphism during all phases of its life cycle, due to the differential expression of fluorescent proteins (FPs) of the green fluorescent protein family. In this study, we examine whether fluorescent variation in young coral juveniles exposed to natural sediments is associated with the uptake of disparate Symbiodinium assemblages determined using ITS-2 deep sequencing. We found that Symbiodinium assemblages varied significantly when redness values varied, specifically in regards to abundances of clades A and C. Whether fluorescence was quantified as a categorical or continuous trait, clade A was found at higher abundances in redder juveniles. These preliminary results suggest juvenile fluorescence may be associated with Symbiodinium uptake, potentially acting as either an attractant to ecologically specific types or as a mechanism to modulate the internal light environment to control Symbiodinium physiology within the host.","Funding was provided by the Australian Research Council through ARC CE1401000020.

One of their intriguing features is their ability to coexist despite sharing the same, specialized diet. Using co-occurrence data (photographs of giraffes with oxpeckers on them) and approximate Bayesian computing, we demonstrate that yellow-billed oxpeckers changed host faster than red-billed oxpeckers and appeared to displace red-billed oxpeckers from preferred giraffe body parts. Conversely, red-billed oxpeckers exhibited a fuller use of each host and displaced yellow-billed oxpeckers from distal giraffe body parts. These findings highlight that the partition of giraffe hosts in two separate niches was only part of the coexistence story in this species pair. More precisely, the oxpeckers shared the resource by exploiting it at different rates. They engaged in different trade-offs between giving-up density, patch discovery rate and competitor displacement ability.

Species turnover generates a wide spectrum of species assemblages, resulting in different competition intensities among taxa, creating restrictions as important as environmental constraints. We chose to adopt the widely used phylogenetic relatedness (NRI) measurement to define a metric that depicts competition strength (via phylogenetic similarity), which one focal species confronts in its environment. This new approach (NRIfocal) measures the potential of the community structure effect over performance of a single species. We chose two ecologically similar Peucaea sparrows, which co-occur and have highly dissimilar range size to test whether the population response to competition intensity is different between species. We analyzed the correlation between both Peucaea species population sizes and NRIfocal using data from point counts. Results indicated that the widespread species population size was not associated with NRIfocal, whereas the population of restricted-sized species exhibited a negative relationship with competition intensity. Consequently, a species' sensitivity to competition might be a limiting factor to range expansion, which provides new insights into geographic range analysis and community ecology.","Acknowledgments We express our thanks to Eduardo Almanza, Tereso Hernandez, and Carlos Miranda for field assistance.

Assessing the relative influence of local ecological interactions versus regional species pools on local species richness should help bridge this conceptual gap. Plots of local species richness versus regional species pools have been used to address this question, yet after an active quarter-century of research on the relative influence of local interactions versus regional species pools, consensus remains elusive. We propose a conceptual framework that incorporates spatial scale and ecological interaction strength to reconcile current disparities. We then test this framework using a survey of marine rocky intertidal algal and invertebrate communities from the northeast Pacific. We reach two main conclusions. First, these data show that the power of regional species pools to predict local richness disintegrates at small spatial scales coincident with the scale of biological interactions, when studying ecologically interactive groups of species, and in generally more abiotically stressful habitats (e.g., the high intertidal). Second, conclusions of past studies asserting that the regional species pool is the primary driver of local species richness may be artifacts of large spatial scales or ecologically noninteractive groups of species.",,,The American Naturalist,,University of Chicago Press,"0003-0147, 1537-5323",Animals; Biodiversity; Food Chain; Invertebrates; Pacific States; Seaweed,2006-05-08,2006,2006-05-08,2006-06,167,6,e158-70,Closed,Article,"Russell, Roly; Wood, Spencer A; Allison, Gary; Menge, Bruce A","Russell, Roly (Department of Zoology, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon 97331, USA. roly@fulbrightweb.org); Wood, Spencer A (); Allison, Gary (); Menge, Bruce A ()",,"Russell, Roly (Oregon State University); Wood, Spencer A (); Allison, Gary (); Menge, Bruce A ()",Oregon State University,grid.4391.f,Corvallis,Oregon,United States,,,,,,44,4,0.43,3.34,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1058784342,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,C14 Geography and Environmental Studies,14 Life Below Water

Therefore, we assessed the flower visitors of five tree species in a restored area of Semideciduous Seasonal Forest, in Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brazil. The specimens were collected using entomological net on flowers of Acacia polyphylla, Aegiphila sellowianna, Croton floribundus, Croton urucurana and Schinus terebinthifolius from October 2007 to September 2008. A total of 139 insect species belonging to five orders were collected. Hymenoptera was the most diverse order collected. From a total of 37 families, Vespidae (15 species), Cabronidae (12), Apidae (10), Halictidae (10), Syrphidae (12), Tachinidae (6) and Hesperidae (7) were the richest ones. Schinus terebinthifolius flowers presented the most abundant and diverse insect visitors (60), suggesting it is an important attractive species to the fauna in restoration programs. Our data suggest that mutualistic interactions between some of these plants and their flower-visiting insects may be in a reinstatement process, and will support the design and monitoring of future restoration efforts.","We highly acknowledge Sidnei Mateus, José Carlos Serrano and Maria Isabel Protti de Andrade Balbi for helping with bees, wasps and flies identification, respectively.

The model, comprising nutrients and phytoplankton, includes the effect of nutrient uptake by phytoplankton as a Holling type II functional response, and also includes the effect of zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton as a Holling type II non-dynamical term. The mean-field model without the diffusion and advection terms shows both bistability and limit-cycle oscillations as a few parameters such as the input rate of nutrients and the maximum feeding rate of zooplankton are changed. If the parameter values are chosen from the limit-cycle oscillation region, the corresponding reaction-advection-diffusion equations show spatial pattern formations by the combined effects of advection and diffusion by turbulent stirring and mixing, and biological interactions. As the nutrient input is increased, the system behaviour changes from the extinction of the entire phytoplankton to the formation of filamentous patterns, patchiness patterns and homogeneous distributions.

Indeed, knowledge concerning biological interactions of microbes and meiofauna in marine extreme environments is scarce, especially for nematodes. In this study, we used microscopic observations [fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)] and metabarcoding of 16S rRNA to characterize the bacterial community of the nematode species Oncholaimus dyvae, an overlooked but ecologically important vent organism. Detection of bacteria in the buccal cavity and on the cuticle (SEM) and epibionts in its intestine (FISH) suggests that O. dyvae harbors its own bacterial community. Molecular results and phylogenetic analysis show that bacteria associated with this species are related to symbiotic lineages typical of hydrothermal vent fauna, such as sulfur-oxidizing bacteria related to Epsilonproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria. This multi-approach study suggests a potential symbiotic role of bacteria with its nematode host and opens new research perspectives on vent meiofauna.","Special thanks go to the chief scientists, captains and crews of the R/V Pourquoi pas? and the pilots of the VICTOR 6000 ROV for their invaluable support during the Momarsat (2011), Biobaz (2013), and Momarsat (2017) cruises.

Here we show that engineering effects can indirectly strengthen top-down effects mediated by predator abundance. We conducted a small-scale manipulative field experiment and broad-scale field observations of the plant, web spider, and detrital insect system in forest understory habitats. In the field experiment, artificially increasing architectural elements enhanced the abundance of spiders by providing physical support for web building. Moreover, aerial insects derived from the detrital food web decreased in response to increased spider abundance. As artificial architecture per se did not affect aerial detritivores, these results indicate that ecosystem engineering indirectly strengthens top-down effects mediated by predators. In field observations conducted in 12 cedar forests, path analyses supported the importance of an indirect pathway originating from understory vegetation complexity to spider abundance and to aerial detritivores. The effect size of spiders on detrital insects was similar in the field experiment and in the observations. These results indicate that the engineering effects of plants cascade to detrital insects through web spiders across different scales.","We thank David Wise and Tadashi Fukami for valuable comments.

Compared to solitary insects, social insects have evolved multi-level immunity that includes immune responses common to holometabolous insects, and social immunity, which is exclusive to social taxa. This suggests that social insects may be subject to high pathogen pressure, yet relatively little is known about the range of symbiotic and pathogenic microbial communities that associate with social insects. In this study we examined transcriptome data generated from the ant Formica exsecta for sequences identifying as microbes (or other organisms potentially of non-ant origin). Sequences showing homology to two viruses and several other potentially or obligate intracellular organisms, such as Wolbachia, Arsenophonus, Entomoplasmatales and Microsporidia, were present in the transcriptome data. These homologous sequence matches correspond to genera/species that have previously been associated with a variety of insects, including social insects. There were also sequences with identity to several other microbes such as common moulds and soil bacteria. We conclude that this sequence data provides a starting point for a deeper understanding of the biological interactions between a species of ant and the micro- and macrobiotic communities that it potentially encounters.","This work received funding from Academy of Finland (http://www.aka.fi/eng) grant numbers 140990 and 135970 to Heikki Helanterä, 134561 to Kalevi Trontti, and Centre of Excellence in Biological Interactions grant number 251337 to Liselotte Sundström.

An important mechanism causing this adverse ecological impact is the change in the encounter rates (i.e. the rates at which individuals meet other organisms of the same or different species). Yet, how fragmentation can change encounter rates is poorly understood. To gain insight into the problem, here we ask how landscape fragmentation affects encounter rates when all other relevant variables remain fixed. We present strong numerical evidence that fragmentation decreases search efficiencies thus encounter rates. What is surprising is that it falls even when the global average densities of interacting organisms are held constant. In other words, fragmentation per se can reduce encounter rates. As encounter rates are fundamental for biological interactions, it can explain part of the observed diminishing in animal biodiversity. Neglecting this effect may underestimate the negative outcomes of fragmentation. Partial deforestation and roads that cut through forests, for instance, might be responsible for far greater damage than thought. Preservation policies should take into account this previously overlooked scientific fact.",,,Journal of The Royal Society Interface,,The Royal Society,"1742-5689, 1742-5662","Animals; Biodiversity; Canada; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecology; Ecosystem; Environment; Forestry; Models, Biological; Models, Statistical; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Strigiformes; Trees",2014-02-06,2014,2014-02-06,2014-02-06,11,91,20130887,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Wosniack, M.

Here, we developed a state-of-the-art method integrating biological theory with survey and experimental data in a way that allows us to explicitly model both physical tolerance limits of species and inherent natural variability in regional conditions and thereby improve the reliability of species distribution predictions under future climate conditions. By using a macroalga-herbivore association (Fucus vesiculosus - Idotea balthica) as a case study, we illustrated how salinity reduction and temperature increase under future climate conditions may significantly reduce the occurrence and biomass of these important coastal species. Moreover, we showed that the reduction of herbivore occurrence is linked to reduction of their host macroalgae. Spatial predictive modelling and experimental biology have been traditionally seen as separate fields but stronger interlinkages between these disciplines can improve species distribution projections under climate change. Experiments enable qualitative prior knowledge to be defined and identify cause-effect relationships, and thereby better foresee alterations in ecosystem structure and functioning under future climate conditions that are not necessarily seen in projections based on non-causal statistical relationships alone.","J.K., H.J., L.R., V.J., H.O.K., S.L., P.R.J. and K.J. were supported by the BONUS project BAMBI, the joint Baltic Sea research and development programme (Art 185), funded jointly from the European Union’s Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration and various national research funding agencies of the Baltic Sea countries.

These patterns could be playing an important role in biological interactions, population size, and connectivity, and potential extinction risk in amphibians. Here, we tested the effects of spatial and environmental factors on the variation, turnover, and phylogenetic diversity of anuran amphibian species in tropical forests of western Ecuador. Data for presence/absence of 101 species of 34 genera and 10 families registered in 12 sites (nested in four biogeographic units) were obtained through fieldwork, museum collections, and literature records. We examined the influence of geographical, altitudinal, temperature, and precipitation distances on differences in anuran composition between sites. We found significant positive correlations among all of these variables with anuran distribution. The greatest alpha diversity (species richness) was found in the Equatorial Chocó biogeographic unit. Equatorial Pacific biogeographic unit could act as a transition zone between the Equatorial Chocó and Equatorial Tumbes. The western Andes (Western Cordillera biogeographic unit) was the most dissimilar and exhibited a higher species turnover rate than the other biogeographic units. Our results suggest that precipitation and elevation play a key role in maintaining the diversity of amphibian species in western Ecuador.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We would like to thank Diogo B.

SSDs are usually based on the results from short-term laboratory experiments performed under constant environmental conditions. However, different species may be kept at different ""optimal"" temperatures, which influence their apparent sensitivity and thus the derivation of endpoints. Also, the extrapolation capacity of SSDs is largely limited to the tested species and conditions. Time-variable exposures and effects at higher levels of biological organization, including biological interactions, are not considered. The quantitative effect prediction at higher tiers would ultimately require the extrapolation of toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics to untested species and the involvement of population and community modeling. In this regard, we tested a toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic modeling approach to mechanistically consider and correct endpoints for ambient temperature and demonstrate the significance for SSDs. We explored correlations in toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic model parameters which would allow for the extrapolation of sensitivities to untested species. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of the approach for higher level effect predictions using an individual-based model. Our results suggest that mechanistic effect modeling approaches can reduce the uncertainties in higher tier effect assessments related to knowledge gaps.",This study was financially supported by the CEFIC Long-Range Research Initiative (project no.

We perform the first critical test of the 'biotic replacement' hypothesis using combined palaeoecological and geochemical data collected from the youngest Ediacaran strata in southern Namibia. We find that, even after accounting for a variety of potential sampling and taphonomic biases, the Ediacaran assemblage preserved at Farm Swartpunt has significantly lower genus richness than older assemblages. Geochemical and sedimentological analyses confirm an oxygenated and non-restricted palaeoenvironment for fossil-bearing sediments, thus suggesting that oxygen stress and/or hypersalinity are unlikely to be responsible for the low diversity of communities preserved at Swartpunt. These combined analyses suggest depauperate communities characterized the latest Ediacaran and provide the first quantitative support for the biotic replacement model for the end of the Ediacara biota. Although more sites (especially those recording different palaeoenvironments) are undoubtedly needed, this study provides the first quantitative palaeoecological evidence to suggest that evolutionary innovation, ecosystem engineering and biological interactions may have ultimately caused the first mass extinction of complex life.","We extend thanks to the Geological Survey of Namibia, and in particular Helke Mocke, Charlie Hoffmann, Roger Swart and Gabi Schneider for logistical help in conducting fieldwork.

However, most previous network analyses solely counted the number of links and ignored variation in link strength. Because of this crude resolution, results vary with scale and sampling intensity, thus hampering a comparison of network patterns at different levels . We applied a recently developed quantitative and scale-independent analysis based on information theory to 51 mutualistic plant-animal networks, with interaction frequency as measure of link strength. Most networks were highly structured, deviating significantly from random associations. The degree of specialization was independent of network size. Pollination webs were significantly more specialized than seed-dispersal webs, and obligate symbiotic ant-plant mutualisms were more specialized than nectar-mediated facultative ones. Across networks, the average specialization of animal and plants was correlated, but is constrained by the ratio of plant to animal species involved. In pollination webs, rarely visited plants were on average more specialized than frequently attended ones, whereas specialization of pollinators was positively correlated with their interaction frequency. We conclude that quantitative specialization in ecological communities mirrors evolutionary trade-offs and constraints of web architecture. This approach can be easily expanded to other types of biological interactions.","We thank D. Vázquez, K. Fiedler, and K.E.

There is debate centering on whether niche differentiation and local interactions among species are necessary to explain macroscopic community patterns or whether the patterns can be generated by the neutral interplay of dispersal and stochastic demography among ecologically identical species. Here we evaluate how much of the observed spatial variation within a rocky intertidal metacommunity along 800 km of coastline can be explained by drift in the structure of recruits across 15 local sites. Our results show that large spatial changes in recruitment do not explain the observed spatial variation in adult local structure and that, in comparison with the large drift in structure of recruits, local adult communities converged to a common, although not unique, structure across the region. Although there is no unique adult community structure in the entire region, the observed variation represents only a small subset of the possible structures that would be expected from passive recruitment drift. Thus, in this diverse system our results do not support the idea that rocky intertidal metacommunities are structured by neutral mechanisms.","We thank G. R. Finke, N. Godoy, M. Parragué, L.

The phytoplankton community generally originated from the coastal waters whereby species succession was mainly regulated by biological factors (life-cycle processes, species-specific physiological performances and inter-specific interactions). Physical factors, e.g. the alternation between coastal and offshore waters and the horizontal mixing, were also important drivers of phytoplankton dynamics promoting diversity maintenance by i) advecting species from offshore and ii) diluting the resident coastal community so as to dampen resource stripping by dominant species and thereby increase the numerical importance of rarer species. Our observations highlight the resilience of coastal communities, which may favour their persistence over time and the prevalence of successional events over small time and space scales. Although coastal systems may act differently from one another, our findings provide a conceptual framework to address physical–biological interactions occurring in coastal basins, which can be generalised to other areas.","This work is dedicated to the memory of the plankton ecologist Theodore J. ‘Ted’ Smayda, for his influential contribution in categorizing the underlying processes of phytoplankton dynamics.

We show that small increases in water temperature can alter the establishment success of the nonnative, tropical zooplankton species, Daphnia lumholtzi, and suggest a general framework for understanding species establishment in the context of climate change. We compared the establishment success of D. lumholtzi and the native congener D. pulex in a mesocosm experiment manipulating temperature, food conditions, and the identity of the resident vs. establishing species. To understand if our mesocosm results could have been predicted by thermal physiology, we characterized the thermal sensitivity of each species' population growth rate and estimated the temperatures at which each species would outperform the other. As predicted by the thermal sensitivities, invading D. lumholtzi were able to establish regardless of temperature and food resources, and established more rapidly in heated mesocosms. Invading D. pulex reached higher initial abundances in ambient-temperature mesocosms but failed to establish in any heated mesocosms. These findings suggest that thermal sensitivity may predict how altered interactions between species can influence community assembly, and that higher lake temperatures will likely aid the future establishment of nonnative D. lumholtzi in North America.","We thank M.

Conventional practices are well-established in the agroindustry as very efficient and lucrative; however, the increasing demand for sustainable alternatives has turned attention towards agroecological approaches. Here we intend to explore microbial dynamics according to the agricultural management used, based on the composition and structure of these bacterial communities on the most environmentally exposed habitat, the phyllosphere. Leaf samples were collected from a Citrus crop (cultivated Orange) in Mogi-Guaçu (SP, Brazil), where either conventional or ecological management systems were properly applied in two different areas. NGS sequencing analysis and quantitative PCR allowed us to comprehend the phyllosphere behavior and µ-XRF (micro X-ray fluorescence) could provide an insight on agrochemical persistence on foliar tissues. Our results demonstrate that there is considerable variation in the phyllosphere community due to the management practices used in the citrus orchard, and it was possible to quantify most of this variation. Equally, high copper concentrations may have influenced bacterial abundance, having a relevant impact on the differences observed. Moreover, we highlight the intricate relationship microorganisms have with crop production, and presumably with crop yield as well.","This work was supported by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development CNPq (No. 130400/2016-5) and by FAPESP’s Multiuser Equipment (Grant number 2015/19121-8 for the X-ray fluorescence microanalysis).

In this study, we evaluated the impact of parasitism by Proctoeces humboldti on the body size and reproduction of the intertidal keyhole limpet Fissurella crassa collected from three populations spanning ca. 1500 km along the latitudinal gradient of the Chilean coast. In addition, for the first time, we explore whether the effect of parasitism can be extended to changes in the organic composition and mechanical properties of the host shell. Our results show that parasitism prevalence and intensity, and body size of F. crassa increased in central Chile (ca. 33°S). Unlike body size, which was greater in parasitized limpets than in non-parasitized limpets at the three study sites, reproductive performance followed this trend only in central Chile populations, with no differences between parasitized and non-parasitized limpets collected in the northern Chilean (ca. 23°S), and lower in parasitized than non-parasitized individuals from the south-central Chile (ca. 37°S). The organic composition of F. crassa shells showed significant differences between parasite conditions (e.g. polysaccharides and water decreased in parasitized limpets) and across sites (e.g. proteins levels increase in shell of parasitized limpets from central Chile, but decreased at south-central Chile). However, variability in shell mechanical properties (e.g. toughness and elastic module) do not showed significant differences across sites and parasitism condition. These results suggest the interplay of both parasitism and environmental fluctuations upon the reproductive performance and morphology of the host. In addition, our result highlight that the host may also trade-offs reproduction, growth and shell organic composition to maintain the shell functionality (e.g. protection for mechanical forces and durophagous predators).","We thank Josue Navarrete and Antonia Moya (Chile), and Rocio Roman (Spain) for their valuable assistance during fieldwork and laboratory.

2380,pub.1146619453,10.1002/eap.2594,35343015,,,Do metapopulations and management matter for relict headwater bull trout populations in a warming climate?,"Mountain headwater streams have emerged as important climate refuges for native cold-water species due to their slow climate velocities and extreme physical conditions that inhibit non-native invasions. Species persisting in refuges often do so as fragmented, relict populations from broader historical distributions that are subject to ongoing habitat reductions and increasing isolation as climate change progresses. Key for conservation planning is determining where remaining populations will persist and how habitat restoration strategies can improve biological resilience to enhance the long-term prospects for species of concern. Studying bull trout, a headwater species in the northwestern USA, we developed habitat occupancy models using a data set of population occurrence in 991 natal habitat patches with a suite of novel geospatial covariates derived from high-resolution hydroclimatic scenarios and other sources representing watershed and instream habitat conditions, patch geometry, disturbance, and biological interactions. The best model correctly predicted bull trout occupancy status in 82.6% of the patches and included effects for: patch size estimated as habitat volume, extent of within-patch reaches <9°C mean August temperature, distance to nearest occupied patch, road density, invasive brook trout prevalence, patch slope, and frequency of high winter flows. The model was used to assess 16 scenarios of bull trout occurrence within the study streams that represented a range of restoration strategies under three climatic conditions (baseline, moderate change, and extreme change). Results suggested that regional improvements in bull trout status were difficult to achieve in realistic restoration strategies due to the pervasive nature of climate change and the limited extent of restoration actions given their high costs. However, occurrence probabilities in a subset of patches were highly responsive to restoration actions, suggesting that targeted investments to improve the resilience of some populations may be contextually beneficial. A possible strategy, therefore, is focusing effort on responsive populations near more robust population strongholds, thereby contributing to local enclaves where dispersal among populations further enhances resilience. Equally important, strongholds constituted a small numerical percentage of patches (5%-21%), yet encompassed the large majority of occupied habitat by volume (72%-89%) and their protection could have significant conservation benefits for bull trout.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Special thanks to the many fisheries biologists that provided information about the status of bull trout and brook trout in their management areas (Rick Wilkison, Phil Howell, Clayton Nalder, Scott Vuono, Herb Roerick, Caleb Zurstadt, Allison Russell, George Liknes, Robert Brassfield, Lisa Hawdon, Mike Jakober, Chris Kendall, Beth Gardner, Pat Van Eimeren, Paul Hooper, Joshua Schultze, and Shane Hendrickson).

However, mechanistic understanding of environmental controls of top predator size is poorly developed. We used streams to investigate how predator body size is altered by three fundamental climate change stressors: reductions in habitat size, increases in disturbance and warmer temperatures. Using new survey data from 74 streams, we showed that habitat size and disturbance were the most important stressors influencing predator body size. A synergistic interaction between that habitat size and disturbance due to flooding meant the sizes of predatory fishes peaked in large, benign habitats and their body size decreased as habitats became either smaller or harsher. These patterns were supported by experiments indicating that habitat-size reductions and increased flood disturbance decreased both the abundance and biomass of large predators. This research indicates that interacting climate change stressors can influence predator body size, resulting in smaller predators than would be predicted from examining an environmental factor in isolation. Thus, climate-induced changes to key interacting environmental factors are likely to have synergistic impacts on predator body size which, because of their influence on the strength of biological interactions, will have far-reaching effects on food-web responses to global environmental change.","We thank Darragh Woodford, Christa Jellyman, Hamish Greig, Kristy Hogsden, Brendan Coffey and Steven Lowe for their assistance with field surveys and experimental setup/design.

We investigated the impact of crustacean abundance and taxa diversity on mosquito oviposition and larval development. The effects of the biological larvicide Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) on mosquito larvae were monitored according to fluctuations in crustacean communities. Populations of the mosquito Culex pipiens colonized artificial ponds that contained crustacean communities at different time points of colonization by crustaceans: 1) 'no colonization' (no crustaceans), 2) 'simultaneous colonization' by crustaceans and mosquitoes, and 3) 'head-start colonization' by crustaceans (preceding colonization by mosquitoes). All types of ponds were treated with three concentrations of Bti (10, 100, or 1,000 µg/liter). Colonization of all ponds by Cx. pipiens (in terms of oviposition, larval abundance, and larval development) decreased significantly with increasing diversity of crustacean taxa. The total abundance of crustaceans had a minor effect on colonization by Cx. pipiens. The presence of crustaceans increased the sensitivity of Cx. pipiens larvae to Bti treatment by a factor of 10 and delayed the time of recolonization. This effect of Bti was relevant in the short term. In the long term, the presence of Cx. pipiens was determined by crustacean biodiversity.",We are grateful to our colleague Kaarina Foit at the Department of System Ecotoxicology for her indispensable help and support with the statistical analysis.

Because EH varies at multiple spatial scales, so too are microbial variables expected to vary. The determination of SD x EH interactions at multiple scales is, however, not a trivial exercise, especially when one examines their effects on microbial abundance and genomic similarities. Here we assessed those interactions at all scales perceptible in a patchy environment composed of known plant species and of heterogeneous soil physical and chemical parameters. For free-living, soil-borne Burkholderia ambifaria, genomic similarities responded to most of the spatial scales that the experimental sampling scheme could reveal, despite limited dispersal of the individuals. Species abundance and community composition were, however, responding to much smaller scales more consistent with local responses to EH. Our results suggest that whole-genome similarities may reflect the simultaneous effects of both SD and EH in microbial populations, but the pure effects of each factor only contributed to < 2% of the total genetic variation. The large amount of unexplained variation that remains after considering most environmental, spatial, and biological interactions is then posited to be the result of noise introduced by unmeasured environmental and spatial variability, sampling effects, and neutral ecological drift.","We thank Brendan J.

More specifically, we studied the interactions between copepods, diatoms and bacteria in relation to their effects on nitrate reduction and denitrification. Microcosms containing defaunated marine sediments were subjected to different treatments: an excess of nitrate, copepods, diatoms (Navicula sp.), a combination of copepods and diatoms, and spent medium from copepods. The microcosms were incubated for seven and a half days, after which nutrient concentrations and denitrification potential were measured. Ammonium concentrations were highest in the treatments with copepods or their spent medium, whilst denitrification potential was lowest in these treatments, suggesting that copepods enhance dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium over denitrification. We hypothesize that this is an indirect effect, by providing extra carbon for the bacterial community through the copepods' excretion products, thus changing the C/N ratio in favour of dissimilatory nitrate reduction. Diatoms alone had no effect on the nitrogen fluxes, but they did enhance the effect of copepods, possibly by influencing the quantity and quality of the copepods' excretion products. Our results show that small-scale biological interactions between bacteria, copepods and diatoms can have an important impact on denitrification and hence sediment nitrogen fluxes.","This research was conducted within the frame of research project GOA 01GA1911W of the Special Research Fund at Ghent University (BOF-UGent) on &quot;Understanding biodiversity effects on the functioning of marine benthic ecosystems&quot;.

Although the environments these communities inhabit range from coastal to open ocean waters, how the biological dynamics vary between such disparate habitats is not well known. To gain insight into the differential activities of microbial populations inhabiting different oceanic provinces we compared the daily metatranscriptome profiles of related microbial populations inhabiting surface waters of both a coastal California upwelling region (CC) as well as the oligotrophic North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG). Transcriptional networks revealed that the dominant photoautotrophic microbes in each environment (Ostreococcus in CC, Prochlorococcus in NPSG) were central determinants of overall community transcriptome dynamics. Furthermore, heterotrophic bacterial clades common to both ecosystems (SAR11, SAR116, SAR86, SAR406, and Roseobacter) displayed conserved, genome-wide inter- and intrataxon transcriptional patterns and diel cycles. Populations of SAR11 and SAR86 clades in particular exhibited tightly coordinated transcriptional patterns in both coastal and pelagic ecosystems, suggesting that specific biological interactions between these groups are widespread in nature. Our results identify common diurnally oscillating behaviors among diverse planktonic microbial species regardless of habitat, suggesting that highly conserved temporally phased biotic interactions are ubiquitous among planktonic microbial communities worldwide.","We thank B.

2335,pub.1030841059,10.1111/1462-2920.12300,24118804,,,Functional and phylogenetic marker for Nitrospira,"Nitrospira are the most widespread and diverse known nitrite-oxidizing bacteria and key nitrifiers in natural and engineered ecosystems. Nevertheless, their ecophysiology and environmental distribution are understudied because of the recalcitrance of Nitrospira to cultivation and the lack of a molecular functional marker, which would allow the detection of Nitrospira in the environment. Here we introduce nxrB, the gene encoding subunit beta of nitrite oxidoreductase, as a functional and phylogenetic marker for Nitrospira. Phylogenetic trees based on nxrB of Nitrospira were largely congruent to 16S ribosomal RNA-based phylogenies. By using new nxrB-selective polymerase chain reaction primers, we obtained almost full-length nxrB sequences from Nitrospira cultures, two activated sludge samples, and several geographically and climatically distinct soils. Amplicon pyrosequencing of nxrB fragments from 16 soils revealed a previously unrecognized diversity of terrestrial Nitrospira with 1801 detected species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (using an inferred species threshold of 95% nxrB identity). Richness estimates ranged from 10 to 946 coexisting Nitrospira species per soil. Comparison with an archaeal amoA dataset obtained from the same soils [Environ. Microbiol. 14: 525-539 (2012)] uncovered that ammonia-oxidizing archaea and Nitrospira communities were highly correlated across the soil samples, possibly indicating shared habitat preferences or specific biological interactions among members of these nitrifier groups.","We thank Michael Hannig, Jörg Overmann, Barbara Reinhold‐Hurek and Florian Hofhansl for sampling Namibian and Costa Rican soils, and Stefan Flechl, Sandra Hauzmayer, Brigitte Lechthaler, Jasmin Schwarz and Faris Behnam for technical support.

Parasitic plants may also influence community organization as parasite-host interactions may play a functional role in stress amelioration due to physiological mechanisms for salinity tolerance and resource acquisition. Endangered root hemiparasites (Cordylanthus maritimus ssp. palustris and Cordylanthus mollis ssp. mollis) occupy unique habitat within fragmented northern California tidal wetlands. My objective was to examine the effects of these root hemiparasites on soil salinity, aeration, and community composition. I compared experimentally established bare patches, shaded and unshaded, and parasite removal patches to controls with hemiparasites across intertidal elevation gradients. Plant community composition, soil salinity, and redox potential were measured as response variables. In this field removal experiment, I demonstrated that parasite-host associations can enhance the amelioration of physical stress conditions in the salt marsh exceeding the passive role of shading by vegetation. Consumer-driven reduction of physical stress resulted in increased plant species richness, and the effect was most pronounced with elevated salinity and hypoxia stress. Although previous studies have demonstrated that removal of dominant plant biomass by herbivores can increase physical stress in salt marshes, this is one of the first examples of a positive indirect effect of a consumer on community diversity through physical stress relief. Greater understanding of biological interactions coupled with abiotic factors may improve rare plant conservation and salt marsh restoration success.","I thank Megan Donahue, Mara Evans, Ted Grosholz, Eliška Rejmánková, Kevin Rice, and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on the manuscript.

2335,pub.1046503363,10.1111/ele.12431,25808325,,,Intrinsic dynamics of the regional community,"Patterns of diversity within large regional biotas express the outcomes of processes, operating on both regional and local scales, that influence evolutionary diversification as well as the distribution and abundance of species. Regional analyses of species distributions suggest that neither ecological sorting of species based on their adaptations to the physical environment, nor interactions between competing species, adequately explain patterns of species richness. Potentially competing species appear to utilise broadly overlapping resources with similar proficiency. Phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses reveal that species abundances and distributions within regions vary independently of evolutionary relationship. This implies the existence of dynamic, species-specific controls on population growth, as could be applied by specialised pathogens or other antagonists. Here, I argue that the changing balance of coevolved interactions between hosts and their antagonists shapes the distribution and abundance of individual host populations as well as patterns of local species richness. Geographical expansion creates allopatric populations and thereby could promote diversification; contraction ultimately leads to extinction. This taxon-cycle dynamic links regional diversity and distribution to intrinsic biological interactions independently of extrinsic ecological conditions. These hypotheses emphasise the central importance of investigating the impacts of pathogens on species abundance and distribution, and the potential consequences of coevolutionary changes in pathogen-host relationships for species formation and extinction.","For comments and discussion, I thank Ivan Jimenez, Jonathan Losos, Eliot Miller, Jonathan Myers, Susanne Renner, Christopher Trisos, several anonymous reviewers and the editors of Ecology Letters.

Previous studies have provided mixed evidence of population structure over regional and circumpolar scales. The aim of the present study was to test the recent population hypothesis for Antarctic silverfish, which emphasizes the interplay between life history and hydrography in shaping connectivity. A total of 1067 individuals were collected over 25 years from different locations on a circumpolar scale. Samples were genotyped at fifteen microsatellites to assess population differentiation and genetic structuring using clustering methods, F-statistics, and hierarchical analysis of variance. A lack of differentiation was found between locations connected by the Antarctic Slope Front Current (ASF), indicative of high levels of gene flow. However, gene flow was significantly reduced at the South Orkney Islands and the western Antarctic Peninsula where the ASF is absent. This pattern of gene flow emphasized the relevance of large-scale circulation as a mechanism for circumpolar connectivity. Chaotic genetic patchiness characterized population structure over time, with varying patterns of differentiation observed between years, accompanied by heterogeneous standard length distributions. The present study supports a more nuanced version of the genetic panmixia hypothesis that reflects physical-biological interactions over the life history.","We would like to thank Nils Koschnick (AWI) and Emilio Riginella (University of Padua) for collecting the 2012 AP and 2014 WS samples during ‘Polarstern’ ANT-XXVIII/4 and ANT-XXIX/9 cruises.

Primary productivity in the surface ocean is constrained by nutrients which are supplied, in part, by mixing with deeper water. Little is known about the time scales, frequency, or impact of mixing on microbial communities. We combined in situ sampling using the Environmental Sample Processor and a small-scale mixing experiment with lower euphotic zone water to determine how individual populations respond to mixing. Transcriptional responses were measured using the MicroTOOLs (Microbiological Targets for Ocean Observing Laboratories) microarray, which targets all three domains of life and viruses. The experiment showed that mixing substantially affects photosynthetic taxa as expected, but surprisingly also showed that populations respond differently to unfiltered deep water which contains particles (organisms and detritus) compared to filtered deep water that only contains nutrients and viruses, pointing to the impact of biological interactions associated with these events. Comparison between experimental and in situ population transcription patterns indicated that manipulated populations can serve as analogs for natural populations, and that natural populations may be frequently or continuously responding to nutrients from deeper waters. Finally, this study also shows that the microarray approach, which is complementary to metatranscriptomic sequencing, is useful for determining the physiological status of in situ microbial communities.","The authors would like to thank the Center for Microbial Oceanography, Research and Education (C-MORE grant number EF0424599, J.Z. and D.M.K.), the Simons Collaboration on Ocean Processes and Ecology (a grant from the Simons Foundation – SCOPE Award ID 329108, J.Z. and D.M.K.), the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation MEGAMER Facilities Grant (number 1761 to J.Z.) and Investigator Award (number 3794 to D.M.K.) and National Science Foundation Dimensions of Biodiversity Program (grant number 1241221, J.Z.) for funding and resources.

Microbial phototroph–heterotroph interactions propel the engine that results in the biogeochemical cycling of individual elements, and they are critical for understanding and modelling global ocean processes. Unfortunately, studies thus far have focused on exponentially growing cultures in nutrient-rich media, meaning knowledge of such interactions under in situ conditions is rudimentary at best. Here, we have performed long-term phototroph–heterotroph co-culture experiments under nutrient-amended and natural seawater conditions, and show that it is not the concentration of nutrients but rather their circulation that maintains a stable interaction and a dynamic system. Using the Synechococcus–Roseobacter interaction as a model phototroph–heterotroph case study, we show that although Synechococcus is highly specialized for carrying out photosynthesis and carbon fixation, it relies on the heterotroph to remineralize the inevitably leaked organic matter, making nutrients circulate in a mutualistic system. In this sense we challenge the general belief that marine phototrophs and heterotrophs compete for the same scarce nutrients and niche space, and instead suggest that these organisms more probably benefit from each other because of their different levels of specialization and complementarity within long-term stable-state systems.","This work was supported by a NERC Independent Research Fellowship NE/K009044/1, a UK Synthetic Biology Research Centre grant from EPSRC and BBSRC (BB/M017982/1), the EU FP7 project MaCuMBA (grant 311975) and the Commissariat à l&#x27;Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives.

The exquisite preservation of the organisms documents an ancient biodiversity that also includes various levels of biological interaction. Absent from the picture until recently has been detailed information about the development of the gametophyte phase and the alternation of generations of the macroplants in this ecosystem. Here, we trace the development of the gametophyte phase of Aglaophyton, an early land plant with an unusual complement of structural and morphological characters. Mature gametophytes consist of a fleshy protocorm attached to the substrate by basal rhizoids; arising from the upper surface are one to several upright gametangiophores bearing multiple gametangia. Stomata are present on the upper surface of the protocorm and gametangiophore, and endomycorrhizal fungi extend throughout the gametophyte. Gametophytes are unisexual, producing either antheridiophores or archegoniophores. There is no evidence that gametophytes later become hermaphroditic. The sexual dimorphism of the Rhynie chert gametophytes is inconsistent with theoretical ideas about the haploid phase of early land plants. The gametophyte phase of early land plants can now be considered within an ecological and evolutionary framework that, in turn, can be used to develop hypotheses about some aspects of the population dynamics and growth of these early land plants.","We thank Drs.

Here, we provide a scientific tribute to Steele focusing on, by means of example, his modelling of plankton predation [Steele and Henderson (1992) The role of predation in plankton models. J. Plankton Res., 14, 157-172] that showed that differences in ecosystem dynamics between the subarctic Pacific and North Atlantic oceans can be explained solely on the basis of zooplankton mortality. The study highlights Steele's artistry in simplifying the system to a tractable minimal model while paying great attention to the precise functional forms used to parameterize mortality, grazing and other biological processes. The success of this and other works by Steele was in large part due to his effective communication with the rest of the scientific community (especially non-modellers) resulting from his enthusiasm, use of an experiment-like (hypothesis driven) approach to applying his models and by describing simplifications and assumptions in scrupulous detail.

The authors present a framework that links common ecotoxicological endpoints to chemical impacts on populations and communities and the ecosystem services that they provide. This framework builds on considerable advances in mechanistic effects models designed to span multiple levels of biological organization and account for various types of biological interactions and feedbacks. For illustration, the authors introduce 2 case studies that employ well-developed and validated mechanistic effects models: the inSTREAM individual-based model for fish populations and the AQUATOX ecosystem model. They also show how dynamic energy budget theory can provide a common currency for interpreting organism-level toxicity. They suggest that a framework based on mechanistic models that predict impacts on ecosystem services resulting from chemical exposure, combined with economic valuation, can provide a useful approach for informing environmental management. The authors highlight the potential benefits of using this framework as well as the challenges that will need to be addressed in future work.

I investigated patterns of actuarial senescence in a sample of 169 species of birds in relation to latitude and migration, by analysing longevity records adjusted for sampling effort, survival rate and body mass. Senescence might decrease at low latitudes because of elevated adult survival rates and generally slow life histories. Alternatively, the rate of senescence might increase at low latitudes because of the greater impact of biological interactions such as parasitism, predation and competition on fitness through differential effects of age-specific mortality (e.g. because immunologically naïve young individuals and immuno-senescent old individuals might die more frequently than individuals belonging to intermediate age classes). Bird migration entails extensive exercise twice annually, with migrants spending more time in benign environments with little abiotic mortality than residents, migrants having higher adult survival rate and lower annual fecundity than residents, and migrants suffering more from the consequences of oxidative stress than residents. The rate of senescence increased with latitude, as expected because of slow life histories at low latitudes. Independently, rate of senescence decreased with increasing migration distance. These findings were robust to control for potentially confounding effects of body mass, age of first reproduction and phenotypic similarity among species because of common descent.",I thank C.

Liebl). Forty-five samples with replicates of eight leaves per sample were collected in spring, summer and autumn. Bacterial community diversity was analyzed via Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA). The leaf traits specific leaf area, level of herbivory, stomatal number, stomatal length, carbon and nitrogen concentration were measured for the leaves of each sample. For statistical analysis, linear mixed effect models, the Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Non-Parametric Multivariate Analysis of Variance (NPMANOVA) were applied. Herbivory, nitrogen and carbon concentration were significantly different in autumn compared to spring and summer (p value < 0.05), while stomatal length was differentiated between spring and the other two seasons (p value < 0.01). The seasonal differentiation of the bacterial community structure was explained by the first and second axes (29.7% and 25.3%, respectively) in the CCA. The bacterial community structure significantly correlated with herbivory, nitrogen concentration and stomatal length. We conclude that herbivory, nitrogen content, and size of stomatal aperture at the leaf level are important for endophyte colonization in oaks growth in alpine forest environments.","This work was supported by the project “Effects of forest aerial fertilization on the microbial communities of coniferous tree phyllosphere, residuosphere and rhizosphere –MICRONITRAIR” (CUP: I52I13000180005).

In Geranium sylvaticum, females produce more seeds per flower than hermaphrodites. This difference in seed production might be modified by biological interactions with pollinators and herbivores that may favour one sex and thus affect the maintenance of gynodioecy.
METHODS: Sexual dimorphism in flower size and flowering phenology, and in attractiveness to pollinators, pre-dispersal seed predators and floral herbivores were examined in natural populations of G. sylvaticum.
KEY RESULTS: Pollinators preferred hermaphrodites 25 % more often than females in two of the three study populations, and floral herbivores attacked hermaphrodites 15 % more often than females in two of the six study populations. These preferences might be explained by the larger flower size of hermaphrodites. In contrast, seed predators did not prefer either sex.
CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that pollinator preference does not benefit females, whereas the higher floral herbivory of hermaphrodites might enhance the maintenance of females in G. sylvaticum. Thus, although the data support the view that ecological factors may contribute to the maintenance of gynodioecy, they also suggest that these contributions may vary across populations and that they may function in opposite directions.",,,Annals of Botany,,Oxford University Press (OUP),"0305-7364, 1095-8290","Adaptation, Physiological; Analysis of Variance; Flowers; Geranium; Pollen; Reproduction; Seeds; Sex Characteristics",2005-02-08,2005,2005-02-08,2005-04,95,5,879-886,All OA; Bronze,Article,"ASIKAINEN, EIJA; MUTIKAINEN, PIA","ASIKAINEN, EIJA (For correspondence.

Differences in this intraspecific diversity can have important consequences for contemporary ecological dynamics, but the direction and magnitude of these effects appear inconsistent across studies and systems. Here we proposed and tested the hypothesis that context-dependent ecological effects of altering phenotypic variance are predictable and arise from the relationship between a population's mean phenotype and the local environmental optimum. By factorially manipulating the mean and variance of a key host trait in environments with and without a lethal parasite, we demonstrate that increasing phenotypic variance can have beneficial effects for host populations (e.g., smaller disease epidemics) but only when the population's initial phenotype was poorly matched to the local environment. When phenotypes were initially well suited to environmental conditions, in contrast, greater phenotypic variance led to larger disease epidemics. Significant reductions in individual susceptibility occurred in both contexts over time, but the mechanisms leading to those reductions differed; strong selection was caused by either a suboptimal trait mean and insufficient trait variance or a near-optimal trait mean and too much trait variance. Increasing intraspecific variation is clearly not always beneficial for populations, instead producing predictable ecological and evolutionary effects that depend on environmental context and biological interactions.",,,The American Naturalist,,University of Chicago Press,"0003-0147, 1537-5323",Animals; Daphnia; Genetic Variation; Host-Parasite Interactions; Life History Traits; Metschnikowia; Phenotype,2019-05-22,2019,2019-05-22,2019-07,194,1,47-58,Closed,Article,"Dibble, Christopher J; Rudolf, Volker H W","Dibble, Christopher J (); Rudolf, Volker H W ()",,"Dibble, Christopher J (); Rudolf, Volker H W ()",,,,,,,,,,,8,4,0.27,1.93,15,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1113203768,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,2.1 Biological and endogenous factors,,,A05 Biological Sciences,

In both genera apomicts have a wider geographical distribution than sexuals, illustrating the short-term ecological success of apomixis. Allozymes and DNA markers indicate that apomictic populations are highly polyclonal. In Taraxacum, clonal diversity can be generated by rare hybridization between sexuals and apomicts, the latter acting as pollen donors. Less extensive clonal diversity is generated by mutations within clonal lineages. Clonal diversity may be maintained by frequency-dependent selection, caused by biological interactions (e.g. competitors and pathogens). Some clones are geographically widespread and probably represent phenotypically plastic 'general-purpose genotypes'. The long-term evolutionary success of apomictic clones may be limited by lack of adaptive potential and the accumulation of deleterious mutations. Although apomictic clones may be considered as 'evolutionary dead ends', the genes controlling apomixis can escape from degeneration and extinction via pollen in crosses between sexuals and apomicts. In this way, apomixis genes are transferred to a new genetic background, potentially adaptive and cleansed from linked deleterious mutations. Consequently, apomixis genes can be much older than the clones they are currently contained in. The close phylogenetic relationship between Taraxacum and Chondrilla and the similarity of their apomixis mechanisms suggest that apomixis in these two genera could be of common ancestry.",,,Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B Biological Sciences,,The Royal Society,"0962-8436, 1471-2970","Asteraceae; Biological Evolution; Ecology; Environment; Genetic Variation; Meiosis; Pollen; Population Dynamics; Reproduction, Asexual",2003-06-29,2003,2003-06-29,2003-06-29,358,1434,1113-1121,All OA; Green,Article,"van Dijk, Peter J.","van Dijk, Peter J.

While interactions based on early Gondwanan vicariance have been used to explain present day lineage distributions, several recent studies have instead inferred dispersal across the IOB. This inference is often advanced because lineages under study have species inhabiting IOB islands. Here we examine the roles of continental vicariance vs. trans-IOB dispersal in the distribution of an avian genus found around the perimeter of the IOB. A molecular phylogeny does reveal evidence of a relationship that would require the inference of trans-IOB dispersal between eastern Africa and Sri Lanka. However, molecular clock data, ancestral area analyses and paleoclimatic reconstructions suggest that vicariance related to tropical forest expansion and retraction is more likely to have facilitated African-Asian interchange, with an initial colonization of Africa from Asia quickly followed by a recolonization of Asia. Subsequent dispersal from Asia to Sri Lanka and islands east of the Sunda Shelf are inferred; these latter islands were colonized in a stepping-stone fashion that culminated in colonization of the Sunda Shelf, and a recolonization of mainland Asia. We propose that circum-IOB distributions, which post-date early Gondwanan breakup, are most likely the result of continent-based vicariant events, particularly those events related to large-scale habitat alterations, and not trans-IOB dispersals.",We thank the Curators and staff of those museums that provided us with samples.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Within the context of trophic cascades, various treatments using in situ mesocosms were established in a closed estuary to highlight the importance of predation in stabilizing estuarine plankton abundances. Through either the removal (filtration) or addition of certain planktonic groups, five different trophic systems were established. These treatments contained varied numbers of trophic levels and thus different ""predators"" at the top of the food chain. The abundances of zooplankton (copepod and polychaete), ciliate, micro-flagellate, nano-flagellate and bacteria were investigated in each treatment, over time. The reference treatment containing apex zooplanktivores (early juvenile mullet) and plankton at natural densities mimicked a natural, stable state of an estuary. Proportional variability (PV) and coefficient of variation (CV) of temporal abundances were calculated for each taxon and showed that apex predators in this experimental ecosystem, when compared to the other systems, induced stability. The presence of these predators therefore had consequences for multiple trophic levels, consistent with trophic cascade theory.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: PV and CV proved useful indices for comparing stability. Apex predators exerted a stabilizing pressure through feeding on copepods and polychaetes which cascaded through the ciliates, micro-flagellates, nano-flagellates and bacteria. When compared with treatments without apex predators, the role of predation in structuring planktonic communities in closed estuaries was highlighted.","Funding for this project was provided by the Rhodes University science focus grant.

This is because any extrapolation towards landscape-level effects encounters considerable uncertainties: (i) when proceeding from the level of individual single-species tests to populations and communities, biological interactions are not considered; (ii) from mesocosms to field communities, environmental factors and stressors that determine the effects of pesticides in the field are not considered; and (iii) most monitoring investigations are restricted spatially and do not consider recolonisation, and lack an adequate means of distinguishing confounding factors from natural variation. We advocate using species traits as community descriptors, to determine quantitative links between pesticide toxicity and community alterations. Recently, a trait-based indicator system was developed to identify SPEcies At Risk (SPEAR) of being affected by pesticides, with reference to life-history and physiological traits. This SPEAR system has now been successfully employed to link pesticide exposure and effects in Finland, France and Germany. The effect of pesticides on the structure of communities described with SPEAR was independent of the biogeographical region. We then extrapolated and visualised the anticipated risk for aquatic communities in small agricultural streams within Europe in a risk map. With this information we identified a potential risk from pesticide runoff in a high proportion of streams. By focusing on the ecological effect of selected environmental factors, trait-based approaches offer an increased realism for risk assessment of toxicants on the ecosystem level.",,,The Science of The Total Environment,,Elsevier,"0048-9697, 1879-1026",Animals; Environmental Pollutants; Pesticides; Risk Assessment; Species Specificity,2008-07-24,2008,2008-07-24,2008-12,406,3,484-490,Closed,Article,"Liess, Matthias; Schäfer, Ralf B.; Schriever, Carola A.","Liess, Matthias (UFZ - Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research, Department of System Ecotoxicology, Permoser Straße 15, 04318 Leipzig, Germany); Schäfer, Ralf B.

The presence of a toxic strain of M. aeruginosa was confirmed through the use of ELISA and molecular markers that detect the presence of the mcyB and mcyD genes of the mcy gene cluster that synthesizes microcystin. An increase in Microcystis toxicity at sites dominated by the cyanobacterial scum was accompanied by an increase in total abundance of the macroinvertebrate families Hirudinae, Chironomidae, and Tubificidae. Sites located away from the cyanobacterial scum had a lower abundance but a higher diversity of macroinvertebrates. The water quality under the Microcystis scum was characterized by low pH values, low concentrations of dissolved oxygen, and lower total alkalinity values. The periphytic alga Ulothrix zonata was absent in areas dominated by the cyanobacterial scum, possibly as a result of overshadowing by the scum or direct toxic allelopathic effects on growth and photosynthesis.

We describe the bacterial diversity of the coralloid roots from seven Dioon species and their surrounding rhizosphere and soil. Using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we found that all coralloid roots are inhabited by a broad diversity of bacterial groups, including cyanobacteria and Rhizobiales among the most abundant groups. The diversity and composition of the endophytes are similar in the six Mexican species of Dioon that we evaluated, suggesting a recent divergence of Dioon populations and/or similar plant-driven restrictions in maintaining the coralloid root microbiome. Botanical garden samples and natural populations have a similar taxonomic composition, although the beta diversity differed between these populations. The rhizosphere surrounding the coralloid root serves as a reservoir and source of mostly diazotroph and plant growth-promoting groups that colonize the coralloid endosphere. In the case of cyanobacteria, the endosphere is enriched with Nostoc spp and Calothrix spp that are closely related to previously reported symbiont genera in cycads and other early divergent plants. The data reported here provide an in-depth taxonomic characterization of the bacterial community associated with coralloid root microbiome. The functional aspects of the endophytes, their biological interactions, and their evolutionary history are the next research step in this recently discovered diversity within the cycad coralloid root microbiome.","We are grateful to Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT; www.conacyt.mx) award 169701 and FON.INST./265/2016 (901) to ACJ; CONACyT award 285746 to FBG and CONACYT 242938 to PJSM.

2268,pub.1037317617,10.1007/pl00008863,28308767,,,Carbon and nitrogen isotopes trace nutrient exchange in an ant-plant mutualism,"Abstract Mutualisms, biological interactions from which each species benefits, are thought to be evolutionarily stable only under a limited set of circumstances. Underlying all mutualisms is an intrinsic conflict between the parties, in that each is under selection to further exploit the other. Conflict between mutualists will lead to instability unless each species receives a net benefit from the interaction. To understand how mutualisms persist, then, it is essential to document the exact nature of the interaction. The relationship between Cecropia trees and Azteca ants has been a model for the study of mutualism since its description more than 100 years ago. Ants live in Cecropia’s hollow stems and harvest specialized food bodies produced by the host. In return, ants defend the plant from leaf-feeding herbivores and encroaching vegetation. Central to modeling this relationship is understanding the exchange of nutrients between symbionts. Here we present evidence that the flow of nutrients has been misjudged. Although ants consume plant products, they provide more nutrients than they receive. Using stable isotope analysis, we calculate that only about 18% of worker ant carbon is derived from Cecropia, whereas 93% of the nitrogen in ant-occupied host plants is derived from debris deposited by ants. Ants rely on sources other than their host for food and, in doing so, make a rich source of nitrogen available to the host.",,,Oecologia,,Springer Nature,"0029-8549, 1432-1939",,2000-06,2000,,2000-06,123,4,582-586,Closed,Article,"Sagers, C.

Several attempts have been made to relate these to climatic cycles. We use advanced time series analysis methods to attribute cyclicities in several North-American mammal species to abiotic vs. biotic factors.ResultsWe study eleven century-long time series of fur-count s and three climatic records – the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the El-Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and Northern Hemisphere (NH) temperatures – that extend over the same time interval. Several complementary methods of spectral analysis are applied to these 14 times series, singly or jointly. These spectral analyses were applied to the leading principal components (PCs) of the data sets. The use of both PC analysis and spectral analysis helps distinguish external from intrinsic factors that influence the dynamics of the mammal populations.ConclusionsOur results show that all three climatic indices influence the animal-population dynamics: they explain a substantial part of the variance in the fur-counts and share characteristic periods with the fur-count data set. In addition to the climate-related periods, the fur-count time series also contain a significant 3-year period that is, in all likelihood, caused by biological interactions.","This work was initiated as part of a collaboration between the Ecole Normale Supérieure and UCLA.

An understanding of red coral population structure, particularly larval dispersal patterns and connectivity among harvested populations is paramount to the viability of the species. In order to determine patterns of genetic spatial structuring of deep water Corallium rubrum populations, for the first time, colonies found between 58-118 m depth within the Tyrrhenian Sea were collected and analyzed. Ten microsatellite loci and two regions of mitochondrial DNA (mtMSH and mtC) were used to quantify patterns of genetic diversity within populations and to define population structuring at spatial scales from tens of metres to hundreds of kilometres. Microsatellites showed heterozygote deficiencies in all populations. Significant levels of genetic differentiation were observed at all investigated spatial scales, suggesting that populations are likely to be isolated. This differentiation may by the results of biological interactions, occurring within a small spatial scale and/or abiotic factors acting at a larger scale. Mitochondrial markers revealed significant genetic structuring at spatial scales greater then 100 km showing the occurrence of a barrier to gene flow between northern and southern Tyrrhenian populations. These findings provide support for the establishment of marine protected areas in the deep sea and off-shore reefs, in order to effectively maintain genetic diversity of mesophotic red coral populations.","This study is part of a research project “Study of red coral deep dwelling populations: structure, demography and genetics” supported by a grant form the Italian Ministry of Environment and by an Assegno di Ricerca of the University of Bologna to FC.

In fact, it is hard to find an area of biology where these concepts are not used. However, quantifying the information transferred in biological interactions has been difficult. How much information is transferred when the first spring rainfall hits a dormant seed, or when a chick begs for food from its parent? One measure that is commonly used in such cases is fitness value: by how much, on average, an individual's fitness would increase if it behaved optimally with the new information, compared to its average fitness without the information. Another measure, often used to describe neural responses to sensory stimuli, is the mutual information-a measure of reduction in uncertainty, as introduced by Shannon in communication theory. However, mutual information has generally not been considered to be an appropriate measure for describing developmental or behavioral responses at the organismal level, because it is blind to function; it does not distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information. In this paper we show that there is in fact a surprisingly tight connection between these two measures in the important context of evolution in an uncertain environment. In this case, a useful measure of fitness benefit is the increase in the long-term growth rate, or the fold increase in number of surviving lineages. We show that in many cases the fitness value of a developmental cue, when measured this way, is exactly equal to the reduction in uncertainty about the environment, as described by the mutual information.","This work was supported in part by a UW RRF award to CTB and was initiated during a visit to the H.

Ischnura hastata is the only known example of natural parthenogenesis within the insect order Odonata, and it represents also a typical example of geographic parthenogenesis, as sexual populations are widely distributed in North America, whereas parthenogenetic populations of this species have only been found at the Azores archipelago. In order to gain insight in the origin and distribution of parthenogenetic I. hastata lineages, we have used microsatellites, mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence data, to examine the population genetic structure of this species over a wide geographic area. Our results suggest that sexual populations of I. hastata in North America conform to a large subdivided population that has gone through a recent spatial expansion. A recent single long distance dispersal event, followed by a demographic expansion, is the most parsimonious hypothesis explaining the origin of the parthenogenetic population of this species in the Azores islands.","This work was supported by a research grant of the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science to ACR, which included FEDER funds (CGL2005-00122 and CGL2008-02799) and a predoctoral grant to MOLC.

We argue that this is due to inappropriate methods used to forecast required compensation in environmental impact assessments. These assessments are mostly descriptive and only valid at limited spatial and temporal scales. However, habitat suitability models developed to predict the impacts of environmental changes on potential species' distributions should provide rigorous science-based tools for compensation planning. Here we describe the two main classes of predictive models: correlative models and individual-based mechanistic models. We show how these models can be used alone or synoptically to improve compensation planning. While correlative models are easier to implement, they tend to ignore underlying ecological processes and lack accuracy. On the contrary, individual-based mechanistic models can integrate biological interactions, dispersal ability and adaptation. Moreover, among mechanistic models, those considering animal energy balance are particularly efficient at predicting the impact of foraging habitat loss. However, mechanistic models require more field data compared to correlative models. Hence we present two approaches which combine both methods for compensation planning, especially in relation to the spatial scale considered. We show how the availability of biological databases and software enabling fast and accurate population projections could be advantageously used to assess ecological compensation requirement efficiently in environmental impact assessments.","We thank Vincent Devictor and two reviewers for constructive comments on the manuscript.

The first Laboulbeniales parasitizing the millipede order Chordeumatida (Diplopoda) were discovered and described as a new dioecious genus of Laboulbeniales, Thaxterimyces, to accommodate the new species T. baliensis. Also the millipede host is a new species and is described as Metopidiothrix sheari. This is the first time Laboulbeniales fungus and its millipede host are described as new together. Males of Metopidiothrix have the most extensive secondary sexual modifications in the entire class Diplopoda. Although nothing is known about the function of these modifications, the unique pattern of Laboulbeniales infection in the new millipede species is obviously related to host sexual behavior. Rotational Scanning Electron Micrographs (rSEM) are used to create a 3D comprehensive model to examine the fungal-host interaction, a more advanced visualization of the ectoparasitic fungus on its host. Laboulbeniales diversity on millipedes is still understudied, and a consistent effort is needed to unveil and understand the extent and diversity of this biological interaction. Due to their minute size and apparently non-detrimental effect on their hosts, Laboulbeniales in general have been largely ignored by mycologists and neglected by generations of entomologists. As a result a significant component of global biodiversity has been strongly underestimated, and a wealth of new discoveries is still to be made both in the field and in existing museum collections.","Funded by 1.

Interaction strengths between organisms are likely to change along with environmental changes, given interspecific heterogeneity in responses to physico-chemical variables. Biological interaction outcomes have the potential to alter food web production and trophic level biomass distribution. This is particularly pertinent for key species that are either abundant or play disproportionately large roles in ecosystem processes. Using a functional response approach, we quantified the effects of shifting temperatures on interactions between key mysid species-sympatric in their distribution across a biogeographic transition zone along the east coast of South Africa. The Rhopalophthalmus terranatalis functional response type toward Mesopodopsis wooldridgei prey was independent of temperature, with all treatments producing Type II functional responses. Temperature effects on predator-prey dynamics were, however, evident as interaction strength was greatest at 21 °C, as measured by maximum feeding rates. Unlike maximum feeding rate, attack rates increased linearly with increasing temperature across the experimental treatments. Our findings suggest that interaction strength between the mysid shrimp species is likely to vary spatially along the current length of their sympatric distribution and temporally in certain regions where temperatures are projected to change. Such experimental interaction investigations are becoming increasingly important given our relatively poor understanding of the consequences of environmental change for effects on interactions among species and their wider ecosystem implications.","We acknowledge use of infrastructure and equipment provided by the SAIAB Research Platform and Rhodes University.

Our understanding of ecological communities cannot advance if we do not distinguish larger scale processes from smaller ones. Variability at small spatial scales can be important because it carries information about biological interactions, which cannot be explained by environmental heterogeneity alone. Marine fouling communities are shaped by both the supply of larvae and competition for resources among colonizers-these two processes operate on distinctly different scales. Here, we demonstrate how fouling community structure varies with spatial scale in a temperate Australian environment, and we identify the spatial scale that captures the most variability. Community structure was quantified with both univariate (species richness and diversity) and multivariate (similarity in species composition) indices. Variation in community structure was unevenly distributed between the spatial scales that we examined. While variation in community structure within patch was usually greater than among patch, variation among patch was always significant. Opportunistic taxa that rely heavily on rapid colonization of free space spread more evenly among patches during early succession. In contrast, taxa that are strong adult competitors but slow colonizers spread more evenly among patches only during late succession. Our findings show significant patchiness can develop in a habitat showing no systematic environmental spatial variation, and this patchiness can be mediated through different biological factors at different spatial scales.",Acknowledgments We thank Blairgowrie Yacht Squadron for providing access to the marina.

However, the cumulative insect herbivory plants experience under natural conditions complicates predictions about tolerance contributions to net fitness. Apical damage can lead to compensatory seed production from late season flowering that ameliorates early season fitness losses. Yet, the compensation realized depends on successful development and herbivore escape by later season flowers. Using monocarpic perennial Cirsium canescens, we quantified seed-reproductive fitness of plants with vs. without experimental damage to the early-developing large apical flower head, with and without a 30–40% herbivory reduction on subsequent flower heads, for two flowering cohorts. Plants with reduced herbivory clearly demonstrated the release of apical dominance and compensation, not overcompensation, for apical damage via greater seed maturation by later flower heads. In contrast, plants that experienced ambient herbivory levels on subsequent heads undercompensated for early apical damage. Individuals had lower total seed set when the apical head was damaged. Compensation was, therefore, possible through a small increase in total flower heads, caused by a higher rate of floral bud survival, and a higher seed maturation rate by subsequent heads, leading to more viable seeds per matured flower head. With ambient cumulative floral herbivory, compensation for apical damage was not sufficient to improve fitness. Variation in the intensity of biological interactions played a role in the success of plant tolerance as a mechanism to maximize individual fitness.",,,Oecologia,,Springer Nature,"0029-8549, 1432-1939",Animals; Cirsium; Flowers; Herbivory; Insecta; Plants,2017-12-07,2017,2017-12-07,2018-02,186,2,495-506,All OA; Green,Article,"West, Natalie M.; Louda, Svata M.","West, Natalie M.

As voracious predators of plankton, ctenophores have key positions in aquatic food webs and are often successful invaders when introduced to new areas. Gelatinous zooplankton have strong impacts on ecosystem services, particularly in coastal environments. However, little is known about the factors responsible for regulating population dynamics of gelatinous organisms, including biological interactions that may contribute to bloom demise. Ctenophores are known to contain specific bacterial communities and a variety of invertebrate parasites and symbionts; however, no previous studies have examined the presence of viruses in these organisms. Building upon recent studies demonstrating a diversity of single-stranded DNA viruses that encode a replication initiator protein (Rep) in aquatic invertebrates, this study explored the presence of circular, Rep-encoding single-stranded DNA (CRESS-DNA) viruses in the ctenophores Mnemiopsis leidyi and Beroe ovata collected from the Skidaway River Estuary and Savannah River in Georgia, USA. Using rolling circle amplification followed by restriction enzyme digestion, this study provides the first evidence of viruses in ctenophores. Investigation of four CRESS-DNA viruses over an 8-month period using PCR demonstrated temporal trends in viral prevalence and indicated that some of the viruses may persist in ctenophore populations throughout the year. Although future work needs to examine the ecological roles of these ctenophore-associated viruses, this study indicates that viral infection may play a role in population dynamics of gelatinous zooplankton.","This work was funded through grant DEB-1239976 from the National Science Foundation&#x27;s Assembling the Tree of Life Program to KR and MB; SF, and CG were funded through the REU supplement DEB-1415830 to MB.

I provide a quantitative model that integrates these factors. I use the model to predict profitability of fruits to tropical birds, but the model and its predictions are applicable to a wider array of systems and organisms. Profitability of a fruit is determined by rewards provided by the pericarp (mass and caloric yields) relative to costs (metabolic requirements, handling time, search time, behavioral interference, predator avoidance) associated with finding and eating that fruit (Fig. 1). Fruits increase in profitability with increases in fruit size until increases in handling time offset increases in pericarp mass. The fruit size at which increases in handling time offset increases in pericarp mass varies among bird species due to differences in bill and body size. Decreases in feeding rate due to decreasing numbers of fruits and increasing search time causes reduced profitability and this effect becomes more severe with decreasing fruit size and/or increasing frugivore size. Consequently, as fruit size decreases relative to frugivore size, fruit abundance becomes increasingly important to fruit selection by frugivores. However, while profitability of resources is a function of characteristics of the resources and the organisms, biological interactions can change profitability rankings; resources that may be more profitable in the absence of behavioral interference, exploitation competition, or predation risk can become less profitable in the face of these interactions. The proposed model integrates these interactions to provide predictions of resource selection and these predictions are supported by published studies.",,,Oecologia,,Springer Nature,"0029-8549, 1432-1939",,1985-07,1985,,1985-07,66,4,563-573,Closed,Article,"Martin, Thomas E.","Martin, Thomas E.

Trematode parasites often impact their hosts by inducing parasitic castration, frequently correlated with increased body size in the host (i.e., gigantism hypothesis), which is postulated to reflect the re-allocation of energy released by the reduction in the reproductive process. In this study, we compared the effect of a trematode species on shell size and morphology in adult individuals of the intertidal mussels Perumytilus purpuratus (>20 mm) collected from two local populations of contrasting environmental regimes experienced in central-southern Chile. Our field data indicates that in both study locations, parasitized mussels evidenced higher body sizes (shell length, total weight and volume) as compared with non-parasitized. In addition, parasitized mussels from the southern location evidenced thinner shells than non-parasitized ones and those collected from central Chile, suggesting geographical variation in shell carbonate precipitation across intertidal habitats of the Chilean coast. In laboratory conditions, mussels collected from a local population in central Chile were exposed to two temperature treatments (12 and 18 °C). Parasitized mussels showed higher growth rates than non-parasitized, regardless of the seawater temperature treatments. However, the metabolic rate was not influenced by the parasite condition or the temperature treatments. Our field and laboratory results support the parasite-induced gigantism hypothesis, and suggest that both the thermal environment and geographic location explain only a portion of the increased body size, while the parasitic condition is the most plausible factor modulating the outcome of this host-parasite interaction.","We thank Josue Navarrete and Antonia Moya for their valuable assistance during laboratory and fieldwork.

2207,pub.1040039909,10.1093/jme/tju062,26336301,,,Interspecific Larval Competition Differentially Impacts Adult Survival in Dengue Vectors,"Mosquitoes often experience intraspecific and interspecific competition among larvae attributable to high densities and nutrient limitation, especially container mosquitoes including Aedes aegypti (L.) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse). Density-dependent effects on larvae impact adult production and adult traits that influence transmission of arboviruses. To improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which density-dependence influences transmission and identify species-specific traits, we tested the hypotheses: 1) Competitive asymmetry in favor of Ae. albopictus over Ae. aegypti translates to altered adult female survival, and 2) Ae. aegypti adult females are more resistant to life-shortening effects of low-humidity conditions than Ae. albopictus. We gauged the relative impact of inter- and intraspecific larval competition on adult survival in high- and low-humidity regimes (77 and 44% relative humidity, respectively). For Ae. albopictus, intraspecific but not interspecific competition usually reduced adult survival under both humidity regimes. For Ae. aegypti, both intraspecific and interspecific competition reduced adult survival. Ae. albopictus adult survival was minimally influenced by interspecific competition with Ae. aegypti, consistent with observations that Ae. albopictus is the superior competitor. A species comparison indicated that Ae. aegypti exhibited a survival advantage relative to Ae. albopictus under both low- and high-humidity conditions. However, similar survival of these Aedes species was observed in some cases depending on conditions experienced in both the aquatic and terrestrial environments. These results demonstrate plasticity in survival rates of dengue and chikungunya vectors and the significance of considering the influence of biological interactions during the immature stages and abiotic conditions during the adult stage.","We thank N.D.

Safety assessment is based on results gained from organisms adapted to lentic systems and biological interactions in ecosystems are neglected. While lotic communities are often at first in contact with chemicals, it is astonishing that microcosms with lentic communities are mainly used as a bridge between laboratory bioassays and outdoor aquatic systems. Hence, we established five artificial indoor streams to simulate abiotic factors of small rivers. The closed-circuit system was filled with nutrients added to tap water. Washed pebbles were used as sediment. The dynamics of a simple biocoenoses consisting of aufwuchs,Lumbriculus variegatus Asellus aquaticus andGammarus fossarum was investigated. The dynamic of aufwuchs and periphyton was determined as dry weight and chlorophyll-a, respectively and qualitatively by pigment pattern. The abundance of different developmental stages ofL. variegatus was determined at the end of the experiment as well as the population dynamics ofG. fossarum andA. aquaticus. Survival rates of gammarids and juveniles per female were investigated and data were used for modelling the population dynamics. The experiment was carried out to investigate the performance of the established artificial streams and the developed approaches to investigate effects of chemicals on a basic lotic community. The prime reason to establish this approach was to close a gap between complex artificial stream systems and laboratory single species tests to assess the impact of chemicals on the aquatic environment.",,,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,Springer Nature,"0944-1344, 1614-7499",Animals; Crustacea; Ecosystem; Female; Fresh Water,2001-01,2001,,2001-01,8,1,49-55,Closed,Article,"Jungmann, Dirk; Brust, Kristin; Licht, Oliver; Mählmann, Jens; Schmidt, Jens; Nagel, Roland","Jungmann, Dirk (Institute of Hydrobiology, Ecotoxicology, Dresden University of Technology, Mommsenstrasse 13, D-01062, Dresden, Germany); Brust, Kristin (Institute of Hydrobiology, Ecotoxicology, Dresden University of Technology, Mommsenstrasse 13, D-01062, Dresden, Germany); Licht, Oliver (Institute of Hydrobiology, Ecotoxicology, Dresden University of Technology, Mommsenstrasse 13, D-01062, Dresden, Germany); Mählmann, Jens (Institute of Hydrobiology, Ecotoxicology, Dresden University of Technology, Mommsenstrasse 13, D-01062, Dresden, Germany); Schmidt, Jens (Institute of Hydrobiology, Ecotoxicology, Dresden University of Technology, Mommsenstrasse 13, D-01062, Dresden, Germany); Nagel, Roland (Institute of Hydrobiology, Ecotoxicology, Dresden University of Technology, Mommsenstrasse 13, D-01062, Dresden, Germany)","Jungmann, Dirk (TU Dresden)","Jungmann, Dirk (TU Dresden); Brust, Kristin (TU Dresden); Licht, Oliver (TU Dresden); Mählmann, Jens (TU Dresden); Schmidt, Jens (TU Dresden); Nagel, Roland (TU Dresden)",TU Dresden,grid.4488.0,Dresden,,Germany,,,,,,13,0,0.3,0.97,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1012250003,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,"A06 Agriculture, Veterinary and Food Science",

These pits are not only used as their home but seem to harbor a distinct assemblage of organisms. We investigated small-scale spatial variation in community of macroinvertebrates by comparing community composition of epilithic macroinvertebrates between those found on unmodified rocky substrate, inside pits occupied by rock-boring sea urchin Stomopneustes variolaris (Lamarck, 1816), and unoccupied pits, on an intertidal rocky shore in southern Thailand. Size structures of macroinvertebrates were compared between pits and analyses were performed to investigate whether the use of habitat depends on availability of space, or biological interactions between sea urchins and other macroinvertebrates. Size structure of the most abundant mobile fauna, top shells Trochus radiatus Gmelin, 1791, were also analyzed to assess whether they exhibit ontogenetic changes in habitat use. Although a few species were found in all habitat types, community compositions were different. Chitons and limpets were found exclusively on unmodified substrate; whereas relatively large-sized gastropods inhabited unoccupied pits, and occupied pits harbored small-sized crustacean and gastropod species. Generally, in occupied pits, small-sized faunas were more abundant than larger faunas, suggesting that sea urchin's body may function as a biogenic structure providing refugia for small-sized individuals. In unoccupied pits volume of all macroinvertebrates increased as available space increased. This was not observed in occupied pits, where disturbances due to sea urchin's activities may be more important in determining habitat use.","We thank Rueangrit Promdam and Sumaitt Putchakarn for their help in taxonomic identification.

While population-specific attributes are acknowledged to play a critical role in the success and impact of biological invasions in general, our knowledge of the causes and consequences of cryptic invasions is largely neglected. Cryptic invasions are inherently difficult to recognize and, despite being likely widespread, often go undetected. In this review, we analyse the sources, mechanisms, and consequences of cryptic invasions. Using a bibliometric survey, we first quantify the relative proportion of study questions, taxa, and geographic regions. We then highlight the value of comparative information from archived specimens in uncovering the occurrence and timing of cryptic invasions. We examine the mechanisms of cryptic invasions and emphasise the role of anthropogenic environmental changes on the arrival of cryptic invaders. We then discuss the role of interspecific biological interactions in the success of cryptic invasions and the role of hybridization between native and non-native lineages in cryptic invasions. We examine the competitive advantage of some invasive lineages in key physiological, ecological or sexually-selected traits. We argue that cryptic invasions, often undetected, may trigger subsequent rapid range expansions. We suggest that cryptic invasions are much more common than currently acknowledged. We highlight the role of coevolved associations (host-parasite, mutualism, herbivory), inherently population-specific, in the impacts of cryptic invasions on local communities.

Thus, prey capture is as important to predators as prey finding. We extend an existing framework for understanding the conjoint trajectories of predator and prey after encounters, by estimating the ratio of predator attack and prey danger perception distances, and apply it to wolf spiders attacking wood crickets. Disturbances to air flow upstream from running spiders, which are sensed by crickets, were assessed by computational fluid dynamics with the finite-elements method for a much simplified spider model: body size, speed and ground effect were all required to obtain a faithful representation of the aerodynamic signature of the spider, with the legs making only a minor contribution. The relationship between attack speed and the maximal distance at which the cricket can perceive the danger is parabolic; it splits the space defined by these two variables into regions differing in their values for this ratio. For this biological interaction, the ratio is no greater than one, implying immediate perception of the danger, from the onset of attack. Particular attention should be paid to the ecomechanical aspects of interactions with such small ratio, because of the high degree of bidirectional coupling of the behaviour of the two protagonists. This conclusion applies to several other predator-prey systems with sensory ecologies based on flow sensing, in air and water.","We thank A. Landres, O. Dangles, S. Pincebourde and S.

Epipactis veratrifolia (Orchidaceae) is a model system of aphid mimicry as aphidophagous hoverflies lay eggs on false brood sites on their flowers. To understand the evolutionary ecology of floral deception, we investigated the pollination biology of E. veratrifolia across 10 populations in the Eastern Himalayas. We reconstructed the phylogeny of Epipactis and mapped the known pollination systems of previously studied species onto the tree.ResultsSome inflorescences of E. veratrifolia were so infested with aphids while they were still in bud that the some larvae of hoverflies developed to the third instar while flower buds opened. This indicated that adult female hoverflies were partly rewarded for oviposition. Although flowers failed to secrete nectar, they mimicked both alarm pheromones and aphid coloring of to attract female hoverflies as their exclusive pollinators. Phylogenetic mapping indicate that pollination by aphidophagous hoverflies is likely an ancestral condition in the genus Epipactis. We suggest that the biological interaction of aphid (prey), orchid (primary producer) and hoverfly (predator) may represent an intermediate stage between mutualism and deception in the evolution of pollination-by-deceit in E. veratrifolia.ConclusionsOur analyses indicate that this intermediate stage may be used as a model system to interpret the origin of oviposition (brood site) mimicry in Epipactis. We propose the hypothesis that some deceptive pollination systems evolved directly from earlier (partly) mutualistic systems that maintained the fidelity of the original pollinator(s) even though rewards (nectar/ brood site) were lost.","We thank Profs.

Assessment of gene flow within and among sympatric long‐eared bat species,"Species are the basic units for measuring biodiversity and for comprehending biological interactions. Yet, their delineation is often contentious, especially in groups that are both diverse and phenotypically conservative. Three cryptic species of long-eared bats, Plecotus auritus, P. austriacus, and P. macrobullaris, co-occur over extensive areas of Western Europe. The latter is a fairly recent discovery, questioning the overall diversity of the entire Plecotus complex. Yet, high morphological and acoustic similarities compromise the reliable identification of long-eared bats in the field. We postulate that such extensive phenotypic overlap, along with the recurrent observation of morphologically intermediate individuals, may hide rampant interspecific hybridization. Based on a geographic sampling centered on areas of sympatry in the Alps and Corsica, we assessed the level of reproductive isolation of these three Plecotus species with mitochondrial and nuclear markers, looking at both inter- and intraspecific genetic population structuring. No sign of hybridization was detected between these three species that appear well separated biologically. Genetic structuring of populations, however, reflected different species-specific responses to environmental connectivity, that is, to the presence of orographic or sea barriers. While the Alpine range and the Ligurian Sea coincided with sharp genetic discontinuities in P. macrobullaris and P. austriacus, the more ubiquitous P. auritus showed no significant population structuration. There were clear phylogeographic discrepancies between microsatellite and mitochondrial markers at the intraspecific level, however, which challenges the reliance on simple barcoding approaches for the delineation of sound conservation units.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We warmly thank Orly Razgour who provided essential information on microsatellites genotyping, and Andrea Galimberti, David Progin and Roberto Toffoli who shared critical tissue samples.

Here, I describe a femur and partial tibia shaft assignable to theropods from two Late Cretaceous sites in New Jersey. The former, identifiable as the femur of a large ornithomimosaur, bears several scores interpreted as shark feeding traces. The tibia shaft has punctures and flaked bone from the bites of mid-sized crocodyliforms, the first documented occurrence of crocodyliform traces on dinosaur bone from the Maastrichtian of the Atlantic Coastal Plain. The surface of the partial tibia is also littered with indentations interpreted as the traces of invertebrates, revealing a microcosm of biological interaction on the coastal seafloor of the Cretaceous Atlantic Ocean. Massive crocodyliforms, such as Deinosuchus rugosus and the slightly smaller Deltasuchus motherali, maintained the role of terrestrial vertebrate taphonomic process drivers in eastern North America during the Cretaceous. The report of crocodyliform bite marks on the ornithomimosaur tibia shaft in this manuscript reinforces the importance of the role of crocodyliforms in the modification of terrestrial vertebrate remains during the Cretaceous in North America. The preserved invertebrate traces add to the sparse record of the presence of barnacles and other marine invertebrates on dinosaur bone, and the evidence of shark feeding on the ornithomimosaur femur support the ""bloat-and-float"" model of terrestrial vertebrate fossil deposition in marine deposits from the Cretaceous of eastern North America.",The authors received no funding for this work.

The absence of a species from areas of otherwise suitable habitat might indicate localized species-specific influences, including biological interactions with competitors, consumers or pathogens, on local population persistence. I used Bray-Curtis ordination axis scores, based on the distributions of forest birds across census plots in eastern North America, as proxies of general features of habitat suitability to predict local abundances of each species of small land bird. I then applied spatial analysis to identify significant spatial structure (Moran's I) in residuals (positive or negative) from predicted local densities, which would indicate localized species-specific influences on population size. Fifty-eight of 79 species exhibited no significant spatial structure in residual abundances, indicating that the ordination axes reflect most of the spatial variation in environmental conditions and habitat characteristics that influence population distribution and density or that samples were too small to detect significant spatial variation. Twenty-one species exhibited significant habitat-independent spatial structure of residuals within distances of 100 km. Aggregations of residuals for these species were independently located, for the most part, and thus probably unrelated to general features of the environment that affect many species. Among factors considered as potential causes of spatial anomalies, positive density dependence (Allee effects), intraspecific social aggregation and area sensitivity in response to forest fragmentation find little support in this analysis. Because of the species-specific nature of these clustered residuals, specialized pathogens are potential candidates to drive spatial anomalies in host abundance.","Jim Lowe, Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, graciously provided the Breeding Bird Census data.

2206,pub.1112505115,10.1007/s00442-019-04359-3,30826868,,,The mechanisms by which oysters facilitate invertebrates vary across environmental gradients,"The effective use of ecosystem engineers to conserve biodiversity requires an understanding of the types of resources an engineer modifies, and how these modifications vary with biotic and abiotic context. In the intertidal zone, oysters engineer ecological communities by reducing temperature and desiccation stress, enhancing the availability of hard substrate for attachment, and by ameliorating biological interactions such as competition and predation. Using a field experiment manipulating shading, predator access and availability of shell substrate at four sites distributed over 900 km of east Australian coastline, we investigated how the relative importance of these mechanisms of facilitation vary spatially. At all sites, and irrespective of environmental conditions, the provision of hard substrate by oysters enhanced the abundance and richness of invertebrates, in particular epibionts (barnacles and oyster spat) and grazing gastropods. Mobile arthropods utilised the habitat provided by disarticulated dead oysters more than live oyster habitat, whereas the abundance of polychaetes and bivalves were much greater in live oysters, suggesting the oyster filter-feeding activity is important for these groups. In warmer estuaries, shading by oysters had a larger effect on biodiversity, whereas in cooler estuaries, the provision of a predation refuge by oysters played a more important role. Such knowledge of how ecosystem engineering effects vary across environmental gradients can help inform management strategies targeting ecosystem resilience via the amelioration of specific environmental stressors, or conservation of specific community assemblages.","We thank A.

2206,pub.1039233654,10.1002/ecy.1546,27870024,,,Macroinvertebrate community assembly on deep‐sea wood falls in Monterey Bay is strongly influenced by wood type,"Environmental filtering, including the influence of environmental constraints and biological interactions on species' survival, is known to significantly affect patterns of community assembly in terrestrial ecosystems. However, its role in regulating patterns and processes of community assembly in deep-sea environments is poorly studied. Here we investigated the role of wood characteristics in the assembly of deep-sea wood fall communities. Ten different wood species (substrata) that varied in structural complexity were sunk to a depth of 3,100 m near Monterey Bay, CA. In total, 28 wood parcels were deployed on the deep-sea bed. After 2 yr, the wood parcels were recovered with over 7,000 attached or colonizing macroinvertebrates. All macroinvertebrates were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible, and included several undescribed species. Diversity indices and multivariate analyses of variance detected significant variation in the colonizing community assemblages among different wood substrata. Structural complexity seemed to be the primary factor altering community composition between wood substrata. For example, wood-boring clams were most abundant on solid logs, while small arthropods and limpets were more abundant on bundles of branches that provided more surface area and small, protected spaces to occupy. Other factors such as chemical defenses, the presence of bark, and wood hardness likely also played a role. Our finding that characteristics of woody debris entering the marine realm can have significant effects on community assembly supports the notion of ecological and perhaps evolutionarily significant links between land and sea.","We would like to thank employees of the Tilden Park Regional Parks Botanical Garden, the City of Berkeley, UC Berkeley, and local tree service businesses and community members that donated wood and tree cuttings for this project.

They are often used to quantify the degree of specialization between partners, but usually based on qualitative indices such as 'connectance' or number of links. These measures ignore interaction frequencies or sampling intensity, and strongly depend on network size.ResultsHere we introduce two quantitative indices using interaction frequencies to describe the degree of specialization, based on information theory. The first measure (d') describes the degree of interaction specialization at the species level, while the second measure (H2') characterizes the degree of specialization or partitioning among two parties in the entire network. Both indices are mathematically related and derived from Shannon entropy. The species-level index d' can be used to analyze variation within networks, while H2' as a network-level index is useful for comparisons across different interaction webs. Analyses of two published pollinator networks identified differences and features that have not been detected with previous approaches. For instance, plants and pollinators within a network differed in their average degree of specialization (weighted mean d'), and the correlation between specialization of pollinators and their relative abundance also differed between the webs. Rarefied sampling effort in both networks and null model simulations suggest that H2' is not affected by network size or sampling intensity.ConclusionQuantitative analyses reflect properties of interaction networks more appropriately than previous qualitative attempts, and are robust against variation in sampling intensity, network size and symmetry. These measures will improve our understanding of patterns of specialization within and across networks from a broad spectrum of biological interactions.","We thank Diego Vázquez, Pedro Jordano, Thomas Hovestadt, and Michel Loreau for helpful comments and valuable discussion on earlier versions of this manuscript and the Interaction Web Database [53] for providing the datasets used here.",,BMC Ecology and Evolution,,Springer Nature,"2730-7182, 1472-6785","Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Argentina; Bees; Computer Simulation; Ecosystem; Food Chain; Models, Biological; Plant Physiological Phenomena; Pollen; Population Dynamics; Species Specificity; United Kingdom",2006-08-14,2006,2006-08-14,2006,6,1,9,All OA; Gold,Article,"Blüthgen, Nico; Menzel, Florian; Blüthgen, Nils","Blüthgen, Nico (Department of Animal Ecology and Tropical Biology, University of Würzburg, Biozentrum, Am Hubland, 97074, Würzburg, Germany); Menzel, Florian (Department of Animal Ecology and Tropical Biology, University of Würzburg, Biozentrum, Am Hubland, 97074, Würzburg, Germany); Blüthgen, Nils (Institute of Theoretical Biology, Berlin and Institute of Molecular Neurobiology, Humboldt University, Free University of Berlin, 10115-14195, Berlin, Germany)","Blüthgen, Nico (University of Würzburg)","Blüthgen, Nico (University of Würzburg); Menzel, Florian (University of Würzburg); Blüthgen, Nils ()",University of Würzburg,grid.8379.5,Wurzburg,Bayern,Germany,,,,,,995,346,10.33,75.63,,https://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1472-6785-6-9,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1017472876,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,B11 Computer Science and Informatics,

Estimates of effective population size (Ne) can therefore be informative about population persistence, but there is a need for an assessment of their consistency and informative relevance. Here we review the body of empirical estimates of Ne for wild populations obtained with the temporal genetic method and published since Frankham's (1995) review. Theoretical considerations have identified important sources of bias for this analytical approach, and we use empirical data to investigate the extent of these biases. We find that particularly model selection and sampling require more attention in future studies. We report a median unbiased Ne estimate of 260 (among 83 studies) and find that this median estimate tends to be smaller for populations of conservation concern, which may therefore be more sensitive to genetic stochasticity. Furthermore, we report a median Ne/N ratio of 0.14, and find that this ratio may actually be higher for small populations, suggesting changes in biological interactions at low population abundances. We confirm the role of gene flow in countering genetic stochasticity by finding that Ne correlates strongest with neutral genetic metrics when populations can be considered isolated. This underlines the importance of gene flow for the estimation of Ne, and of population connectivity for conservation in general. Reductions in contemporary gene flow due to ongoing habitat fragmentation will likely increase the prevalence of genetic stochasticity, which should therefore remain a focal point in the conservation of biodiversity.","We thank Dylan Fraser, Laura Weir, Jeff Hutchings, Paul Bentzen and Joe Bielawski for valuable feedback and stimulating discussions on earlier drafts.

In this context we address the following questions: 1) How the expected changes in abiotic factors (temperature, and water) differentially affect the ecophysiological performance of the plant Colobanthus quitensis? and 2) Will this environmental change indirectly affect C. quitensis photochemical performance and biomass accumulation by modifying its association with fungal endophytes? Plants of C. quitensis from King George Island in the South Shetland archipelago (62°09' S), and Lagotellerie Island in the Antarctic Peninsula (65°53' S) were put under simulated abiotic conditions in growth chambers following predictive models of global climate change (GCC). The indirect effect of GCC on the interaction between C. quitensis and fungal endophytes was assessed in a field experiment carried out in the Antarctica, in which we eliminated endophytes under contemporary conditions and applied experimental watering to simulate increased precipitation input. We measured four proxies of plant performance. First, we found that warming (+W) significantly increased plant performance, however its effect tended to be less than watering (+W) and combined warming and watering (+T°+W). Second, the presence of fungal endophytes improved plant performance, and its effect was significantly decreased under experimental watering. Our results indicate that both biotic and abiotic factors affect ecophysiological performance, and the directions of these influences will change with climate change. Our findings provide valuable information that will help to predict future population spread and evolution through using ecological niche models under different climatic scenarios.","This work was supported by the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH Projects: T-14-08 and RT-11-13).

Our aim was to answer questions related to the effect of inter- vs. intra-specific interactions on the growth and utilization of undisturbed space by fine roots within three dimensions (3D) using micro X-ray computed tomography. To achieve this, Populus tremuloides (quaking aspen) and Picea mariana (black spruce) seedlings were planted into containers as either solitary individuals, or inter-/intra-specific pairs, allowed to grow for 2 months, and 3D metrics developed in order to quantify their use of belowground space. In both aspen and spruce, inter-specific root interactions produced a shift in the vertical distribution of the root system volume, and deepened the average position of root tips when compared to intra-specifically growing seedlings. Inter-specific interactions also increased the minimum distance between root tips belonging to the same root system. There was no effect of belowground interactions on the radial distribution of roots, or the directionality of lateral root growth for either species. In conclusion, we found that significant differences were observed more often when comparing controls (solitary individuals) and paired seedlings (inter- or intra-specific), than when comparing inter- and intra-specifically growing seedlings. This would indicate that competition between neighboring seedlings was more responsible for shifting fine root growth in both species than was neighbor identity. However, significant inter- vs. intra-specific differences were observed, which further emphasizes the importance of biological interactions in competition studies.","We acknowledge the invaluable assistance provided by Cornell&#x27;s nano- and micro-CT facility run by Mark Riccio.

In cases where such shifts lead to the colonization of a new ecosystem, it is critical to establish how the shifting species itself is impacted by novel environmental and biological interactions. Anthropogenic habitats that are analogous to the historic habitat of a shifting species may play a crucial role in the ability of that species to expand or persist in suboptimal colonized ecosystems. We tested if the anthropogenic habitat of docks, a likely mangrove analog, provides improved conditions for the range-shifting mangrove tree crab Aratus pisonii within the colonized suboptimal salt marsh ecosystem. To test if docks provided an improved habitat, we compared the impact of the salt marsh and dock habitats on ecological and life history traits that influence the ability of this species to persist and expand into the salt marsh and compared these back to baselines in the historic mangrove ecosystem. Specifically, we examined behavior, physiology, foraging, and the thermal conditions of A. pisonii in each habitat. We found that docks provide a more favorable thermal and foraging habitat than the surrounding salt marsh, while their ability to provide conditions which improved behavior and physiology was mixed. Our study shows that anthropogenic habitats can act as analogs to historic ecosystems and enhance the habitat quality for range-shifting species in colonized suboptimal ecosystems. If the patterns that we document are general across systems, then anthropogenic habitats may play an important facilitative role in the range shifts of species with continued climate change.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors thank K.

Here, we examine how endolithic parasitism of an invasive and an indigenous mussel species acts in synergy with abiotic conditions of the habitat. Our results show that the invasive Mytilus galloprovincialis is more infested than the native Perna perna and this difference is probably due to the greater thickness of the protective outer-layer of the shell of the indigenous species. Higher abrasion due to waves on the open coast could account for dissimilarities in degree of infestation between bays and the more wave-exposed open coast. Also micro-scale variations of light affected the level of endolithic parasitism, which was more intense at non-shaded sites. The higher levels of endolithic parasitism in Mytilus mirrored greater mortality rates attributed to parasitism in this species. Condition index, attachment strength and shell strength of both species were negatively affected by the parasites suggesting an energy trade-off between the need to repair the damaged shell and the other physiological parameters. We suggest that, because it has a lower attachment strength and a thinner shell, the invasiveness of M. galloprovincialis will be limited at sun and wave exposed locations where endolithic activity, shell scouring and risk of dislodgement are high. These results underline the crucial role of physical environment in regulating biotic stress, and how these physical-biological interactions may explain site-to-site variability of competitive balances between invasive and indigenous species.",We thank Liesl Knott for technical support.,"Funding: This work is based upon research supported by the South African Research Chairs Initiative of the Department of Science and Technology and National Research Foundation with additional funding from Rhodes University and a Claude Harris Leon postdoctoral research fellowship Foundation awarded to GIZ.

Although many trace element-containing proteins are well characterized, little is known about the general trends in trace element utilization. We carried out comparative genomic analyses of copper, molybdenum, nickel, cobalt (in the form of vitamin B(12)), and selenium (in the form of selenocysteine) in 747 sequenced organisms at the following levels: (i) transporters and transport-related proteins, (ii) cofactor biosynthesis traits, and (iii) trace element-dependent proteins. Few organisms were found to utilize all five trace elements, whereas many symbionts, parasites, and yeasts used only one or none of these elements. Investigation of metalloproteomes and selenoproteomes revealed examples of increased utilization of proteins that use copper in land plants, cobalt in Dehalococcoides and Dictyostelium, and selenium in fish and algae, whereas nematodes were found to have great diversity of copper transporters. These analyses also characterized trace element metabolism in common model organisms and suggested new model organisms for experimental studies of individual trace elements. Mismatches in the occurrence of user proteins and corresponding transport systems revealed deficiencies in our understanding of trace element biology. Biological interactions among some trace elements were observed; however, such links were limited, and trace elements generally had unique utilization patterns. Finally, environmental factors, such as oxygen requirement and habitat, correlated with the utilization of certain trace elements. These data provide insights into the general features of utilization and evolution of trace elements in the three domains of life.",National Institutes of Health (GM061603),,Journal of Biological Chemistry,,Elsevier,"0021-9258, 1083-351X","Amino Acid Sequence; Archaea; Cobalt; Copper; Dictyostelium; Genomics; Molecular Sequence Data; Molybdenum; Nickel; Oxygen; Phylogeny; Proteomics; Selenium; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Trace Elements",2009-11-02,2009,2009-11-02,2010-01,285,5,3393-3405,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Zhang, Yan; Gladyshev, Vadim N.","Zhang, Yan (From the Division of Genetics, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115); Gladyshev, Vadim N.

Here, the term “purification” is defined, in a wide sense, as the potential role of a water body to contribute to the reduction of pollutants and thus controlling eutrophication. Also regarded as a kind of ecological regulating services, biological purification involves various processes concerning seasonal nutrient fixation, such as uptake by aquatic macrophyte, biofouling onto foliage substrates, feeding by organisms in higher trophic level, and eternal loss or removal of substance from the water. In order to evaluate the water purification ability, a numerical lake ecosystem model (EcoTaihu) was developed and applied to Lakes Taihu. The model includes the biological interactions between pelagic compartments (phytoplankton and zooplankton, detritus, dissolved organic matter, fish, and nutrients). Under dynamic forcing of meteorological and hydrological parameters, the model was run over years to evaluate the annual nutrient cycles and purification functions. The reproducibility of the model was validated for water body by comparison with the field data from the water quality monitoring campaign. Numerical results revealed that self-purification capacity of nitrogen of Lake Taihu in years 2006, 2008, and 2010 is 4.00 × 104, 4.27 × 104, and 4.11 × 104 ton, respectively, whereas self-purification capacity of phosphorus of Lake Taihu in years 2006, 2008, and 2010 is 1.56 × 103, 1.80 × 103, and 1.71 × 103 ton, respectively.","This work was jointly supported by the research project “Study on the influence of water level control on submerged vegetation in a lake and the mechanism” (NSFC41230853), State Major Project of Water Pollution Control and Management (Grant No. 2014ZX07101-011), and “Accurate evaluation technology of cyanobacteria bloom stock in the lake”(NIGLAS2012135010).

2204,pub.1007205628,10.1371/journal.pone.0165743,27788257,PMC5082818,,Oviposition Substrate of the Mountain Fly Drosophila nigrosparsa (Diptera: Drosophilidae),"The survival of insect larvae often depends on the mother's choice of oviposition substrate, and thus, this choice is an essential part of an insect species' ecology. Especially species with narrow substrate preferences may suffer from changes in substrate availability triggered by, for example, climate change. Recent climate warming is affecting species directly (e.g., physiology) but also indirectly (e.g., biological interactions) leading to mismatching phenologies and distributions. However, the preferred oviposition substrate is still unknown for many drosophilid species, especially for those at higher elevations. In this study, we investigated the oviposition-substrate preference of the montane-alpine fly Drosophila nigrosparsa in rearing and multiple-choice experiments using natural substrates in the laboratory. Insect emergence from field-collected substrates was tested. More than 650 insects were reared from natural substrates, among them 152 drosophilids but no individual of D. nigrosparsa. In the multiple-choice experiments, D. nigrosparsa preferred ovipositing on mushrooms (> 93% of eggs); additionally, a few eggs were laid on berries but none on other substrates such as cow faeces, rotten plant material, and soil. The flies laid 24 times more eggs per day when mushrooms were included in the substrates than when they were excluded. We infer that D. nigrosparsa is a mushroom breeder with some variation in oviposition choice. The flies favoured some mushrooms over others, but they were not specialised on a single fungal taxon. Although it is unclear if and how climate change will affect D. nigrosparsa, our results indicate that this species will not be threatened by oviposition-substrate limitations in the near future because of the broad altitudinal distribution of the mushrooms considered here, even if the flies will have to shift upwards to withstand increasing temperatures.","This research was supported by the University of Innsbruck and the Austrian Science Fund (FWF, http://www.fwf.ac.at/) under grant P23949 awarded to FMS.

2204,pub.1001589208,10.1111/jpy.12259,26986263,,,An association network analysis among microeukaryotes and bacterioplankton reveals algal bloom dynamics,"Algal blooms are a worldwide phenomenon and the biological interactions that underlie their regulation are only just beginning to be understood. It is established that algal microorganisms associate with many other ubiquitous, oceanic organisms, but the interactions that lead to the dynamics of bloom formation are currently unknown. To address this gap, we used network approaches to investigate the association patterns among microeukaryotes and bacterioplankton in response to a natural Scrippsiella trochoidea bloom. This is the first study to apply network approaches to bloom dynamics. To this end, terminal restriction fragment (T-RF) length polymorphism analysis showed dramatic changes in community compositions of microeukaryotes and bacterioplankton over the blooming period. A variance ratio test revealed significant positive overall associations both within and between microeukaryotic and bacterioplankton communities. An association network generated from significant correlations between T-RFs revealed that S. trochoidea had few connections to other microeukaryotes and bacterioplankton and was placed on the edge. This lack of connectivity allowed for the S. trochoidea sub-network to break off from the overall network. These results allowed us to propose a conceptual model for explaining how changes in microbial associations regulate the dynamics of an algal bloom. In addition, key T-RFs were screened by principal components analysis, correlation coefficients, and network analysis.

In addition, we reported the peculiar parasitic association between two hydrozoan species: the polypoid phase (stolon and medusoid buds) of C. octonaria (parasite) and the free-swimming medusa of Liriope tetraphylla (Limnomedusae) (host) over a one-year sampling period (February 2014 to March 2015) in the coasts of Mar del Plata, Argentina. We examined the seasonality, prevalence, and intensity of parasitic infection. Metadata associated with the medusa collection was also used to map areas of seasonality where such association was observed. Cunina octonaria was found from southern Uruguay to the coast of Mar del Plata (34.8-38.2°S, 57.2-54.0°W), with the highest abundances and frequency of occurrence in the Río de la Plata estuary. The parasitic association was identified from the austral warm period (spring-summer season) until mid-autumn. Out of the 21,734 L. tetraphylla specimens that were examined, 316 were parasitized (prevalence = 1.5%) exclusively in the manubrium and gastric peduncle, with an infection intensity of 1 to 2 stolons per host. Furthermore, the medusoid buds per stolon ranged from 11 and 29 at different stages of development. No significant differences were observed between the umbrella diameter of parasitized and non-parasitized L. tetraphylla specimens, nor was any significant correlation identified between umbrella diameter and prevalence, and intensity of infection. According to the aggregation coefficient, C. octonaria had an overdispersed distribution in the host population. All parasitized hosts showed stomach vacuity due to the location of the stolon, which blocked the mouth of the host. We identified the parasitic association in the coasts of Mar del Plata, as well as in both coasts of the Río de la Plata Estuary (Uruguayan-Argentinean coasts). In the Southwestern Atlantic, several biological interactions between medusae and other groups have been identified; however, the specific host selectivity of C. octonaria for L. tetraphylla was not previously identified. Here we discuss the ecological importance of this association during the holoplanktonic life history of the narcomedusae. Additionally, we report the southern limit of the spatial distribution of this particular parasitic association in the Southwestern Atlantic, thus increasing the knowledge of biological associations of gelatinous zooplankton (Cnidaria and Ctenophora) on Uruguayan and Argentinean coasts.",,,Zoological Studies,,,"1021-5506, 1810-522X",,2020-11-19,2020,2020-11-19,,59,,e57,All OA; Gold,Article,"Puente-Tapia, Francisco Alejandro; Castiglioni, Florencia; Failla Siquier, Gabriela; Genzano, Gabriel","Puente-Tapia, Francisco Alejandro (Instituto de Investigaciones Marinas y Costeras (IIMyC), Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata (FCEyN, UNMdP), Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), Mar del Plata, Argentina.

This question becomes particularly relevant for microorganisms thriving in the highly diluted waters of high mountain lakes, where biotic interactions might be required to make the most of an extreme environment. We studied a high-throughput gene data set of alpine lakes (>220 Pyrenean lakes) with cooccurrence network analysis to infer potential biotic interactions, using the combination of a probabilistic method for determining significant cooccurrences and coexclusions between pairs of species and a conceptual framework for classifying the nature of the observed cooccurrences and coexclusions. This computational approach (i) determined and quantified the importance of environmental variables and spatial distribution and (ii) defined potential interacting microbial assemblages. We determined the properties and relationships between these assemblages by examining node properties at the taxonomic level, indicating associations with their potential habitat sources (i.e., aquatic versus terrestrial) and their functional strategies (i.e., parasitic versus mixotrophic). Environmental variables explained fewer pairs in bacteria than in microbial eukaryotes for the alpine data set, with pH alone explaining the highest proportion of bacterial pairs. Nutrient composition was also relevant for explaining association pairs, particularly in microeukaryotes. We identified a reduced subset of pairs with the highest probability of species interactions (""interacting guilds"") that significantly reached higher occupancies and lower mean relative abundances in agreement with the carrying capacity hypothesis. The interacting bacterial guilds could be more related to habitat and microdispersal processes (i.e., aquatic versus soil microbes), whereas for microeukaryotes trophic roles (osmotrophs, mixotrophs, and parasitics) could potentially play a major role. Overall, our approach may add helpful information to guide further efforts for a mechanistic understanding of microbial interactions in situ. IMPORTANCE A fundamental question in biology is why some species tend to occur together in the same locations, while others are never observed to coexist. This question becomes particularly relevant for microorganisms thriving in the highly diluted waters of high mountain lakes, in which biotic interactions might be required to make the most of an extreme environment. Microbial metacommunities are too often only studied in terms of their environmental niches and geographic barriers since they show inherent difficulties to quantify biological interactions and their role as drivers of ecosystem functioning. Our study highlights that telling apart potential interactions from both environmental and geographic niches may help for the initial characterization of organisms with similar ecologies in a large scope of ecosystems, even when information about actual interactions is partial and limited. The multilayered statistical approach carried out here offers the possibility of going beyond taxonomy to understand microbiological behavior in situ.","We thank the technicians and students who participated in the field sampling expeditions, L.

Despite the importance of parasitism as an agent of plankton mortality, parasite-host dynamics remain poorly understood, especially over time, hindering the inclusion of parasitism in food web and ecosystem models. For a full year in the Skidaway River Estuary (Georgia), we employed weekly 18S rRNA sampling and co-occurrence network analysis to characterize temporal parasite-host infection dynamics of Syndiniales. Over the year, Syndiniales exhibited strong temporal variability, with higher relative abundance from June to October (7 to 28%) than other months in the year (0.01% to 6%). Nonmetric dimensional scaling of Syndiniales composition revealed tight clustering in June to October that coincided with elevated temperatures (23 to 31°C), though in general, abiotic factors poorly explained composition (canonical correspondence analysis [CCA] and partial least-squares [PLS]) and were less important in the network than biotic relationships. Syndiniales amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were well represented in the co-occurrence network (20% of edges) and had significant positive associations (Spearman r > 0.7), inferred to be putative parasite-host relationships, with known dinoflagellate hosts (e.g., Akashiwo and Gymnodinium) and other protist groups (e.g., ciliates, radiolarians, and diatoms). Positive associations rarely involved a single Syndiniales and dinoflagellate species, implying flexible parasite-host infection dynamics. These findings provide insight into the temporal dynamics of Syndiniales over a full year and reinforce the importance of single-celled parasites in driving plankton population dynamics. Further empirical work is needed to confirm network interactions and to incorporate parasitism within the context of ecosystem models.IMPORTANCE Protist parasites in the marine alveolate group, Syndiniales, have been observed within infected plankton host cells for decades, and recently, global-scale efforts (Tara Ocean exploration) have confirmed their importance within microbial communities. Yet, protist parasites remain enigmatic, particularly with respect to their temporal dynamics and parasite-host interactions. We employed weekly 18S amplicon surveys over a full year in a coastal estuary, revealing strong temporal shifts in Syndiniales parasites, with highest relative abundance during warmer summer to fall months. Though influenced by temperature, Syndiniales population dynamics were also driven by a high frequency of biological interactions with other protist groups, as determined through co-occurrence network analysis. Parasitic interactions implied by the network highlighted a range of confirmed (dinoflagellates) and putative (diatoms) interactions and suggests parasites may be less selective in their preferred hosts. Understanding parasite-host dynamics over space and time will improve our ability to include parasitism as a loss term in microbial food web models.",We thank the staff at the Georgia Genomics and Bioinformatics Core at the University of Georgia for their advisement and assistance with sequencing preparation.

2096,pub.1058707892,10.1086/416841,2236483,,,The ecology and evolution of inducible defenses.,"Inducible defenses are responses activated through a previous encounter with a consumer or competitor that confer some degree of resistance to subsequent attacks. While the importance of inducible resistance has long been known in host-parasite interactions, it is only recently that its importance has emerged in other natural systems. Although the structural defenses produced by invertebrates to their competitors and predators are by no means the same as an immune response triggered by parasites, these responses all share the properties of (1) specificity, (2) amplification and (3) memory. This review discusses the following ecological consequences and evolutionary causes of inducible defenses: (1) Inducible defenses render historical factors important in biological interactions and can affect the probability of individual survival and growth, as well as affect population dynamics of consumers in some circumstances. (2) Although the benefits of inducible defenses are often balanced by fitness costs, including reduced growth, reproductive output and survivorship, the role of costs and benefits in the evolution of inducible defenses is by no means clear. A more integrated approach would involve a multivariate analysis of the role of natural selection on the inducible characters of interest, their norms of reaction and correlated fitness characters. (3) The disproportionate representation of inducible, morphological defenses among clonal organisms may be due to both a higher rate of origination and enhanced selection to maintain these defenses in clonal taxa. (4) Inducible defenses should be most common when reliable cues are available, attacks by biological agents are unpredictable, and the fitness gains of defenses are balanced by the costs. An integrated approach to studying inducible defenses would thus combine mechanistic estimates of costs, population-level estimates of defense effectiveness, and genetic estimates of correlations between fitness and inducible characters. This will allow us to estimate rates of evolution in these phenotypically plastic threshold characters.",,,The Quarterly Review of Biology,,University of Chicago Press,"0033-5770, 1539-7718",Animals; Biological Evolution; Competitive Behavior; Ecology; Game Theory; Memory; Phenotype; Predatory Behavior,1990-09,1990,,1990-09,65,3,323-40,Closed,Article,"Harvell, C D","Harvell, C D (Section of Ecology and Systematics, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853.)",,"Harvell, C D (Cornell University)",Cornell University,grid.5386.8,Ithaca,New York,United States,,,,,,492,33,6.23,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1058707892,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3104 Evolutionary Biology,,,,,,A05 Biological Sciences,

Most research attention and understanding about the impacts of hypoxia on estuarine species has focused on the benthos, where hypoxia is most common. Although the pelagic zone is also susceptible to the effects of hypoxia, the biological interactions and consequences are not as well understood in marine environments because documenting exposure or avoidance of hypoxia is often difficult. Physiological biomarkers may provide a way to gain more detailed spatiotemporal information regarding species' exposure to hypoxia. Here, we identified and tested a hypoxia-specific responsive gene, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (hif-1α), to evaluate its potential as a biomarker for hypoxia exposure in Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii). We conducted controlled laboratory experiments to establish the level of hepatic hif-1α elevated gene expression (>1 sd normoxic mean), exposure amplification (≥2 hours), reduction rate (ca. 24 hours), and some evidence of a lethal hypoxic limit (ca. 2 mg L(-1), ≥4 hours). We then used these findings to evaluate the spatiotemporal patterns of hif-1α for Pacific herring in a seasonally hypoxia estuary, Hood Canal, Washington, USA. Although expression did not parallel the local hypoxic conditions in the estuary, herring from the more severe hypoxic year (2013) had a higher probability of having elevated mRNA levels. These patterns indicate that hepatic hif-1α levels may not be directly indicative of local DO levels for pelagic marine fish, but rather provide insight into hypoxia exposure over broader scales.","Thanks to Sam White for his guidance and answering of copious amounts of genetic-related questions.

This research aimed at expanding the knowledge of the role played by AMF in the uptake of macro- and micronutrients and N transfer (using a 15N stem-labelling method) in a faba bean/wheat intercropping system. It also investigates the role of AMF in biological N fixation (using the natural isotopic abundance method) in faba bean grown in pure stand and in mixture. Finally, it examines the role of AMF in driving competition and facilitation between faba bean and wheat. Durum wheat and faba bean were grown in pots (five pots per treatment) as sole crops or in mixture in the presence or absence of AMF. Root colonisation by AMF was greater in faba bean than in wheat and increased when species were mixed compared to pure stand (particularly for faba bean). Mycorrhizal symbiosis positively influenced root biomass, specific root length, and root density and increased the uptake of P, Fe, and Zn in wheat (both in pure stand and in mixture) but not in faba bean. Furthermore, AMF symbiosis increased the percentage of N derived from the atmosphere in the total N biomass of faba bean grown in mixture (+20%) but not in pure stand. Nitrogen transfer from faba bean to wheat was low (2.5-3.0 mg pot-1); inoculation with AMF increased N transfer by 20%. Overall, in terms of above- and belowground growth and uptake of nutrients, mycorrhization favoured the stronger competitor in the mixture (wheat) without negatively affecting the companion species (faba bean). Results of this study confirm the role of AMF in driving biological interactions among neighbouring plants.","The present research was funded by the project &quot;Sviluppo tecnologico e innovazione per la sostenibilità e competitività della cerealicoltura meridionale &quot; by the Italian Ministry for Education, University, and Research (MIUR) (PON/01_01145 – ISCOCEM, Fondazione Angelo e Salvatore Lima Mancuso - Università degli Studi di Palermo).

The in situ tracer experiments were carried out along a depth transect on the Indian margin over a period of 4 to 10 days.

The decrease of total carbon uptake from 540 to 1100 m suggests a higher demand for carbon by species in the low-oxygen core region of the OMZ or less food competition with macrofauna. Especially Uvigerinids showed high uptake of phytodetrital carbon at the lowest oxygenated site. Variation in the ratio of phytodetrital carbon to nitrogen between species and sites indicates that foraminiferal carbon and nitrogen use can be decoupled and different nutritional demands are found between species. Lower ratio of phytodetrital carbon and nitrogen at 540 m could hint for greater demand or storage of food-based nitrogen, ingestion, or hosting of bacteria under almost anoxic conditions. Shifts in the foraminiferal assemblage structure (controlled by oxygen or food availability) and in the presence of other benthic organisms are likely to account for observed changes in the processing of phytodetritus in the different OMZ habitats. Foraminifera dominate the short-term processing of phytodetritus in the OMZ core but are less important in the lower OMZ boundary region of the Indian margin as biological interactions and species distribution of foraminifera change with depth and oxygen levels.",We are very grateful to Hiroshi Kitazato for the possibility to participate in the research cruise “YK08-11.” We thank the captain and crew of the R/V Yokohama and the pilots of the submersible Shinkai 6500 for the skillful performed dives.

Male attractiveness may depend on traits beneficial to the reproductive success (RS) of any female, termed 'universal quality', and/or on behavioral and biological interactions between potential mates that reflect 'compatibility'. The steroid hormone testosterone (T) often underlies male attractiveness in rodents and is associated with enhanced paternal care in the monogamous and biparental California mouse (Peromyscus californicus). We hypothesized that (1) T-characteristics are universally attractive to female California mice and that (2) if reproductive success is higher for females mated with preferred males, then females mated with males preferred by other females will also have higher reproductive success. Alternatively, we speculated that pair compatibility, based on emergent pair qualities, is important for a species with coordinated offspring care. We assessed individual T-characteristics in three ways: (1) T-response to GnRH challenges (2) baseline T-level and (3) T-response to a female. Testosterone-response did not predict female preference, but females spent more time investigating males with higher baseline T (accounting for only 9.6% of the variation in investigation time). None of the T-measures was associated with RS. Females paired with males they preferred produced litters more quickly and had higher RS than females paired with their non-preferred males. Naïve females who did not undergo preference tests had equivalent RS regardless of whether their mate was preferred or non-preferred by another female. These data suggest that higher male T elicits investigation, but female preference in the California mouse is more strongly linked with compatibility because individual preference was a better predictor of RS than any T measure.","We thank E.

Fish early life stages have narrow thermal windows and are thus more vulnerable to further changes in water temperature. The aim of this study was to address the sensitivity and underlying molecular changes of larvae of a key fisheries species, the sea bream Sparus aurata, towards ocean warming. Larvae were exposed to three temperatures: 18°C (control), 24°C (warm) and 30°C (heat wave) for seven days. At the end of the assay, i) survival curves were plotted for each temperature treatment and ii) entire larvae were collected for proteomic analysis via 2D gel electrophoresis, image analysis and mass spectrometry. Survival decreased with increasing temperature, with no larvae surviving at 30°C. Therefore, proteomic analysis was only carried out for 18°C and 24°C. Larvae up-regulated protein folding and degradation, cytoskeletal re-organization, transcriptional regulation and the growth hormone while mostly down-regulating cargo transporting and porphyrin metabolism upon exposure to heat stress. No changes were detected in proteins related to energetic metabolism suggesting that larval fish may not have the energetic plasticity needed to sustain cellular protection in the long-term. These results indicate that despite proteome modulation, S. aurata larvae do not seem able to fully acclimate to higher temperatures as shown by the low survival rates. Consequently, elevated temperatures seem to have bottleneck effects during fish early life stages, and future ocean warming can potentially compromise recruitment's success of key fisheries species.","The authors would like to thank Marta Martins, Ana Patrícia and Carolina Madeira for the help given in the maintenance of experimental systems and feeding of the organisms.

Agardh) Setchell","Biomechanical models that describe physical and biological interactions on wave-exposed shores typically assume that a species' attachment properties are similar between seasons and sites. We tested this assumption using Hedophyllum sessile to investigate how macroalgal biomechanical attachment properties vary with developmental stage, substratum-type, season, and wave-exposure. Hedophyllum sessile is an intertidal kelp species that is able to survive in wave-exposed areas in the Northeast Pacific. For both juveniles and adults, holdfast attachment force and strength were measured at a wave-exposed and wave-protected site in Barkley Sound, British Columbia, Canada. Substratum and wave-exposure effects on attachment properties were tested in juvenile populations. Adult populations were sampled prior to (in July 1996) and after (in November 1996) a series of storms. Site and seasonal wave-exposure effects on attachment properties were tested in these adult populations. Comparisons to known attachment properties of other temperate macroalgal species were also made. Causes for these patterns are discussed but were not isolated in these studies. Juveniles' attachment properties differed on different substrata types and between wave-exposures, with the highest attachment forces and the most attached juveniles in articulated coralline algal turfs. Adult attachment is firm ( approximately 100 N), but relatively weak ( approximately 0.07 MNm(-2)). Adult attachment did not vary with site wave-exposure, but there was a shift within each site to more resistant holdfasts after a series of early winter storms. Seasonal increases in storm swells correlated to more thallus tattering and selected against large, loose holdfasts. The data presented here suggest that results from holdfast attachment field studies in one season cannot be extrapolated to another due to a complex set of dynamics. This is the first documentation of seasonal patterns in macroalgal attachment properties.","Field work was often during heavy seas and foul weather.

Only certain arthropods are resilient to the urbanization process and can thrive in the novel conditions of urbanized landscapes. However, the degree to which arthropod communities survive in urban habitats depends on landscape and local effects and biological interactions (e.g., trophic interactions). In the present study, we examined the relative importance of various factors at landscape (isolation, edge density and area of surrounding greenery) and local (size of park, canopy cover, understory vegetation cover, defoliation depth, weight of dried leaves, soil temperature, soil moisture, and soil pH) spatial scales on the diversity of ants, beetles and spiders in urban parks. Our results indicated that park edge density was negatively correlated with diversity metrics in ants, beetles, and spiders in urban parks relative to the degree of proximity with the peri-urban forest. In other words, parks that located adjacent to the peri-urban forest may not necessarily have high biodiversity. The results suggested that man-made structures have been effective dispersal barriers that limit the spillover effects of ants and spiders but not the spillover of comparatively strong fliers, such as beetles. However, the area of surrounding greenery may have facilitated the colonization of forest-dependent taxa in distant parks. Large parks with reduced edge density supported a higher arthropod diversity because of the minimal edge effect and increased habitat heterogeneity. Vegetation structure consistently explained the variability of ants, beetles, and spiders, indicating that understory plant litter is crucial for providing shelters and hibernation, oviposition, and foraging sites for the major taxa in urban parks. Therefore, efforts should focus on the local management of ground features to maximize the conservation of biological control in urban landscapes.","We thank Wan-Xuan Li (NCHU) for her technical assistance in the field sampling.

They occur in ecosystems that are largely structured by the climatic regime, the physical and chemical environments with which they interact, and the biological interactions that occur within them. Amphibian larvae are most present in standing water habitats where they are important primary and secondary consumers and even predators. Studies conducted in America and Europe have shown that tadpoles play an important role in the regulation of the algal community structure and water quality in ecosystems. This article aimed to study the effects of the physicochemical variables and tadpole assemblages of four species on microalgae in artificial freshwater ponds using an experimental approach in the Pendjari area, a flora and fauna reserve located in the extreme north-west of Benin.ResultsThe species of phytoplankton and periphyton recorded in ponds were among the taxonomical groups of chlorophytes, cyanophytes, euglenophytes, diatoms and dinoflagellates. Chlorophytes were the dominant group in the algal communities. Physicochemical variables affected the biomass of the different communities of algae in temporary freshwater ponds. Transparency and pond size were the most determinative variables of the structure of microalgae communities in ponds. Tadpoles of Kassina fusca, Ptychadena. bibroni, and Phrynomantis microps were important for the regulation of the water quality and algal community structure by grazing and filter-feeding.ConclusionsA decrease in the tadpole population in the artificial temporary ponds due to predation by carnivorous tadpoles of Hoplobatrachus occipitalis caused a disturbance of the algal community structure. This means that the decline of the amphibian population will critically lead to the impoverishment of ecosystems, thereby negatively influencing aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.","This study was funded by the BIOLOG-program of the German Ministry of Education and Science (BMB + F; Project BIOTA III, amphibians).

It seems likely that environmental signals induce a variety of mechanistic responses that influence ontogenetic processes. Inducible defenses, in which prey animals alter their morphology, behavior and/or other traits to help protect against direct or latent predation threats, are among the most striking examples of phenotypic plasticity. The freshwater microcrustacean Daphnia pulex forms tooth-like defensive structures, ""neckteeth,"" in response to chemical cues or signals, referred to as ""kairomones,"" in this case released from phantom midge larvae, a predator of D. pulex. To identify factors involved in the reception and/or transmission of a kairomone, we used microarray analysis to identify genes up-regulated following a short period of exposure to the midge kairomone. In addition to identifying differentially expressed genes of unknown function, we also found significant up-regulation of genes encoding ionotropic glutamate receptors, which are known to be involved in neurotransmission in many animal species. Specific antagonists of these receptors strongly inhibit the formation of neckteeth in D. pulex, although agonists did not induce neckteeth by themselves, indicating that ionotropic glutamate receptors are necessary but not sufficient for early steps of neckteeth formation in D. pulex. Moreover, using co-exposure of D. pulex to antagonists and juvenile hormone (JH), which physiologically mediates neckteeth formation, we found evidence suggesting that the inhibitory effect of antagonists is not due to direct inhibition of JH synthesis/secretion. Our findings not only provide a candidate molecule required for the inducible defense response in D. pulex, but also will contribute to the understanding of complex mechanisms underlying the recognition of environmental changes, which form the basis of phenotypic plasticity.","Support was provided to TI by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) (No. 24370029) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (http://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-grants/index.html).

Otolith microstructure and gut content analysis of larval lightfish Maurolicus parvipinnis and rockfish Sebastes oculatus were studied. Larval M. parvipinnis showed similar growth rates in both regions (0.13-0.15 mm d(-1)), but in NB larvae were larger-at-age than in SB. Larval S. oculatus showed no differences in size-at-age and larval growth (0.16 and 0.11 mm d(-1) for NB and SB, respectively). M. parvipinnis larvae from NB had larger number of prey items (mostly invertebrate eggs), similar total volume in their guts and smaller prey size than larvae collected in SB (mainly calanoid copepods). Larval S. oculatus had similar number, volume and body width of prey ingested at both basins, although prey ingestion rate by size was 5 times larger in NB than in SB, and prey composition varied from nauplii in NB to copepodites in SB. This study provides evidence that physical-biological interactions during larval stages of marine fishes from Chilean Patagonia are species-specific, and that in some cases large size-at-age correspond to increasing foraging success.","We appreciate the help in the collection of samples of María Inés Muñoz and Dr. Leonardo R.

We examined the linkage between climate and interspecific plant interactions in New England salt marshes. Because harsh edaphic conditions in marshes can be ameliorated by neighboring plants, plant neighbors can have net competitive or facilitative interactions, depending on ambient physical stresses. In particular, high soil salinities, which are largely controlled by solar radiation and the evaporation of marsh porewater, can be ameliorated by plant neighbors under stressful conditions leading to facilitative interactions. Under less stressful edaphic conditions, these same neighbors may be competitors. In this paper, we use this mechanistic understanding of marsh plant interactions to examine the hypothesis that latitudinal and inter-annual variation in climate can influence the nature and strength of marsh plant species interactions. We quantified the relationship between climate and species interactions by transplanting marsh plants into ambient vegetation and unvegetated bare patches at sites north and south of Cape Cod, a major biogeographic barrier on the east coast of North America. We hypothesized that the cooler climate north of Cape Cod would lead to fewer positive interactions among marsh plants. We found both latitudinal and inter-annual variation in the neighbor relations of marsh plants that paralleled latitudinal differences in temperature and salinity. South of Cape Cod, plant neighbor interactions tended to be more facilitative, whereas north of Cape Cod, plant neighbor interactions were more competitive. At all sites, soil salinity increased and plant neighbor interactions were more facilitative in warmer versus cooler years. Our results show that interspecific interactions can be strikingly linked to climate, but also reveal that because the sensitivity of specific species interactions to climatic variation is highly variable, predicting how entire communities will respond to climate change will be difficult, even in relatively simple, well-studied systems.",,,Oecologia,,Springer Nature,"0029-8549, 1432-1939",,2002-08-01,2002,2002-08-01,2002-08,132,3,392-401,Closed,Article,"Bertness, Mark D.; Ewanchuk, Patrick J.","Bertness, Mark D.

Here, we test for direct and indirect climatic drivers on competitive impact of Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus L.) on brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) along a climate gradient in central Scandinavia, spanning from coastal to high-alpine environments. As a measure of competitive impact, trout food consumption was measured using 137Cs tracer methodology both during the ice-covered and ice-free periods, and contrasted between lakes with or without char coexistence along the climate gradient. Variation in food consumption between lakes was best described by a linear mixed effect model including a three-way interaction between the presence/absence of Arctic char, season and Secchi depth. The latter is proxy for terrestrial dissolved organic carbon run-off, strongly governed by climatic properties of the catchment. The presence of Arctic char had a negative impact on trout food consumption. However, this effect was stronger during ice-cover and in lakes receiving high carbon load from the catchment, whereas no effect of water temperature was evident. In conclusion, the length of the ice-covered period and the export of allochthonous material from the catchment are likely major, but contrasting, climatic drivers of the competitive interaction between two freshwater lake top predators. While future climatic scenarios predict shorter ice-cover duration, they also predict increased carbon run-off. The present study therefore emphasizes the complexity of cascading ecosystem effects in future effects of climate change on freshwater ecosystems.","We thank M. Teichert, I. P. Helland, R.

The exposed sandy beach is an example of a physically rigorous environment where biological interactions have long been considered insignificant. We examined the interaction between the infaunal clam, Donax variabilis, and the hydroid, Lovenella gracilis, on exposed sandy beaches in North Carolina. Epibiotic occupation of Donax by hydroids has been repeatedly observed on ocean beaches but rarely investigated. By providing a stable substrate for attachment, the clam facilitates the persistence of the hydroid in the intertidal beach; however, benefits or costs experienced by the host as a result of this association are unknown. By exposing clams with and without hydroid colonies to multiple types of clam predators, we tested the effectiveness of the hydroid, which possesses stinging nematocysts, in defending its host. The hydroid defended the clam against one common predator, the Florida pompano (Trachinotus carolinus). Against speckled crabs (Arenaeus cribrarius) and ghost crabs (Ocypode quadrata), however, the hydroid offered no protection for its host and instead facilitated predation. The epibiotic hydroid, which projects above the surface of the sand, allowed the crabs to more readily detect clams below the surface. In the field, we evaluated the effect of the hydroid on the tidally synchronized migrations and burrowing speed of the clam. The hydroid, which can form large colonies on the posterior end of the clam, had no effect on Donax burrowing speed, but did reduce the speed of transport of clams by wave swash. Depending on relative predation pressure, the occupation of D. variabilis by L. gracilis can alternately be characterized as beneficial or detrimental to the host.","Financial support for this work came from NSF Biological Oceanography grant no.

Synechococcus are dominant marine phototrophs, and they are frequently associated with heterotrophic bacteria. These co-cultures provide a useful research system to investigate photoautotroph-heterotroph interactions in marine systems. Bacteria within the Roseobacter clade and Flavobacteria are two of the main bacterial lineages that exhibit intimate associations with Synechococcus populations. We conducted metagenomic analyses of a Synechococcus culture, followed by genomic binning of metagenomic contigs, and recovered five nearly complete genomes, including members of the Roseobacter clade (i.e. Marivita sp. XM-24) and Flavobacteria (i.e. Fluviicola sp. XM-24). Marivita sp. XM-24 is an ecological generalist of the Roseobacter clade and displays diverse metabolic capacities for the acquisition of nutrients and energy sources. Specifically, the genome contained numerous gene complements involved in the uptake and metabolism of nitrogen- and phosphorus-containing inorganic and organic compounds, in addition to the potential for aerobic anoxygenic photosynthesis, oxidation of carbon monoxide, inorganic sulfur oxidation, DMSP demethylation and PHA metabolism. The genome of the Flavobacteria representative, Fluviicola sp. XM-24, contained numerous peptidases, glycoside hydrolases, adhesion-related proteins and genes involved in gliding motility. Fluviicola sp. XM-24 likely specialize in the degradation of high molecular weight compound exudates from Synechococcus cells, including polysaccharides and polypeptides via attachment to particles, surfaces or cells. The distinct metabolic strategies identified within several heterotrophic bacteria that are associated with Syneochococcus cells provide insights into their lifestyles and nutrient utilization patterns, in addition to their interactions with photoautotrophs. Biological interactions, including mutualism, competition and antagonism, shape the microbial community structure of marine environments and are critical for understanding biogeochemical cycling in the ocean. These results provide valuable insights into the nature of interactions between dominant marine photoautotrophs and associated bacterial heterotrophs.","We would like to thank Ms Xiaoyun Huang for drawing the Fig. 3.

Some of these interactions are relevant in ecological terms and in biotechnological applications, such as biocontrol, where Trichoderma could be considered as an invasive species that colonizes a recipient community. The success of this invasion depends on multiple factors, which can be assayed using experimental communities as study models. Therefore, the aim of this work is to develop a species-specific sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker to monitor the colonization and growth of T. cf. harzianum when it invades experimental communities. For this study, 16 randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) primers of 10-mer were used to generate polymorphic patterns, one of which generated a band present only in strains of T. cf. harzianum. This band was cloned, sequenced, and five primers of 20–23 mer were designed. Primer pairs 2F2/2R2 and 2F2/2R3 successfully and specifically amplified fragments of 278 and 448 bp from the T. cf. harzianum BpT10a strain DNA, respectively. Both primer pairs were also tested against the DNA from 14 strains of T. cf. harzianum and several strains of different fungal genera as specificity controls. Only the DNA from the strains of T. cf. harzianum was successfully amplified. Moreover, primer pair 2F2/2R2 was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using fungal DNA mixtures and DNA extracted from fungal experimental communities as templates. T. cf. harzianum was detectable even when as few as 100 copies of the SCAR marker were available or even when its population represented only 0.1% of the whole community.",,,Journal of Zhejiang University-SCIENCE B,,Zhejiang University Press,"1673-1581, 1862-1783","Base Sequence; DNA Fingerprinting; DNA Primers; DNA, Fungal; Genetic Markers; Molecular Sequence Data; Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Species Specificity; Trichoderma",2014-11-09,2014,2014-11-09,2014-11,15,11,966-978,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Pérez, Gabriel; Verdejo, Valentina; Gondim-Porto, Clarissa; Orlando, Julieta; Carú, Margarita","Pérez, Gabriel (Department of Ecological Sciences, Faculty of Sciences, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile); Verdejo, Valentina (Department of Ecological Sciences, Faculty of Sciences, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile); Gondim-Porto, Clarissa (Department of Ecological Sciences, Faculty of Sciences, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile); Orlando, Julieta (Department of Ecological Sciences, Faculty of Sciences, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile); Carú, Margarita (Department of Ecological Sciences, Faculty of Sciences, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile)","Carú, Margarita (University of Chile)","Pérez, Gabriel (University of Chile); Verdejo, Valentina (University of Chile); Gondim-Porto, Clarissa (University of Chile); Orlando, Julieta (University of Chile); Carú, Margarita (University of Chile)",University of Chile,grid.443909.3,Santiago,,Chile,Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo,,Chile,grant.9273244,1120508,9,3,0.29,0.94,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1631%2Fjzus.B1400063.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1023837025,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3107 Microbiology,Rare Diseases,,,,,"A03 Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy",
1995,pub.1053193141,10.1007/bf00345306,28309235,,,The role of burrowing sponges in bioerosion,"Among the large number of limestone-eroding organisms, sponges, mainly of the family Clinonidae are of special interest because of their efficient means of substratum penetration by cellular etching and because they release characteristically shaped calcium carbonate chips which can be detected in the mud-size fraction of many sediments. Identifiable trace fossils and sediments are of great ecological and paleoecological significance.As new data on the excavating mechanism have become available, the questions of burrowing rates and sediment production have gained importance. Extrapolation from shortterm experiments (under 6 months) on substrate invasion are inconclusive because of high initial penetration rates resulting from mechanical stimulation and lack of competition. New experiments show that the rate curve flattens after 6 months and that optimum longterm erosion of CaCO3 does not exceed 700 mg m-2 year-1 (Cliona lampa and C. aprica). Substrate limitations and competition will further reduce this rate.By monitoring the production of CaCO3 chips by Cliona lampa, it was possible to link activity patterns to certain environmental factors. Mechanical stimuli, high light intensity, strong currents and, possibly, low temperature seem to accelerate the burrowing process. Sponge-generated chips can make up over 40% of coral mud when deposited in the current shadow of the reef framework.Using transect counts and sponge area-biomass conversion factors, the mean abundance of burrowing sponges on the Bermuda platform could be calculated. On suitable hard bottom substrates it averages 16 g dry weight per m2. From this value the burrowing potential of sponges can be estimated as 256 g CaCO3 per m2 substrate per year. Since 97–98% of the eroded limestone remains in particulate form, the contribution of fine sediments can amount to 250 g m-2 year-1.Attention is called to the fact that erosion rates by burrowers can not directly be compared with those of borers or scrapers. The former are intermittent and their activities are affected by environmental and biological interactions, while activities of the latter are rather constant and guided by the need for food.",,,Oecologia,,Springer Nature,"0029-8549, 1432-1939",,1975-09,1975,,1975-09,19,3,203-216,Closed,Article,"Rützler, Klaus","Rützler, Klaus (Department of Invertebrate Zoology, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, 20560, Washington, D.C.)",,"Rützler, Klaus (National Museum of Natural History)",National Museum of Natural History,grid.453560.1,Washington D.C.,District of Columbia,United States,,,,,,153,12,0.96,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1053193141,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,

Such knowledge can be gained through studies of spatial population dynamics at climatic range margins. Here, using a butterfly (Pyrgus armoricanus) as model species, we first predicted based on species distribution modelling that its climatically suitable habitats currently extend north of its realized range. Projecting the model into scenarios of future climate, we showed that the distribution of climatically suitable habitats may shift northward by an additional 400 km in the future. Second, we used a 13-year monitoring dataset including the majority of all habitat patches at the species northern range margin to assess the synergetic impact of temperature fluctuations and spatial distribution of habitat, microclimatic conditions and habitat quality, on abundance and colonization-extinction dynamics. The fluctuation in abundance between years was almost entirely determined by the variation in temperature during the species larval development. In contrast, colonization and extinction dynamics were better explained by patch area, between-patch connectivity and host plant density. This suggests that the response of the species to future climate change may be limited by future land use and how its host plants respond to climate change. It is, thus, probable that dispersal limitation will prevent P. armoricanus from reaching its potential future distribution. We argue that models of range dynamics should consider the factors influencing metapopulation dynamics, especially at the range edges, and not only broad-scale climate. It includes factors acting at the scale of habitat patches such as habitat quality and microclimate and landscape-scale factors such as the spatial configuration of potentially suitable patches. Knowledge of population dynamics under various environmental conditions, and the incorporation of realistic scenarios of future land use, appears essential to provide predictions useful for actions mitigating the negative effects of climate change.","The authors thank Harriet Arnberg, Erik Cronvall, Åse Dannestam, Silke Eilers, Stefan Jarl, Per Karlsson, Anna Knöppel, Sara Leinerud, Mikael Molander, Josefin Olsson, Janielle Porter, Cecilia Ronnås and Annika Söderman for their assistance with the butterfly monitoring over the years.

1995,pub.1124333032,10.1007/s00572-020-00934-2,31982950,,,Orchids and their mycorrhizal fungi: an insufficiently explored relationship,"Orchids are associated with diverse fungal taxa, including nonmycorrhizal endophytic fungi as well as mycorrhizal fungi. The orchid mycorrhizal (OM) symbiosis is an excellent model for investigating the biological interactions between plants and fungi due to their high dependency on these symbionts for growth and survival. To capture the complexity of OM interactions, significant genomic, numerous transcriptomic, and proteomic studies have been performed, unraveling partly the role of each partner. On the other hand, several papers studied the bioactive metabolites from each partner but rarely interpreted their significance in this symbiotic relationship. In this review, we focus from a biochemical viewpoint on the OM dynamics and its molecular interactions. The ecological functions of OM in plant development and stress resistance are described first, summarizing recent literature. Secondly, because only few studies have specifically looked on OM molecular interactions, the signaling pathways and compounds allowing the establishment/maintenance of mycorrhizal association involved in arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) are discussed in parallel with OM. Based on mechanistic similarities between OM and AM, and recent findings on orchids’ endophytes, a putative model representing the different molecular strategies that OM fungi might employ to establish this association is proposed. It is hypothesized here that (i) orchids would excrete plant molecule signals such as strigolactones and flavonoids but also other secondary metabolites; (ii) in response, OM fungi would secrete mycorrhizal factors (Myc factors) or similar compounds to activate the common symbiosis genes (CSGs); (iii) overcome the defense mechanism by evasion of the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)-triggered immunity and by secretion of effectors such as small inhibitor proteins; and (iv) finally, secrete phytohormones to help the colonization or disrupt the crosstalk of plant defense phytohormones. To challenge this putative model, targeted and untargeted metabolomics studies with special attention to each partner’s contribution are finally encouraged and some technical approaches are proposed.","We thank Ludivine Riffault-Valois, Aurélie Urbain, Laurence Gondet (Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Strasbourg), and Megan Krumpoch for their critical reading and revision of the manuscript.",This research was financially supported by Guerlain to contribute in the understanding and preservation of orchids.,Mycorrhiza,,Springer Nature,"0940-6360, 1432-1890",Endophytes; Fungi; Mycorrhizae; Orchidaceae; Proteomics; Symbiosis,2020-01-25,2020,2020-01-25,2020-01,30,1,5-22,Closed,Article,"Favre-Godal, Quentin; Gourguillon, Lorène; Lordel-Madeleine, Sonia; Gindro, Katia; Choisy, Patrick","Favre-Godal, Quentin (LVMH recherche, Innovation Matériaux Naturels et Développement Durable, 185 avenue de Verdun, 45800, St Jean de Braye, France; CNRS, IPHC UMR 7178, Chimie analytique des molécules bioactives et pharmacognosie, Université de Strasbourg, F-67000, Strasbourg, France); Gourguillon, Lorène (LVMH recherche, Innovation Matériaux Naturels et Développement Durable, 185 avenue de Verdun, 45800, St Jean de Braye, France); Lordel-Madeleine, Sonia (CNRS, IPHC UMR 7178, Chimie analytique des molécules bioactives et pharmacognosie, Université de Strasbourg, F-67000, Strasbourg, France); Gindro, Katia (Agroscope, Swiss Federal Research Station, Plant Protection, 60 Route de Duiller, PO Box, 1260, Nyon, Switzerland); Choisy, Patrick (LVMH recherche, Innovation Matériaux Naturels et Développement Durable, 185 avenue de Verdun, 45800, St Jean de Braye, France)","Favre-Godal, Quentin (; University of Strasbourg)","Favre-Godal, Quentin (University of Strasbourg); Gourguillon, Lorène (); Lordel-Madeleine, Sonia (University of Strasbourg); Gindro, Katia (Agroscope); Choisy, Patrick ()",Agroscope; University of Strasbourg,grid.417771.3; grid.11843.3f,Bern; Strasbourg,; Alsace,Switzerland; France,,,,,,41,39,2.65,10.74,3,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124333032,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3107 Microbiology; 3108 Plant Biology,,,,,,A05 Biological Sciences,

Describing the biodiversity of multi-trophic biota in pelagic zone of the Black Sea and identifying the dominant environmental factors are prerequisites for protecting the sustainability of ecosystems. However, up to now, the taxonomic and distributional information about the Black Sea biota is not clear. Here, we employed a Tree-of-Life metabarcoding to analyze the biodiversity of eight communities in the Black Sea, investigated their biogeographical distribution, and further analyzed the influence of biological and abiotic factors on biota on large scales. We found that, (1) Over 8900 OTUs were detected in the Black Sea, of which 630 species were identified, covering the holistic biota from single-celled (bacteria 5620 OTUs 141 species; algae 1096 OTUs 185 species; protozoa 546 OTUs 146 species) to multicellular organisms (invertebrate metazoans 150 OTUs 34 species; fishes 1369 OTUs 76 species; large marine mammals 39 OTUs 5 species). (2) Higher trophic organisms (fishes and large mammals) distributed more evenly in space than the lower (microorganisms, protozoa and invertebrates). For lower trophic organisms, the vertical stratification was more obvious than the horizontal stratification (vertical p < 0.02, horizontal p < 0.05). (3) The bottom trophic organisms (bacteria and algae) of the food web significantly affected the distribution and composition of the others through biological interactions (Mantel p < 0.05). (4) At the level of abiotic factors, the effect of local species sorting on the composition of communities was 15% higher than that of mass dispersal effect. For the first time, this study monitored and profiled the holistic biodiversity in the pelagic zone of the Black Sea, and provided technological advances and preliminary knowledge for the ongoing Black Sea ecosystem protection efforts.","For support, we would like to thank the EU/UNDP Project Improving Environmental Monitoring in the Black Sea – Phase II (EMBLAS-II; ENPI/2013/313-169), and Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment (Grant#2018ZX07208-002).

However, scarce empirical evidence and model systems have left the phage-mucus interaction poorly understood. Here, we show that phages bind both to porcine mucus and to rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) primary mucus, persist up to 7 days in the mucosa, and provide protection against Flavobacterium columnare Also, exposure to mucus changes the bacterial phenotype by increasing bacterial virulence and susceptibility to phage infections. This trade-off in bacterial virulence reveals ecological benefit of maintaining phages in the metazoan mucosal surfaces. Tests using other phage-bacterium pairs suggest that phage binding to mucus may be widespread in the biosphere, indicating its importance for disease, ecology, and evolution. This phenomenon may have significant potential to be exploited in preventive phage therapy.IMPORTANCE The mucosal surfaces of animals are habitat for microbes, including viruses. Bacteriophages-viruses that infect bacteria-were shown to be able to bind to mucus. This may result in a symbiotic relationship in which phages find bacterial hosts to infect, protecting the mucus-producing animal from bacterial infections in the process. Here, we studied phage binding on mucus and the effect of mucin on phage-bacterium interactions. The significance of our research is in showing that phage adhesion to mucus results in preventive protection against bacterial infections, which will serve as basis for the development of prophylactic phage therapy approaches. Besides, we also reveal that exposure to mucus upregulates bacterial virulence and that this is exploited by phages for infection, adding one additional layer to the metazoan-bacterium-phage biological interactions and ecology. This phenomenon might be widespread in the biosphere and thus crucial for understanding mucosal diseases, their outcome and treatment.","We thank Jean-Francois Bernardet (INRA, France), Mark McBride (University of Wisconsin—Milwaukee, USA) and Mathias Middelboe (University of Copenhagen, Denmark) for kindly donating bacterial and phage strains (Table S1), Jonatan Pirhonen, Ville Hoikkala, Heidi Kunttu, and Anniina Runtuvuori for technical help, and Jeremy Barr (Monash University, Australia) for valuable comments.

Numerous species exhibit daily cycles or strong scototaxic behaviours that could potentially be influenced if natural lighting conditions or cycles are disrupted. Artificial Light Pollution at Night (ALAN) stands for situations where artificial light alters natural light-dark cycles, as well as light intensities and wavelengths. ALAN is increasingly recognized as a potential threat to biodiversity, mainly because a growing number of studies are demonstrating its influence on animal behaviour, migration, reproduction and biological interactions. Most of these studies have focused on terrestrial organisms and ecosystems with studies on the effects of ALAN on marine ecosystems being more occasional. However, with the increasing human use and development of the coastal zone, organisms that inhabit shallow coastal or intertidal systems could be at increasing risk from ALAN. In this study we measured the levels of artificial light intensity in the field and used these levels to conduct experimental trials to determine the impact of ALAN on an intertidal fish. Specifically, we measured ALAN effects on physiological performance (oxygen consumption) and behaviour (activity patterns) of ""Baunco"" the rockfish Girella laevifrons, one of the most abundant and ecologically important intertidal fish in the Southeastern Pacific littoral. Our results indicated that individuals exposed to ALAN exhibited increased oxygen consumption and activity when compared with control animals. Moreover, those fish exposed to ALAN stopped displaying the natural (circatidal and circadian) activity cycles that were observed in control fish throughout the experiment. These changes in physiological function and behaviour could have serious implications for the long-term sustainability of fish populations and indirect impacts on intertidal communities in areas affected by ALAN.","We thank to two anonymous reviewers for their comments on an earlier version of this manuscript.

This limits biological interactions to a subset of “rugged” and mostly immotile fauna. As the deep sea is one of the most biologically diverse and least studied ecosystems on the planet, there is much room for innovation in facilitating delicate interactions with a multitude of organisms. The biodiversity and physiology of shallow marine systems, such as coral reefs, are common study targets due to the easier nature of access; SCUBA diving allows for in situ delicate human interactions. Beyond the range of technical SCUBA (~150 m), the ability to achieve the same level of human dexterity using robotic systems becomes critically important. The deep ocean is navigated primarily by manned submersibles or remotely operated vehicles, which currently offer few options for delicate manipulation. Here we present results in developing a soft robotic manipulator for deep-sea biological sampling. This low-power glove-controlled soft robot was designed with the future marine biologist in mind, where science can be conducted at a comparable or better means than via a human diver and at depths well beyond the limits of SCUBA. The technology relies on compliant materials that are matched with the soft and fragile nature of marine organisms, and uses seawater as the working fluid. Actuators are driven by a custom proportional-control hydraulic engine that requires less than 50 W of electrical power, making it suitable for battery-powered operation. A wearable glove master allows for intuitive control of the arm. The manipulator system has been successfully operated in depths exceeding 2300 m (3500 psi) and has been field-tested onboard a manned submersible and unmanned remotely operated vehicles. The design, development, testing, and field trials of the soft manipulator is placed in context with existing systems and we offer suggestions for future work based on these findings.","This study was funded by NSF Instrument Development for Biological Research Award #s 1556164 to R.J.

Here, we examine the bacterial community inhabiting free-living and particle-associated seawater microenvironments at the Pivers Island Coastal Observatory (PICO). 16S rRNA gene libraries from monthly samples (July 2013 to August 2014) were used to identify microbes in seawater in four size fractions: >63 μm (zooplankton and large particles), 63 to 5 μm (particles), 5 to 1 μm (small particles/dividing cells), and <1 μm (free-living prokaryotes). Analyses of microbial community composition highlight the importance of the microhabitat (e.g., particle-associated versus free-living lifestyle) as communities cluster by size fraction, and the microhabitat explains more of the community variability than measured environmental parameters, including pH, particle concentration, projected daily insolation, nutrients, and temperature. While temperature is statistically associated with community changes in the <1-μm and 5- to 1-μm fractions, none of the measured bulk seawater environmental variables are statistically significant in the larger-particle-associated fractions. These results, combined with high particle-associated community variability, especially in the largest size fraction (i.e., >63 μm), suggest that particle composition, including eukaryotes and their associated microbiomes, may be an important factor in selecting for specific particle-associated bacteria.
IMPORTANCE: By comparing levels of particle-associated and free-living bacterial diversity at a coastal location over the course of 14 months, we show that bacteria associated with particles are generally more diverse and appear to be less responsive to commonly measured environmental variables than free-living bacteria. These diverse and highly variable particle-associated communities are likely driven by differences in particle substrates both within the water column at a single time point and due to seasonal changes over the course of the year.",We thank the entire PICO team for help with sampling.

Environmental DNA sequencing of archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA genes was conducted on samples from multiple evaporite sediment layers collected from the upper 30 cm of the surface salt crust. Our results show that at the time of sampling (September 2016), BSF hosted a robust microbial community dominated by diverse halobacteria and Salinibacter species. Sequences identical to Geitlerinema sp. strain PCC 9228, an anoxygenic cyanobacterium that uses sulfide as the electron donor for photosynthesis, are also abundant in many samples. We identified taxonomic groups enriched in each layer of the salt crust sediment and revealed that the upper gypsum sediment layer found immediately under the uppermost surface halite contains a robust microbial community. In these sediments, we found an increased presence of Thermoplasmatales, Hadesarchaeota, Nanoarchaeaeota, Acetothermia, Desulfovermiculus, Halanaerobiales, Bacteroidetes, and Rhodovibrio This study provides insight into the diversity, spatial heterogeneity, and geologic context of a surprisingly complex microbial ecosystem within this macroscopically sterile landscape.IMPORTANCE Pleistocene Lake Bonneville, which covered a third of Utah, desiccated approximately 13,000 years ago, leaving behind the Bonneville Salt Flats (BSF) in the Utah West Desert. The potash salts that saturate BSF basin are extracted and sold as an additive for agricultural fertilizers. The salt crust is a well-known recreational and economic commodity, but the biological interactions with the salt crust have not been studied. This study is the first geospatial analysis of microbially diverse populations at this site using cultivation-independent environmental DNA sequencing methods. Identification of the microbes present within this unique, dynamic, and valued sedimentary evaporite environment is an important step toward understanding the potential consequences of perturbations to the microbial ecology on the surrounding landscape and ecosystem.","This research was supported by the National Science Foundation Award 1617473 (CNH-L: Adaptation, Mitigation, and Biophysical Feedbacks in the Changing Bonneville Salt Flats).

In seasonal ice environments, there is evidence that polar bear predation of Arctic bird eggs is increasing because of earlier sea ice breakup, which forces polar bears into nearshore terrestrial environments where Arctic birds are nesting. Because polar bears can consume a large number of nests before becoming satiated, and because they can swim between island colonies, they could have dramatic influences on seabird and sea duck reproductive success. However, it is unclear whether nest foraging can provide an energetic benefit to polar bear populations, especially given the capacity of bird populations to redistribute in response to increasing predation pressure. In this study, we develop a spatially explicit agent-based model of the predator-prey relationship between polar bears and common eiders, a common and culturally important bird species for northern peoples. Our model is composed of two types of agents (polar bear agents and common eider hen agents) whose movements and decision heuristics are based on species-specific bioenergetic and behavioral ecological principles, and are influenced by historical and extrapolated sea ice conditions. Our model reproduces empirical findings that polar bear predation of bird nests is increasing and predicts an accelerating relationship between advancing ice breakup dates and the number of nests depredated. Despite increases in nest predation, our model predicts that polar bear body condition during the ice-free period will continue to decline. Finally, our model predicts that common eider nests will become more dispersed and will move closer to the mainland in response to increasing predation, possibly increasing their exposure to land-based predators and influencing the livelihood of local people that collect eider eggs and down. These results show that predator-prey interactions can have nonlinear responses to changes in climate and provides important predictions of ecological change in Arctic ecosystems.","This research was funded by a Mitacs Accelerate grant (in collaboration with Baffinlands Iron Mines) to HGG and CADS.

It is thus important to understand how interrelated taxa respond to land-use intensification and to consider the importance of different spatial scales. We investigated whether and how local land-use intensity and landscape features affect the predator-prey interaction of bats and insects. Bats and nocturnal insects were assessed on 50 grassland sites in the Schorfheide-Chorin. We analyzed the effect of local land use and distance to forested areas as a proxy for site accessibility on bats and insects and their biological interaction measured in bat's feeding activity. Insect abundance increased with higher land-use intensity, while size and diversity of insects decreased. In contrast, bat activity, diversity, and species composition were determined by the distance to forested areas and only slightly by land-use intensity. Feeding attempts of bats increased with higher insect abundance and diversity but decreased with insect size and distance to forested areas. Finally, our results revealed that near forested areas, the number of feeding attempts was much lower on grassland sites with high, compared to those with low land-use intensity. In contrast, far from forests, the feeding attempts did not differ significantly between intensively and extensively managed grassland sites. We conclude that the two interrelated taxa, bats and insects, respond to land-use intensification on very different scales. While insects respond to local land use, bats are rather influenced by surrounding landscape matrix. Hereby, proximity to forests reveals to be a prerequisite for higher bat species diversity and a higher rate of feeding attempts within the area. However, proximity to forest is not sufficient to compensate local high land-use intensity. Thus, local land-use intensification in combination with a loss of forest remnants weakens the interaction of bats and insects.","Acknowledgments This work was funded by the DFG Priority Program 1374 “Infrastructure‐Biodiversity‐Exploratories” (P3141044).

Understanding these alterations can help improve predictive capacity and inform management efforts designed to mitigate against negative impacts. We investigated how the movement and space use patterns of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in coastal areas in Svalbard, Norway, have been altered by a sudden decline in sea ice that occurred in 2006. We also investigated whether the spatial overlap between polar bears and their traditionally most important prey, ringed seals (Pusa hispida), has been affected by the sea-ice decline, as polar bears are dependent on a sea-ice platform for hunting seals. We attached biotelemetry devices to ringed seals (n = 60, both sexes) and polar bears (n = 67, all females) before (2002-2004) and after (2010-2013) a sudden decline in sea ice in Svalbard. We used linear mixed-effects models to evaluate the association of these species to environmental features and an approach based on Time Spent in Area to investigate changes in spatial overlap between the two species. Following the sea-ice reduction, polar bears spent the same amount of time close to tidal glacier fronts in the spring but less time in these areas during the summer and autumn. However, ringed seals did not alter their association with glacier fronts during summer, leading to a major decrease in spatial overlap values between these species in Svalbard's coastal areas. Polar bears now move greater distances daily and spend more time close to ground-nesting bird colonies, where bear predation can have substantial local effects. Our results indicate that sea-ice declines have impacted the degree of spatial overlap and hence the strength of the predator-prey relationship between polar bears and ringed seals, with consequences for the wider Arctic marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Shifts in ecological interactions are likely to become more widespread in many ecosystems as both predators and prey respond to changing environmental conditions induced by global warming, highlighting the importance of multi-species studies.","We thank Magnus Andersen, Lars Boehme, Heinrich Eggenfellner, Mike Fedak, Carla Freitas, Nils Christian Ravnaas Heen, Rupert Krapp, Hans Lund, Benjamin Merkel and Bobben Severinsen for their assistance in the field and Benjamin Merkel for preparation of the polar bear location data.

1907,pub.1003859372,10.1111/1365-2656.12161,24372171,,,Determination of temperate bird–flower interactions as entangled mutualistic and antagonistic sub‐networks: characterization at the network and species levels,"Most network studies on biological interactions consider only a single interaction type. However, individual species are simultaneously positioned in various types of interactions. The ways in which different network types are merged and entangled, and the variations in network structures between different sympatric networks, require full elucidation. Incorporating interaction types and disentangling complex networks is crucial, because the integration of various network architectures has the potential to alter the stability and co-evolutionary dynamics of the whole network. To reveal how different types of interaction networks are entangled, we focused on the interaction between birds and flowers of temperate plants in Japan, where flower-feeding birds are mainly generalist passerines, acting as pollinators and predators of flowers. Using long-term monitoring data, we investigated the flower-feeding episodes of birds. We constructed the whole network (WN) between birds and plants, separating the network into mutualistic and antagonistic sub-networks (MS and AS, respectively). We investigated structural properties of the three quantified networks and species-level characteristics of the main bird species. For bird species, we evaluated dietary similarity, dietary specialization and shifts of feeding behaviour relative to plant traits. Our results indicate that WN comprises entangled MS and AS, sharing considerable proportions of bird and plant assemblages. We observed distinctive differences in the network structural properties between the two sub-networks. In comparison with AS, MS had lower numbers of bird and plant species, showed lower specialization and modularity and exhibited higher nestedness. At the species level, the Japanese white-eye acted as pollinator, while the brown-eared bulbul acted as both pollinator and predator for large numbers of flowers, based on its behavioural plasticity. Overall, the pattern of avian feeding behaviour was influenced by flower size and plant origin. Birds showed nectarivory for plants with medium-sized flowers and exotic origins. Our results highlight the complex patterns of interactions between birds and the flowers of plants in temperate regions. They also indicate that understanding the interaction type for each species pair and consideration of the behavioural plasticity of animal species are important for elucidating integrated network structures.","We are indebted to the members of the Kanagawa Branch of the Wild Bird Society of Japan, for their tremendous efforts in collecting data.

In plant communities, interactions between individuals of different species are expected to generate positive or negative spatial interspecific associations over short distances. Recent studies using individual-based point pattern datasets have concluded that (a) detectable interspecific interactions are generally rare, but (b) are most common in communities with fewer species; and (c) the most abundant species tend to have the highest frequency of interactions. However, it is unclear how the detection of spatial interactions may change with the abundances of each species, or the scale and intensity of interactions. We ask if statistical power is sufficient to explain all three key results.We use a simple two-species model, assuming no habitat associations, and where the abundances, scale and intensity of interactions are controlled to simulate point pattern data. In combination with an approximation to the variance of the spatial summary statistics that we sample, we investigate the power of current spatial point pattern methods to correctly reject the null model of pairwise species independence.We show the power to detect interactions is positively related to both the abundances of the species tested, and the intensity and scale of interactions, but negatively related to imbalance in abundances. Differences in detection power in combination with the abundance distributions found in natural communities are sufficient to explain all the three key empirical results, even if all pairwise interactions are identical. Critically, many hundreds of individuals of both species may be required to detect even intense interactions, implying current abundance thresholds for including species in the analyses are too low. Sy n thesis. The widespread failure to reject the null model of spatial interspecific independence could be due to low power of the tests rather than any key biological process.

In this review, we have compiled and analyzed available research on how multiple stressor pairs composed of temperature (T), light (L), ultraviolet radiation (UVR), nutrients (Nut), carbon dioxide (CO2), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and salinity (S) impact the stoichiometry of autotrophs which in turn shapes the nature of their ecological interactions within lower trophic levels in streams, lakes and oceans. Our analysis from 66 studies with 320 observations of 11 stressor pairs, demonstrated that non-additive responses predominate across aquatic ecosystems and their net interactive effect depends on the stressor pair at play. Across systems, there was a prevalence of antagonism in freshwater (60-67% vs. 47% in marine systems) compared to marine systems where synergism was more common (49% vs. 33-40% in freshwaters). While the lack of data impeded comparisons among all of the paired stressors, we found pronounced system differences for the L × Nut interactions. For this interaction, our data for C:P and N:P is consistent with the initial hypothesis that the interaction was primarily synergistic in the oceans, but not for C:N. Our study found a wide range of variability in the net effects of the interactions in freshwater systems, with some observations supporting antagonism, and others synergism. Our results suggest that the nature of the stressor pairs interactions on C:N:P ratios regulates the ""continuum"" commensalistic-competitive-predatory relationship between algae and bacteria and the food chain efficiency at the algae-herbivore interface. Overall, the scarce number of studies with even more fewer replications in each study that are available for freshwater systems have prevented a more detailed, insightful analysis. Our findings highlighting the preponderance of antagonistic and synergistic effects of stressor interactions in aquatic ecosystems-effects that play key roles in the functioning of feedback loops in the biosphere-also stress the need for further studies evaluating the interactive effects of multiple stressors in a rapidly changing world facing a confluence of tipping points.","We are thankful for support of this work by the University of Granada, Spain and Grand Valley State University, USA.

We investigated the hypothesis that competitive interactions during burrowing could potentially affect the intertidal distribution and abundance of macroinfaunal animals of sandy beaches using two species of invertebrates, a hippid crab, Emerita analoga, and a bivalve, Mesodesma donacium, common along the coast of Chile. Spatial overlap in the intertidal distributions of these species was dynamic, varying with abundance, location, time of year and tide. Highest density zones of each species were often distinctly separated at low tide and spatial overlap in their distributions decreased significantly with increasing density, suggesting density dependence of the interactions. Negative relationships between densities of the two species at the smallest spatial scale examined also suggested active interactions among individuals. Over a tidal cycle, peak densities of the two species overlapped suggesting that interactions could occur frequently. Burrowing performance of E. analoga varied between size classes in three experimental densities of clams (5, 10 and 15 clams 0.008 m-2) and in controls with no clams. Burrowing times of large crabs were significantly longer (~twofold) in all densities of clams than in controls, while those of small crabs did not differ significantly among treatments and controls. Large crabs also displaced clams from the sand while burrowing suggesting that two mechanisms of direct interference can occur, both of which could increase exposure of individuals involved to active swash and transport across or along the beach with potentially negative consequences. Our results suggest that competitive interactions capable of affecting zonation and population and community biology on a number of scales can occur among burrowing macroinfauna on exposed sandy beaches. Those interactions could be more ecologically significant than previously appreciated and may contribute to patterns observed in community structure and zonation on sandy beaches. Our results illustrate the potential importance of negative biological interactions in a physically stressful environment.","We thank E. Daforno, M. H. Avellanal and S.

Records of Rhabdomys taxa across the study region were compiled and georeferenced from the literature, museum records, and field expeditions. Presence records were summarized within a 10 × 10 km grid covering the study area. Environmental information regarding climate, topography, land use, and vegetation productivity was gathered at the same resolution. Multivariate statistics were used to characterize the current environmental niche and distribution of the whole genus as well as of three mitochondrial lineages known to occur in southern Africa. Distribution modeling was carried out using MAXENT in order to generate hypotheses regarding current distribution of each taxa and their potential contact zones. Results indicate that the two species within Rhabdomys appear to have differentiated across the precipitation/temperature gradient present in the region from east to west. R. dilectus occupies the wettest areas in eastern southern Africa, while R. pumilio occupies the warmer and drier regions in the west, but also penetrates in the more mesic central part of the region. We provide further evidence of environmental differentiation within two lineages of R. dilectus. Contact zones between lineages appear to occur in areas of strong environmental gradients and topographic complexity, such as the transition zones between major biomes and the escarpment area where a sharp altitudinal gradient separates coastal and plateau areas, but also within more homogeneous areas such as within grassland and savannah biomes. Our results indicate that Rhabdomys may be more specialized than previously thought when considering current knowledge regarding mitochondrial lineages. The genus appears to have differentiated along two major environmental axes in the study region, but results also suggest dispersal limitations and biological interactions having a role in limiting current distribution boundaries. Furthermore, the projection of the potential geographic distribution of the different lineages suggests several contact zones that may be interesting study fields for understanding the interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes during speciation.",We thank all the museums listed in Appendix 1 for sharing kindly their data with us.

1905,pub.1010766370,10.1007/s004420100777,28547019,,,Physical habitat attribute mediates biotic resistance to non-indigenous species invasion,"A soft-shelled non-indigenous clam, Nuttallia obscurata, has invaded coastal soft-sediment habitats of the northeastern Pacific. In a survey of 35 sites within the San Juan Islands, Washington, USA, Nuttallia was found almost exclusively in sandy substrates, higher in the intertidal than most native clams (>1 m above mean lower low water). The  distinctive distribution of Nuttallia suggested that tidal height and sediment composition may be important physical factors that control its refuge availability, regulating its exposure to predation and ultimately the success of its invasion. I tethered Nuttallia for 24 h in the high intertidal where it is typically found and in the low intertidal at an elevation where it was never found. Clams restrained to the surface suffered high mortality from crab predation at both tidal heights, whereas control clams with unrestricted burrowing movement exhibited high mortality rates only in the low intertidal. In a second experiment, I transplanted sediment within and between the two intertidal heights to measure effects of tidal height and sediment type on survival and burial depth of Nuttallia. At both tidal heights all clams placed on mud-cobble substrate, naturally common in the low intertidal, suffered high mortality rates (>60% in 24 h). Nuttallia on loosely packed sand substrate, naturally found in the upper intertidal, survived much better, however, because they buried deeper than in the tightly packed mud. Caged control clams at both tidal heights suffered no mortality. Apparently native predators are mitigating community level impacts of an invader by excluding Nuttallia completely from some beaches with improper sediment characteristics or relegating it in others to a zone not often inhabited by native species, thereby reducing potential competitive interactions. These findings show that a physical habitat characteristic can mediate biotic resistance to an invader and thus control invasion success and community-level impacts. Generally, such physical-biological interactions may explain some of the reported site-to-site variability in invasion success, as well as the patchy distribution of many soft-sediment infaunal species.",,,Oecologia,,Springer Nature,"0029-8549, 1432-1939",,2002-01-01,2002,2002-01-01,2002-01,130,1,146-156,Closed,Article,"Byers, James E.","Byers, James E.

This study describes and analyzes the structure, species composition and soil characteristics of forest stands at different altitudinal zones in Southeastern Venezuelan Guayana, in order to explain the patterns and the main factors that determine the structure and composition of evergreen forests along the altitudinal gradient. Inventories of 3 948 big (>10cm DBH) and 1 328 small (5-10cm DBH) woody stems were carried out in eleven plots, ranging from 0.1 to 1.0ha, along a 188km long transect with elevations between 290 and 1 395masl. It has been found that 1) hemiepihytes become more dominant and lianas reduce their dominance with increasing altitude and 2) the forest structure in the study area is size-dependent. Five families and 12 genera represented only 9% of the total number of families and genera, respectively, recorded troughout the gradient, but the two groups of taxa comprised more than 50% of the Importance Value (the sum of the relative density and the relative dominance) of all measured stems. Moreover, the results suggest that low species richness seems to be associated with the dominance of one or few species. Stand-level wood density (WD) of trees decreased significantly with increasing elevation. WD is an indicator of trees'life history strategy. Its decline suggests a change in the functional composition of the forest with increasing altitude. The Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) indicated a distinction of the studied forests on the basis of their altitudinal levels and geographic location, and revealed different ecological responses by the forests, to environmental variables along the altitudinal gradient. The variation in species composition, in terms of basal area among stands, was controlled primarily by elevation and secondarily by rainfall and soil conditions. There are other interacting factors not considered in this study like disturbance regime, biological interactions, productivity, and dispersal history, which could affect the structure and composition of the forests in the altitudinal gradient. In conclusion, it appears that the structural and floristic variability observed in the studied transect is produced by a combination of different climates and randomly expressed local processes interacting across a complex physical landscape.",,,Revista de Biología Tropical,,Universidad de Costa Rica,"0034-7744, 2215-2075",Altitude; Biodiversity; Biomass; Soil; Trees; Venezuela,2012-03,2012,2012-11-01,2012-03,60,1,11-33,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hernández, Lionel; Dezzeo, Nelda; Sanoja, Elio; Salazar, Leandro; Castellanos, Hernán","Hernández, Lionel (Universidad Nacional Experimental de Guayana); Dezzeo, Nelda (Centro de Ecología); Sanoja, Elio (Universidad Nacional Experimental de Guayana); Salazar, Leandro (Universidad Nacional Experimental de Guayana); Castellanos, Hernán (Universidad Nacional Experimental de Guayana)",,"Hernández, Lionel (); Dezzeo, Nelda (); Sanoja, Elio (); Salazar, Leandro (); Castellanos, Hernán ()",,,,,,,,,,,14,4,0.11,1.46,,https://revistas.ucr.ac.cr/index.php/rbt/article/download/2360/2313,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1067855427,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,

Extinction of the organ-pipe Montastraea occurred after more than 500,000 years of dominance in the shallow-water reef habitat of Barbados. Extinction resulted in a morphological shift of the columnar Montastraea lineage from thick to thin columns in modern reef environments. Pleistocene colonies of the columnar morphotype sympatric with organ-pipe Montastraea showed greater column widths than those in allopatry. We subjected our data to a number of criteria for interpreting the morphological shift as character release following lifting of competitive pressure after extinction. The morphological differences do not appear to be due either to chance or to physical properties of the marine environment. Differential local extinction and recolonization of four members of the species complex did not occur on Barbados, so that the species coexisted and appear to have coevolved between more than 600,000 and 82,000 years ago. The morphological shift is related to coral growth form and growth rate, and thus reflects the acquisition of a primary resource in corals--light. Character release occurred at the same oceanic Caribbean island (Barbados) where environments have fluctuated with similar variance throughout the period of coexistence. Not only has competition among living members of the Montastraea ""annularis"" species complex been convincingly demonstrated, but trends in relative abundance among fossil members of the species complex strongly suggest that a competitive hierarchy was operating during their Pleistocene coexistence on Barbados. We also observed an ecological analogue to character release on another Caribbean island. Curaçao. The distribution and abundance of living columnar M. annularis s.s. and massive M. faveolata from the leeward reef crest in Curaçao is greater now than in the Pleistocene, when organ-pipe Montastraea dominated this shallow-water reef habitat. Extinction of the faster growing, shallow-water organ-pipe Montastraea resulted in higher abundance of the columnar Montastraea lineage in shallow-water habitats, where it shifted its morphology to one adapted to high light levels. The species extinction released surviving lineages from a competitive network that had resulted in lower rank abundance in the Pleistocene community and enhanced abundance of both columnar M. annularis s.s. and M. faveolata in modern communities. Full validation of our interpretation of character release must await experiments that demonstrate whether phenotypic differences between populations have a genetic basis. However, we believe the results of this study point to the important, yet heretofore neglected, role that biological interactions have played in the evolution of closely related reef coral species.",,,Evolution,,Wiley,"0014-3820, 1558-5646","Animals; Anthozoa; Caribbean Region; Fishes; Fossils; Models, Biological; Models, Statistical; Phylogeny",2002-03,2002,2007-05-09,2002-03,56,3,479-501,Closed,Article,"Pandolfi, John M.; Lovelock, Catherine E.; Budd, Ann F.","Pandolfi, John M.

Similarities and differences in assemblage composition have been driven by large-scale events, such as the trans-Arctic interchange, which has shaped the species pool, and cycles of glaciation, which have determined phases of local or regional extinction and colonization. More recently, anthropogenically induced invasions and local extinctions have significantly altered biogeographic distributions. Here we consider for both hard and soft substrata how the presence or absence of key taxa influences the outcomes of trophic and other biological interactions, and evaluate the consequences for community structure and ecosystem functioning. On intertidal hard substratum shores, biodiversity of epilithic microphagous grazers differs across latitudinal and longitudinal scales. Diversity is high in southern Europe but declines to the north and across the Atlantic. Lower diversity and the absence of patellid limpets in Iceland and the northwest Atlantic compared to Europe result in differences in consumer pressure, and an apparent contrast in the importance of herbivory vs. competitive interactions and predation pressure as community structuring processes. Interestingly, despite differences in ""process,"" community patterns are remarkably similar between the east and west. On soft sediment shores, there are conspicuous geographic differences in importance of bioturbators and large digging predators. Hemichordates can be abundant and important infaunal bioturbators in the western Atlantic, but they generally play a much reduced role in the eastern Atlantic. In addition, the number and diversity of digging predators on western Atlantic shores is high; the horseshoe crab, swimming portunid crabs, large whelks, excavating waterfowl, and an abundance of skates and rays exert intense predation pressure and associated biogenic disturbance to sediments. In Europe, except for excavating waterfowl these taxa are rare or absent. Thus, the importance of large, biological agents of disturbance is lower on European shores as a consequence of both recent anthropogenic pressure and natural processes over larger time scales. Consideration of key structuring taxa over the Atlantic shows that human-mediated transport has had considerable influence. Faunas on both sides of the Atlantic are becoming more similar to the point that some of the key differences in assemblage composition and hence community organization have blurred. Recent introductions as well as planned experimental manipulations provide the opportunity to understand the role of species identity in determining community structure and ecosystem functioning over large spatial scales; the North Atlantic may be an ideal test system to explore these areas.","This work has arisen through the NSF funded CORONA network led by Cliff Cunningham.

Secreted mucins, produced by goblet cells and the gastric mucosa, provide the scaffold for a micrometers-thick mucus layer that lines the epithelia of the gut and respiratory tract(3,4). In addition to mucins, mucus layers also contain antimicrobial peptides, cytokines, and immunoglobulins(5-9). The mucus layer is an important part of host innate immunity, and forms the first line of defense against invading microorganisms(8,10-12). As such, the mucus is subject to numerous interactions with microbes, both pathogens and symbionts, and secreted mucins form an important interface for these interactions. The study of such biological interactions usually involves histological methods for tissue collection and staining. The two most commonly used histological methods for tissue collection and preservation in the clinic and in research laboratories are: formalin fixation followed by paraffin embedding, and tissue freezing, followed by embedding in cryo-protectant media. Paraffin-embedded tissue samples produce sections with optimal qualities for histological visualization including clarity and well-defined morphology. However, during the paraffin embedding process a number of epitopes become altered and in order to study these epitopes, tissue sections have to be further processed with one of many epitope retrieval methods(13). Secreted mucins and lipids are extracted from the tissue during the paraffin-embedding clearing step, which requires prolong incubation with organic solvents (xylene or Citrisolv). Therefore this approach is sub-optimal for studies focusing on the nature and distribution of mucins and mucus in vivo. In contrast, freezing tissues in Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) embedding medium avoids dehydration and clearing of the sample, and maintains the sample hydration. This allows for better preservation of the hydrated mucus layer, and thus permits the study of the numerous roles of mucins in epithelial biology. As this method requires minimal processing of the tissue, the tissue is preserved in a more natural state. Therefore frozen tissues sections do not require any additional processing prior to staining and can be readily analyzed using immunohistochemistry methods. We demonstrate the preservation of micrometers-thick secreted mucus layer in frozen colon samples. This layer is drastically reduced when the same tissues are embedded in paraffin. We also demonstrate immunofluorescence staining of glycan epitopes presented on mucins using plant lectins. The advantage of this approach is that it does not require the use of special fixatives and allows utilizing frozen tissues that may already be preserved in the laboratory.","The authors would like to thank Nicole M.

Built up in 1963 with the aim to produce hydroelectricity this reservoir is utilized for several activities such as fish production, irrigation, navigation, tourism and recreation, besides hydroelectricity production. The seasonal cycle of events in this reservoir is driven by the hydrological features of the basin with consequences on the retention time and on the limnological functions of this artificial ecosystem. The reservoir is polymitic with short periods of stability. Hydrology of the basin, retention time of the reservoir and cold fronts have an impact in the vertical and horizontal structure of the system promoting rapid changes in the planktonic community and in the succession of species. Blooms of Microcystis sp. are common during periods of stability. Superimposed to the climatological and hydrological forcing functions the human activities in the watershed produce considerable impact such as the discharge of untreated wastewater, the high suspended material contributions and fertilizers from the sugar cane plantations. The fish fauna of the reservoir has been changed extent due to the introduction of exotic fish species that exploit the pelagic zone of the reservoir. Changes in the primary productivity of phytoplankton in this reservoir, in the zooplankton community in the diversity and organization of trophic structure are a consequence of eutrophication and its increase during the last 20 years. Control of eutrophication by treating wastewater from urban sources, adequate agricultural practices in order to diminish the suspended particulate matter contribution, revegetation of the watershed and riparian forests along the tributaries are some possible restoration measures. Another action that can be effective is the protection of wetlands in the main tributaries as an effort to control eutrophication and particulate material load. Hydrology, climatic forcing and retention time are major forcing functions that promote the circulation (vertical and horizontal) in the reservoir and probably have a strong effect on dissolved and particulate material distribution. The 114 tributaries are systems that enhance spatial heterogeneity promoting diversity throughout ecological niches. Switches of control systems of this artificial ecosystem seems to be related with physical - physical forces; physical - biological forces during short periods of time, and biological - biological interactions at varying degrees during the seasonal cycle.",,,Brazilian Journal of Biology,,FapUNIFESP (SciELO),"1519-6984, 1678-4375","Animals; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biodiversity; Brazil; Climatic Processes; Cyanobacteria; Eutrophication; Fishes; Humans; Phytoplankton; Plankton; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Rivers; Seasons; Tropical Climate; Water Microbiology; Water Movements; Zooplankton",2008-11,2008,2009-01-21,2008-11,68,4 suppl,1079-1098,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tundisi, JG.; Matsumura-Tundisi, T.; Abe, DS.","Tundisi, JG.

The present study describes some of the interactions between ants and this bamboo species. The experiment was carried out in a fragment of a montane tropical forest in the Parque Estadual do Itacolomi, near Ouro Preto, MG, Brazil. Thirty culms of bamboo were randomly collected. The ants were obtained by direct collection from nodes and internodes. Morphometric variables of the bamboo were recorded for characterization of potential ant habitat. Merostachys fischeriana grows in rosettes as a thin bamboo (average = 1,0 cm; se = 0,27; n = 20) and is tall enough to reach the upper canopy of this low forest (average = 9,1 m; se = 2,72; n = 20). Fifteen ant species were sampled. Brachymyrmex heeri Forel was the most abundant in the nodes, while Camponotus crassus Mayr (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) was the most abundant in the internodes. The composition of the species that inhabit the internodes was different from the composition in the node (Q-test: Q = 3,76; P = 0,05). The level of occupation was defined by the number of holes (F = 10,33; P < 0,01), the number of internodes in the canopy (F = 6,84; P = 0,01) and the length of the culm (F = 7,52; P = 0,01).

The survival is believed to be strongly determined by biological interactions and sea conditions, however it has been poorly investigated. We examined the settlement patterns related to relevant biotic and abiotic factors (i.e. Density-dependence, wind stress, wave height and coastal current velocity) potentially determining post-settler survival rates of a coastal necto-benthic fish of wide distribution in the Mediterranean and eastern Atlantic, the white seabream (Diplodus sargus). An observational study of the demography of juveniles of this species was carried out at six coves in Menorca Island (Balearic Islands, western Mediterranean). Three of the coves were located in the northern and wind exposed coast, at the Northeast (NE) side; while the other three were found along the southern and sheltered coast, at the Southwest (SW) side of the island. The settlement period extended from early May to late June and maximum juvenile densities at the sampling sites varied between 5 and 11 ind. m-1 with maximum values observed in late May simultaneously occurring in the two coasts. Our analysis of juvenile survival, based on the interpretation of the observed patters using an individual based model (IBM), revealed two stages in the size-mortality relationships. An initial density-dependent stage was observed for juveniles up to 20 mm TL, followed by a density independent stage when other factors dominated the survival at sizes > 20 mm TL. No significant environmental effects were observed for the small size class (<20mm TL). Different significant environmental effects affecting NE and SW coves were observed for the medium (20-30mm TL) and large (>30mm TL) size class. In the NE, the wind stress consistently affected the density of fish of 20-30 mm and >30 mm TL with a dome-shape effect with higher densities at intermediate values of wind stress and negative effect at the extremes. The best models applied in the SW coves showed a significant non-linear negative effect on fish density that was also consistent for both groups 20-30 mm and >30 mm TL. Higher densities were observed at low values of wave height in the two groups. Because of these variations, the number of juveniles present at the end of the period was unrelated to their initial density and average survival varied among locations. In consequence, recruitment was (1) primarily limited by denso-dependient procedures at settlement stage, and (2) by sea conditions at post-settlement, where extreme wave conditions depleted juveniles. Accordingly, regional hydrodynamic conditions during the settlement season produced significant impacts on the juvenile densities depending on their size and with contrasted effects in respectto cove orientation. The similar strength in larval supply between coves, in addition to the similar mean phenology for settlers in the north and south of the Island, suggests that all fish may come from the same parental reproductive pool. These factors should be taken into account when assessing relationships between settlers, recruits and adults of white seabream.","ACu was funded by a PhD studentship from the Spanish Institute of Oceanography.

Eventhough some studies have covered various aspects of its natural history, no evaluations on the effects of human disturbance on its population dynamics have been made. This work compared the abundance, growth, and mortality of O. quadrata in two disturbed beaches (Aventuras and Majahual) and two preserved beaches (Xcacel and Puerto Angel) from the Mexican Caribbean. For this, nine samplings were made on each beach (every two to three months) between March 2013 and November 2014. Crabs were collected manually by three people, during the night first hours and for one hour, and a total area of 9 000 m2 per beach. The crabs were measured, weighed, and separated into three groups: juvenile, male and female; while abundance was estimated by the number of collected crabs, and growth parameters were estimated using length frequencies. A total of 1 047 crabs were sampled in the four beaches; a higher crab abundance was found in the preserved beaches, but significant differences were only found between Puerto Angel and Majahual (Tukey, p<0.05). The adult-juvenile ratio was 1:1 in Xcacel and Aventuras, while in Majahual, more juveniles than adults were collected; and Puerto Angel had more adults than the juveniles. The size structure at Xcacel ranged from 4-32 mm, but in the rest of the beaches the minimum size was 5 mm. The maximum size at Aventuras, Majahual and Puerto Angel were 27 mm, 25 mm and 30 mm, respectively. The modal progression analysis of length’s pooled data, revealed the presence of at least two groups of ages in all beaches. For all beaches, individuals smaller than 10 mm length were collected in almost all sampling months, indicating a continuous recruitment throughout the year. The length-weight relationship of the ghost crab was found isometric in the two preserved beaches, and negative allometric at the two impacted beaches. Crabs from Puerto Angel showed the highest body condition (Tukey, p<0.05). K-values ranged from 0.6-0.97/year and L∞ from 29.0 mm to 33.6 mm with higher values for the two preserved beaches. The highest mortality values were found in Xcacel and Aventuras. In the disturbed beaches, the destruction of the dunes, the mechanical cleaning and the removal of organic matter, seem to be the main causes that lead to a low abundance of crabs, their slower growth and higher mortalities. However, in the best preserved beaches, biological interactions appear to be the most important aspects in regulating the population dynamics of this species. These results supported the information that the ghost crab is a good indicator of human disturbance, and its population changes were clearly measurable and comparable among protected and impacted beaches; these results are also relevant for the management of sandy beaches in the Mexican Caribbean.",,,Revista de Biología Tropical,,Universidad de Costa Rica,"0034-7744, 2215-2075",Analysis of Variance; Animals; Bathing Beaches; Brachyura; Caribbean Region; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environment; Female; Human Activities; Humans; Male; Mexico; Population Dynamics; Sex Distribution,2016-07-20,2016,2016-07-20,2016-12,64,4,1625-1641,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ocaña, Frank Alberto; De Jesús Navarrete, Alberto; De Jesús Carrillo, Rosa María; Rivera, José Juan Oliva","Ocaña, Frank Alberto (El Colegio de la Frontera Sur); De Jesús Navarrete, Alberto (El Colegio de la Frontera Sur); De Jesús Carrillo, Rosa María (El Colegio de la Frontera Sur); Rivera, José Juan Oliva (El Colegio de la Frontera Sur)",,"Ocaña, Frank Alberto (El Colegio de la Frontera Sur); De Jesús Navarrete, Alberto (El Colegio de la Frontera Sur); De Jesús Carrillo, Rosa María (El Colegio de la Frontera Sur); Rivera, José Juan Oliva (El Colegio de la Frontera Sur)",El Colegio de la Frontera Sur,grid.466631.0,Campeche,,Mexico,,,,,,10,6,,1.54,,https://revistas.ucr.ac.cr/index.php/rbt/article/download/19909/26627,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1067856202,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 41 Environmental Sciences,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,

Key determinants of carnivore distribution in dry environments are competition and the availability of water. Here, we gathered and mapped the available information on carnivore habitat quality in the high Andes and Puna in the extreme north of Argentina. We investigated four carnivore species: the Andean cat (Leopardus jacobita), the Pampas cat (Leopardus colocolo), the cougar (Puma concolor) and the culpeo fox (Lycalopex culpaeus). We assessed the main determinants of their distribution, testing explicitly for the effects of seasonal and temporal wetlands and biological interactions. We used species distribution models, and created biophysical models using environmental and landscape variables. Then, by including the four species' biophysical models into the model of the focal species, we tested for the importance of biological interactions. Wetlands were most important for the culpeo fox, most likely because it uses aquatic birds as prey. The cougar was the least restricted species in this arid environment, perhaps due to its large home range. In general, environmental variables, distances to wetlands and the annual range of temperature defined species’ distributions better than did biological interactions. Only the distribution of the Andean cat, a specialized species, was influenced by biological interactions with the Pampas cat.",We thank R.

We presented evidence of competitive and facilitative plant–plant conspecific and heterospecific interactions, and plant–soil–microbes interactions in relation to the abiotic environment at the fine patch-scale. We also showed evidence of animal–animal interactions and plant–animal interactions at the community scale through study cases involving both native and introduced herbivores. Moreover, we identified bottom-up and top-down forces governing the interactions between granivores (birds, ants, and small mammals) and seed availability/production at the community scale. At the landscape scale, we discussed feedbacks between domestic grazers and the spatial patterns of resources and their interrelationships with processes occurring at other scales. We concluded that research has steadily increased during the last 6 years but knowledge on biological interactions in the Monte desert is still scarce, particularly at a landscape scale.","Studies included in this review were partially funded by PICT 08-6027, PICT 08-11131, PICT 08-20454 (southern Monte) and PICT 01-03187, PICT 01-12199 (central Monte) of the National Agency for Scientific and Technological Promotion (ANPCyT), and PIP 4270, PIP 6496 (southern Monte) and PIP 6328 (central Monte) of the National Council for Scientific Research (CONICET) of Argentina.",,Journal of Arid Environments,,Elsevier,"0140-1963, 1095-922X",,2009-02,2009,,2009-02,73,2,212-221,Closed,Article,"Bertiller, M.B.; Marone, L.; Baldi, R.; Ares, J.O.","Bertiller, M.B.

1033,pub.1121968355,10.1111/jav.02223,,,,The spatial analysis of biological interactions: morphological variation responding to the co‐occurrence of competitors and resources,"By sharing geographic space, species are forced to interact with one another and the contribution of this process to evolutionary and ecological patterns of individual species is not fully understood. At the same time, species turnover makes that species composition varies from one area to another, so the analysis of biological interaction cannot be uncoupled from the spatial context. This is particularly important for clades that show high degree of specialization such as hummingbirds, where any variation in biotic pressures might lead to changes in morphology. Here, we describe the influence of biological interactions on the morphology of Hylocharis leucotis by simultaneously considering potential competition and diet resources. We characterized the extent of local potential competition and local available floral resources by correlating two measurements of hummingbird diversity, floral resources and the size of morphological space of H. leucotis along its geographic distribution. We found that H. leucotis shows an important morphological variability across its range and two groups can be recognized. Surprisingly, morphological variation is not always linked to local hummingbird richness or the phylogenetic similarity of. Only in the southern part of its distribution, H. leucotis is morphologically more variable in those communities where it coexist with closely related hummingbird species. We also found that morphological variation in H. leucotis is independent from the availability of floral resources. Our results suggest that abiotic factors might be responsible for morphological differences across populations in Hylocharis leucotis being biological interactions of minor importance.",,,Journal of Avian Biology,,Wiley,"0908-8857, 1600-048X",,2019-12-26,2019,2019-12-26,2019-12,50,12,,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Tovilla‐Sierra, Rosa Daniela; Herrera‐Alsina, Leonel; Bribiesca, Rafael; Arita, Héctor T.","Tovilla‐Sierra, Rosa Daniela (Inst. de Investigaciones en Ecosistemas y Sustentabilidad, Univ.

1032,pub.1034511083,10.1007/bf02414772,,,,Methods for ecological monitoring: Biological interactions in a rocky subtidal community,"Whilst both abiotic and biotic factors affect communities, biological interactions are widely believed to be the most important factors structuring subtidal communities. Among the potential biological interactions a few “key ” species may regulate species fluctuations. A rocky subtidal community in the Oslofjord (Norway) has been investigated using stereophotography, field experiments and manipulations (settlement plates, scraping, cages). The purpose was to develop a method for biological monitoring of chronic pollution effects. Around 60 species were identified in the community. The most permanent occupants wereLithothamnion sp. (25–30% cover) andPomatoceros triqueter (ca. 20% cover). The most important fluctuation was induced by the rapid growth of the hydroidLaomedea longissima to a 100% cover in June and its rapid disappearance. Free space covered more than 30% except in the period with large hydroid occurrence. The most active settlement period was in summer and autumn. The most important predators observed wereCoryphella sp.,Asterias rubens andPasmmechinus miliaris.Coryphella grazed upon the hydroids andAsterias andPsammechinus foraged on settled organisms which resulted in an increase of free space. Predation and recruitment in that order are probably the two most important factors structuring the studied community. The “key ” species were therefore the three predators. A monitoring programme should concentrate on these predators and their influence on the success of recruitment and the abundance of hydroids and free space, since these species control the natural fluctuations in the studied community. The stereophotographic method combined with simple settlement-plate experiments seems suitable for such a monitoring programme.",,,Helgoland Marine Research,,Springer Nature,"1438-387X, 1438-3888, 0174-3597",,1980-03,1980,,1980-03,33,1-4,473-483,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Christie, H.","Christie, H.

1017,pub.1020035954,10.2307/1942257,,,,Community Structure: A Neutral Model Analysis,"The relation of community structure to community function is the subject of much ecological theorizing. Three approaches to the problem, based on cybernetics, control theory, and niche theory, can be identified. They concur in giving biological interactions a major role in the determination of community structure in general, and species diversity in particular. To examine this body of theory, I use a ""neutral"" model for community development, a model which eliminates completely the biological interactions in question. Comparison of the patterns of community structure resulting from this model with the structure of natural communities provides an estimate of the effect of the biotic interactions. This can then be compared to the theoretically predicted effects. The neutral model used was originally developed in population genetics. In the context in which it is used here, it describes the stochastic development of a set of noninteracting populations, which colonize a community, persist temporarily, and eventually become extinct. The model predicts the form of the distribution of relative abundances and of species area curves, and sample values of species diversity. Comparisons of the model's predictions with actual community structure are made across what are taken to be gradients in the importance of biological interaction (successional vs. climax communities, high variation vs. low variation environments, the temperate zone vs. the tropics), using data on birds, fish, trees and insects. The results clearly contradict some of the theories of community structure. In those situations where biological interactions are predicted to generate the greatest increase in species diversity, the neutral model analysis shows that diversity is in fact significantly lower than would be expected in the absence of such interactions. Some implications of these findings for community theory are discussed.",,,Ecological Monographs,,Wiley,"0012-9615, 1557-7015",,1976-06,1976,,1976-06,46,3,327-354,Closed,Article,"Caswell, Hal","Caswell, Hal ()",,"Caswell, Hal ()",,,,,,,,,,,385,33,,,9,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1020035954,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,A05 Biological Sciences,
1014,pub.1070955967,10.2989/025776187784522144,,,,Biological interactions: causes or effects of variability in the Benguela ecosystem?,"The open-sea pelagic ecosystem is often thought of as a homogeneous environment allowing little room for biological accommodation between species — hence Hutchinson's ""paradox of the plankton"". By contrast, intertidal rocky shores are regarded as areas of high variability, both spatially and temporally, in which physical fluctuations result in biological patchiness and make it difficult to detect changes in community structure caused by biological interactions. The aim of this overview is to show that, in upwelled systems, particularly the Benguela, the pelagic ecosystem is far from homogeneous and that physical variation dominates many of the biological processes. Under these conditions, biotic interactions seldom determine the abundance or presence of particular species. To illustrate this fact, examples are drawn from the interaction between phytoplankton and zooplankton and between fish species. Nearshore and intertidal rocky coasts present an entirely different picture, in which (despite temporal and topographic variability) tightly knit biotic interactions may radically modify community structure. As one example, the role of birds (as predators and guano producers) is discussed. Another case, the relationship between rock lobsters, mussels and whelks, illustrates the principle that alternative stable states can be reached, depending entirely upon biological interactions.",,,South African Journal of Marine Science,,National Inquiry Services Center (NISC),0257-7615,,1987-06-01,1987,2010-04-08,1987-06-01,5,1,425-445,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Branch, G.

988,pub.1022758654,10.1016/j.hal.2015.06.004,,,,"A hierarchy of conceptual models of red-tide generation: Nutrition, behavior, and biological interactions","Red tides – discolorations of the sea surface due to dense plankton blooms – occur regularly in coastal and offshore waters along much of the world's coastline. Red tides often cause large-scale mortalities of fish and shellfish and significant losses to the aquaculture and tourist industries of many countries. Therefore, understanding and predicting the mechanisms controlling the outbreak, persistence, spread, and decline of red tides are important concerns to scientists, officials, industry, and the public. With increasing knowledge of red-tide species and red-tide events, new mechanisms have been discovered. Based on the nutrition and behaviors of red-tide organisms and biological interactions among them, red-tide outbreaks can be categorized into a hierarchy of four generation mechanisms (GM1–GM4). In the simplest, GM1, all phototrophic red-tide species were treated as exclusively autotrophic organisms without the ability to swim. However, this GM cannot explain red-tide outbreaks in oligotrophic surface waters offshore. Vertical migration (considered in GM2) and mixotrophy (GM3) enable red-tide flagellates to acquire growth factors from nutrient-rich deep waters or co-occurring prey, respectively. In natural environments, all red tides occur by those species outgrowing co-occurring organisms; red-tide species dominate communities by eliminating other species or reducing their abundances. Thus, GM4 contains the direct biological interactions (i.e., inhibition by physical contact or chemical effects) and indirect biological interactions (i.e., acquiring resources faster than others) that can affect the dominance of red-tide species under given conditions. Correctly choosing one of these four GMs for red tides dominated by one causative species is important because the accuracy of predictions may be outweighed by the costs and time required to acquire the relevant information.

A model which eliminates biological interactions as a determinant of diversity can be used to assess the potential impact of physical and geographic factors operating alone on temporal trends in diversity (succession) and on spatial differences along latitudinal or environmental gradients. If a biologically neutral model can generate diversity patterns similar to those we observe, it can be argued that traditional hypotheses which depend on biological interactions are not the most parsimonious explanations for diversity patterns. If the neutral model approach supports a spectrum of possible hypotheses, perhaps the entire concept of species diversity can be discarded as a useful measure of community structure.
                  An earlier analysis of this type supported the notion that diversity patterns can be adequately explained by physical disturbance, global geography gradients, and stochastic immigration and extinction events. Our neutral model analysis does not affirm this view. We argue that the coarse level at which simple colonization models operate does not permit strong conclusions regarding the underlying mechanisms. Detailed community analyses may provide the best evidence for the nature of structuring processes. Based on the evidence available in the literature, species diversity is likely to be generated by a small number of biological processes interacting with physical-geographic gradients.",,,Paleobiology,,Cambridge University Press (CUP),"0094-8373, 1938-5331",,1982,1982,2016-02-08,1982,8,1,45-55,Closed,Article,"Thomas, William R.; Foin, Theodore C.","Thomas, William R.

Global stability corresponds to the idea of successional changes leading to climax communities. Yet, neighbourhood stability is shown to be a more realistic model for changes in dominance of marine benthic sediment-living communities. The factors inducing state changes in dominance pattern were shown to be principally biological interactions. In order to model the stability of benthic ecosystems, much more attention must be given to natural history-type studies of biological interactions. Furthermore, mathematical models usually assume that the systems are globally stable. Should neighbourhood stability prove to be the rule for benthic systems then realistic models of such systems will be an order of magnitude more complex.",,,Helgoland Marine Research,,Springer Nature,"1438-387X, 1438-3888, 0017-9957",,1977-08,1977,,1977-08,30,1-4,427-444,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Gray, J.

A multi-scale approach was used to quantify spatial-complexity at five different scales of resolution in three different aquatic plants species (Cabomba furcata, Najas microcarpa, and Utricularia foliosa) collected from lagoons in the Upper Paraná River floodplain basin, Brazil. The effect of scale upon spatial-complexity was highly significant and interactions between species and scale were also significant, suggesting that habitat heterogeneity was scale dependent and plants contained a species-specific threshold where complexity was highest.

It has been questioned whether all these levels are actually real, although it now seems accepted by most scientific investigators that more than one level is actually targeted by selection. Intriguingly, despite the importance of biological interaction is relevant to the course of evolution (and to the level to which selection applies) the obvious locus for biological interaction, the community, has received little evolutionary attention by mammal paleontologists. Herein, we investigate the concept of a biochron, which is the approximation closest to a real community in the paleontological world, and its applications. Then, we offer some clues as to how to use biochrons for investigating community evolution, and explain why paleontological community evolution is a partly novel, highly promising field of research within the realm of paleobiology.","We are grateful to Jussi Eronen, Jukka Jernvall, Anu Kaakinen, Pirkko Ukkonen, Suvi Viranta for inviting us to contribute to this volume.

A series of observations revealed that intertidal forms have the ability to retain water in the coelenteron during exposure to air,/while the infralittoral form cannot do so. This different behaviour is attributed to morphological characteristics, such as the specific body shape and the structure of the sphincter and retractor muscles.

The Role of Habitat Heterogeneity in Biological Interactions,"The fundamental regularities of trophology, such as the dependence of the fish diet on the food concentration, foraging selectivity, and competition for food, which are the key concepts in V.S. Ivlev’s book Experimental Ecology of the Fish Feeding are quite familiar to a broad community of ecologists. However, the range of problems addressed in this milestone study is not limited to the issues of fish trophology. The effect of habitat heterogeneity on biological interactions in ecosystems, which is one of the major objects of research in contemporary ecology, is discussed in the book in two aspects: the connection between the foraging intensity and selectivity to the heterogeneity of prey distribution (the degree of aggregation per Ivlev) and the role of physical obstacles in the regulation of intra- and interspecific competition for food. The dependence of the feeding rate on aggregation was even more substantial than the dependence on prey concentration. Ivlev demonstrated this in laboratory experiments and, which is even more important and difficult, studies of natural water bodies. In this paper, a brief analysis of the ideas and results included in the book and related to the ecological significance of habitat heterogeneity is followed by an overview of a number of modern studies that adhere to Ivlev’s working style and develop his approaches and ideas. It is apparent from these studies that habitat heterogeneity, which is determined by different factors and manifested on different scales, affects both the behavior and the population dynamics of the interacting organisms. As a result, both the mechanisms underlying biological interactions and the structure and functioning of organism communities are modified.",,,Biology Bulletin Reviews,,Pleiades Publishing,"2079-0864, 2079-0872",,2020-01,2020,2020-03-10,2020-01,10,1,11-18,Closed,Article,"Mikheev, V.

                    Pfeiffer, though each species is found alone at several localities. The species are less alike morphologically where they occur together than where they are allopatric. This allopatric convergence and sympatric divergence strongly suggests the biological interaction known as character displacement, often documented for living populations. The relatively complete fossil record of Bermuda offers advantages for studying this phenomenon. Collections can be made from a variety of microhabitats occupied through time. Statistical analysis of 1,600 individuals collected from more than 100 localities indicates that interspecific variation is primarily a function of the presence or absence of a congener and depends to a lesser degree on microhabitat.

We performed a series of experiments to determine the migratory response of bay scallops, Argopecten irradians concentricus Say, to changes in intraspecific density under two different, tidally oscillating flow regimes in the field: 0–0.10 m s−1 and 0–0.28 m s−1. Despite the bay scallop's ability to swim actively and achieve unaided bursts of motion covering distances on the scale of 0.5 m, the expression of density‐dependent emigration was dependent on the presence of higher flows. In the low‐flow regime, there was negligible emigration during 24 h at any density level (12, 25, or 62 m−2); however, emigration rate increased with density (0% at 12 m−2, 60% at 25 m−2, and 71% at 62 m−2) under the higher flow regime.

To envision long-term changes of lake trophic status in several shallow lakes from the Yangtze River basin, we focused on variations in nutrient level and attempted to use both hydrologic- and ecodynamic-based physical models. One was an equivalent-hydrology model with external driving forces from catchment climate and hydrology changes (Model 1), the other was a dynamic model with internal driving forces from the biological interactions within the lake ecosystem (Model 2). Two models were employed in order to distinguish the effects of climate change (by Model 1) from ecosystem feedbacks (by Model 2) on the long-term lake nutrients changes and to further determine which driver was the primary cause for the changes. Variations in lake producer biomass and total phosphorus (TP) were simulated for a historic 200-yr period (1640–1840 AD) in Lake Taihu and seven other similar lakes from the Yangtze River basin after calibration and validation of the control runs (1950–2000 AD). Results showed that (1) TP simulations by Model 1 and Model 2 were mostly consistent with the reconstructed nutrient records from lake sediment cores; (2) the long-term variations of lake nutrients were primarily affected by precipitation under the influence of climate change and the decreases in lake nutrients were more likely to respond to the dry climate; and (3) approximately 49% of the variability in nutrient concentrations were contributed by the feedback of biological interactions in the lake ecosystem.

890,pub.1125979462,10.1111/fwb.13502,,,,Seasonal habitat use indicates that depth may mediate the potential for invasive round goby impacts in inland lakes,"The round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) is among the fastest‐spreading introduced aquatic species in North America and is radiating inland from the Great Lakes into freshwater ecosystems across the landscape. Predicting and managing the impacts of round gobies requires information on the factors influencing their distribution in habitats along the invasion front, yet this information is not available for many recently invaded ecosystems. We evaluated the seasonal habitat use and biomass of round gobies in an inland temperate lake to define the spatiotemporal scope of biological interactions at the leading edge of the round goby invasion. Using novel statistical approaches, we combined hierarchical models that control for imperfect species detection with flexible smooth terms to describe non‐linear relationships between round goby abundance and environmental gradients. Subsequently, we generated accurate detection‐corrected estimates of the standing stock biomass of round gobies. Our results show seasonally differentiated habitat niches, where suitable round goby habitat in summer months is restricted to shallow depths (<18.4 m) with a mixture of vegetative and mussel cover. We found high round goby biomass of 122 kg/ha in occupied habitats during the summer, with a total lake‐wide biomass of 766,000 kg. In winter, round gobies migrate to deep offshore habitats and disperse, dramatically altering their scope for biological interactions with resident aquatic species across summer and winter seasons. The results of this study indicate that the scope of biological interactions in inland lakes may be seasonally variable, with potential for high round goby biomass in shallow lakes or at the periphery of deep lakes in the summer months. Such shallow‐water habitats may therefore present higher risk of ecological impacts from round gobies in invaded lentic ecosystems. As round gobies expand inland, consideration of seasonal habitat use will be an important factor in predicting the impacts of this pervasive invader.","We thank A. Ullman, J.P. Hellenbrand, A.

Experimental sporophytes transplanted to 2 and 5 m depth showed the typical annual growth pattern of Laminaria species. Surprisingly, 2 m plants died after the first resting phase, whereas 5 m plants survived and showed outgrowth of a new blade generation. Thalli at both depths were infected with the brown algal endophyte Streblonema aecidioides, with host deformations being significantly stronger in 2 m plants. Growth rates of infected sporophytes were reduced. Exclusion of UV light in 2 m depth resulted in less infected thalli. Discs excised from L. saccharina and cultivated in different photon fluence rates from 10–600 µmol m−2 s−1 did not differ in growth rate, photosynthesis or dark respiration. Hence, an exclusion of L. saccharina from shallow depths caused by high light cannot be concluded.

To understand how the semiaquatic bug communities are shaped, it was first verified whether there was a pattern of co‐occurrence between species. It was subsequently tested whether the pattern found was related to environmental variables. Lastly, it was verified whether morphological divergence between species was present in the morphological and functional traits selected. 2. A pattern of species co‐occurrence was found in the studied assemblage, related to both environmental variables and interspecific biological interactions. Pairs of species with negative, positive, and random co‐occurrence were found. Traits related to predation competition, sexual competition, and interaction with the environment showed significant morphological divergence. 3. Therefore, more than one process defines species co‐occurrence patterns in semiaquatic bug communities. It is suggested that environmental influence is related to species microhabitat preference. On the other hand, the morphological divergence found is related to competition and sharing of food resources. A species co‐occurrence pattern was found in the studied assemblage related to environmental variables and interspecific biological interactions. Four species pairs exhibited aggregate co‐occurrence (positive) and five pairs exhibited segregated co‐occurrence (negative). Traits related to predation competition, sexual competition, and interaction with the environment showed significant morphological divergence.","We extend our thanks to the Biodiversity Research Program of Eastern Amazonia (PPBIO) and the Fundação Amazônia de amparo a Estudos e Pesquisas (Research Foundation of the State of Pará FAPESPA) through the FAPESPA project: ICAAF 03/2011, for support.

However, the difference between the two types of heterogeneities have not been studied, except for Clark and Yoshimura (1993). We evaluated experimentally the effect of temporal and spatial heterogeneities on the persistence of a biological community. The experimental communities consisted of one parasitic wasp species, one bean weevil species, and two kinds of bean. Temporal and spatial heterogeneities of experimental communities were generated by kinds and timing of bean supply. Of all the experimental communities, the most persistent community was a temporally and spatially homogeneous community with Red Kidney bean as primary resource. Compared to spatially heterogeneous communities, temporally heterogeneous communities were more persistent. These results were easily explained by considering the attack rate of parasitic wasps and the difference between arithmetic and geometric means. In order to discuss the relative importance of environmental heterogeneity and the mode of biological interaction on community persistence, we have to measure the degree of environmental heterogeneity as the rate of change of the strength of interspecific interactions.",,,Population Ecology,,Wiley,"1438-3896, 1438-390X, 0034-5466, 1437-5613",,1997-12,1997,2018-11-29,1997-12,39,2,249-260,Closed,Article,"Mitsunaga, Takayuki; Fujii, Koichi","Mitsunaga, Takayuki (Graduate School of Biological Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, 305, Ibaraki, Japan); Fujii, Koichi (Graduate School of Biological Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, 305, Ibaraki, Japan; Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, 305, Ibaraki, Japan)","Mitsunaga, Takayuki (University of Tsukuba)","Mitsunaga, Takayuki (University of Tsukuba); Fujii, Koichi (University of Tsukuba; University of Tsukuba)",University of Tsukuba,grid.20515.33,Tsukuba,Ibaraki,Japan,,,,,,4,2,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1030449555,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3104 Evolutionary Biology,,,,,,A05 Biological Sciences,

Some of the earliest manipulative experimental ecological studies were undertaken on rocky shores. Many, over time, have made considerable contributions to ecological theory, especially highlighting the importance of biological interactions at the community level. The suitability of rocky shores as convenient test systems for ecological experimentation is outlined. Here we consider contributions from rocky shores to the emerging concepts of supply-side ecology, the roles of competition, predation and grazing, disturbance and succession and positive interactions in structuring communities along environmental gradients. We then address alternative stable states, relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and bottom-up and top-down control of ecosystems. We briefly consider the feedback and synergies between ecological concepts and experimental work on rocky shores, whilst still emphasizing the traditional values of marine natural history upheld in JMBA since its first publication. The importance of rigorous experimental designs championed by Underwood and co-workers is emphasized. Recent progress taking advantage of new technologies and emerging approaches is considered. We illustrate how experimental studies have shown the importance of biological interactions in modulating species and assemblage-level responses to climate change and informed conservation and management of coastal ecosystems.","SJH, LBC, SRJ, KH wish to thank the European-funded project EUROROCK which enabled us to all work together in such a fruitful and fun way, and was an important step in all our careers.

However, how benthic composition mediates reef fishes' biotic interactions at isolated environments such as oceanic islands remains largely unknown. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of four different reef microhabitats over biological interactions of fishes in an understudied oceanic island, Príncipe Island. For that, we recorded a total of 46 Underwater Remote Videos (RUVs) to document benthic composition and fishes' trophic and agonistic interactions. We used benthic cover estimates to group the samples into four microhabitats (dominated by epilithic algal matrix [EAM], sand/rock, corals and sponges), then quantified fishes' trophic and agonistic interactions in each microhabitat. All microhabitats presented a different structure of trophic and agonistic interactions of the fish assemblage. Feeding pressure (FP) and agonistic interactions were higher on the EAM microhabitat and lower in coral microhabitat. Herbivores were the main responsible group for the FP in all microhabitats. Territorial damselfishes used microhabitats differently for both trophic and agonistic interactions. We demonstrated that reef fish diversity and intensity of biotic interactions varied according the spatial distribution of benthic resources, which suggests that benthic composition plays an important role on structuring biological interactions at isolated reef systems.","We thank all members of the Príncipe Expedition at São Tomé and Príncipe 2016, especially Luiz A.

Conceivably this could lead to community structure being organized in a different way to that in macrofauna. Commonly, community structure has been measured as a mathematical description of the relationship of individuals to species or as a simple diversity index.Individuals and species of meiofauna from kelp holdfast along the north-east coast of England fitted both a logarithmic series and a log-normal model using data from unpolluted sites. At a polluted site the fit was generally less good to both models. In general however, the log-normal was a closer fit to the observed data than the log-series, as has been found in other marine data.Using a neutral model, which eliminates the influence of biological interactions, diversity was found to be higher than predicted in meiofauna from kelp holdfasts and in Gastrotricha from sand beaches in eastern U.S.A. At a polluted site and with data for nematodes from an unpolluted site, diversity was not significantly different from neutral model predictions, but eveness was significantly lower.Unlike terrestrial ecosystems therefore, biological interactions lead to higher diversity values in marine meiofaunal communities than neutral model predictions. Pollution has the effect of increasing dominance and thus lowering diversity values to neutral model predictions.",,,Sarsia,,Taylor & Francis,"0036-4827, 1503-1128",,1978-11-30,1978,2011-12-21,1978-11-30,63,4,265-272,Closed,Article,"Gray, John S.","Gray, John S.

Trichiurus lepturus was more abundant at bottom water temperatures of over 16 °C and in the 40–120 m depth range. From late spring to fall, juveniles of 5–30 cm total length (TL) were found in coastal waters, subadults (TL 30–70 cm) mainly in inner shelf waters and adults (TL > 70 cm) in coastal, inner and outer shelf waters. Higher catches of subadults and adults were found associated with thermal fronts in the western boundary of the Subtropical Convergence or with a shelf break upwelling observed in summer. The standing stock in a 58 000 km2 shelf area estimated by the swept area method, ranged from 3066 t (±46% CI) in September 1981 to 37814 t (±22% CI) in January 1982.

However, there are reports of character convergence in areas of overlap. Here we present a case study of sympatric convergence and allopatric divergence in form between two species, Barnea Candida (Linnaeus, 1758), and Pholas orientalis Gmelin, 1791. They are members of closely related genera of marine bivalves from the eastern coast of India. So far as we know, this is the first report of a biological interaction between marine living bivalves. These two species are mud-boring deposit feeders. All of the characters here analyzed to show character shifting have adaptive significance or are proxy data for trophic apparatus. The present study involves more than 1,200 specimens collected from three sympatric and three allopatric sites that range over 1,000 km. Statistical analyses reveal that B.candida diverges more from its allopatric position than P. orientalis in sympatry. Character displacement generally takes place in sympatry to avoid or minimize competition for similar resources. The present two species have similar reproductive and feeding strategies. They also have similar ecological requirements for food and habitat. Because of these ecological and functional constraints, Barnea Candida and Pholas orientalis could not reduce competition by resource partitioning. Instead, they compete and hence converge.","We acknowledge the help and cooperation provided by the ONGC officials in the field. P. Roy, S. Mondai (Jadavpur University), and S.

Some zooplankton categories showed evidence of diurnal vertical migration, while others had long-period temporal changes in mean abundance. Variance-to-mean ratio for large copepods and euphausiids was higher at night than during the day, while the opposite was true for chaetognaths and pteropods. Within a given category, the variance-to-mean ratio generally increased with a category's abundance. Spatial abundance variations were characterized by trends (i.e., fluctuations larger than length of the net hauls) in some taxonomic categories. No consistent differences in scales of variability were found as a function of animal size or from day to night. Correlation analysis of taxonomic counts implied that significant biological interactions occurred. The proportions of counts of taxonomic groups showed no large changes over the time-space scales sampled. However, the proportions of biomass in taxonomic groups differed from day to night due to the large variability of euphausiids.

Especially in forested streams, such linkage with allochthonous POM is fundamental for saprophytic chain of stream ecosystems. Here, we reviewed current understanding of riverine POM by focusing its classification, dynamics, and ecological role in streams. Generally, coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM, >1mm) is broken down to fine particulate organic matter (FPOM, 0.45 μm-1mm) and dissolved organic matter (DOM, <0.45 μm) while providing essential energy and nutrients for microbes and aquatic fauna. Since input and transport of POM depend highly on season and discharge fluctuation, POM concentration in temperate streams shows wide ranges: 0.001 to 3mgC L-1 for CPOM and 0.05 to 1mgC L-1 for FPOM. For deposited POM density, channel unit such as riffle and pool is also influential. Major ecological roles of riverine POM are 1) habitat for aquatic fauna, 2) energy and nutrient supply for microbes, 3) energy and nutrient supply for aquatic fauna, and 4) material transport to downstream reaches and ocean. Colonization of fungi and bacteria on POM mediates carbon and nutrient uptake of aquatic fauna, especially macroinvertebrates. In stream ecosystems, therefore, POM is a major driving force and repeatedly experiences biological interaction and transformation, which is referred as organic matter spiraling. Thus, understanding of organic matter dynamics and its biological interaction is essential for conservation and restoration of stream ecosystems.",,,Ecology and Civil Engineering,,Ecology and Civil Engineering Society,"1882-5974, 1344-3755",,2006,2006,,2006,9,1,85,All OA; Bronze,Article,"YOSHIMURA, Chihiro; TANIDA, Kazumi; FURUMAI, Hiroaki; NAKAJIMA, Fumiyuki","YOSHIMURA, Chihiro (); TANIDA, Kazumi (); FURUMAI, Hiroaki (); NAKAJIMA, Fumiyuki ()",,"YOSHIMURA, Chihiro (); TANIDA, Kazumi (); FURUMAI, Hiroaki (); NAKAJIMA, Fumiyuki ()",,,,,,,,,,,6,1,,0.4,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ece/9/1/9_1_85/_pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1009578538,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3107 Microbiology; 37 Earth Sciences,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

We analyzed count data by means of a multi-species N-mixture model with symmetric interactions. Interactions within pair of species were estimated from the residual correlation of their realized abundances, after accounting for four landscape features: landscape heterogeneity calculated from land cover data, edge density of woody vegetation patches, tree cover density, net primary productivity.ResultsMost species displayed very low detection probability (p ~ 0.10). All species responded with different intensity and sensitivity to landscape predictors. Two biological interactions resulted significant: L. bilineata and P. siculus showed a positive interaction, while P. muralis and C. chalcides displayed a negative interaction.ConclusionsUsing community N-mixture models we demonstrated that, also with observational data obtained from a realized community, partitioning the filtering process of the landscape from the one of biotic interactions is possible.",We are grateful to Dino Biancolini and Domenico Cascianelli for their support during field activity.

During the period of submersion, smaller deposit feeders were dominant at the subsurface, whereas large nematodes (originally classified as predators) were concentrated at the surface. The interstitial water content showed a weak correlation to the observed patterns and biological interactions among nematodes, such as predation and competition, which were measured through stable isotopes, also explained the observed segregation. The predator Enoplolaimus litoralis and its potential prey species did not co-exist in the same part of the sediment, suggesting avoidance of predation by prey species. In addition, the different prey species inhabited different subsurface layers, which can be explained by avoidance of competition for food. Stable isotope signatures further showed that the two major biological components of sandy beaches (macrofauna and meiofauna, including some species assumed to be predators) partly depend on microphytobenthos, demonstrating the importance of in situ primary producers in the diet of the fauna from ultra-dissipative sandy beaches. However, meiofauna and macrofauna do not seem to compete for these food sources. The combined examination of environmental and biological factors revealed the additional importance of the latter in controlling the vertical distribution of nematodes in environments that were previously assumed to be mainly physically controlled.","We thank Tania Nara, Niels Viaene and Bart Beuselinck for their support during the sampling campaigns, as well as Annick Van Kenhove and Guy de Smet for their help during the meiofauna picking.

The extraradical hyphae-associated microbiome of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), the “hyphosphere microbiome,” harbors a diverse reservoir of microbes. The biological interactions in the AMF hyphosphere have major implications for soil carbon and nutrient cycling, soil food web dynamics, and plant nutrition and health. Hyphosphere microbial communities are thought to assist AMF in accessing organic nutrients by degrading complex organic compounds that AMF are unable to do by themselves. The AMF, in return, provide an energy-rich microhabitat supplied with hyphal exudates that facilitates microbial growth and mobility in the hyphosphere. However, our current knowledge of hyphosphere entities, their trophic interactions and functional roles, and the underlying mechanisms facilitating microbial co-occurrence and co-operation is largely incomplete. Here, we review the current state of knowledge on the identity and putative roles of AMF hyphae-associated microbes, with a specific focus on prokaryotes, and potential drivers of such microbial communities in the hyphosphere.

818,pub.1019620567,10.1666/05028.1,,,,Testing the role of biological interactions in the evolution of mid-Mesozoic marine benthic ecosystems,"Evaluating the relative importance of biotic versus abiotic factors in governing macroevolutionary patterns is a central question of paleobiology. Here, we analyzed patterns of changes in global relative abundances and diversity of ecological groups to infer the role of biological interactions as driving evolutionary forces in mid-Mesozoic macrobenthic marine ecosystems. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis of escalation, which states that macroevolutionary patterns were controlled by an increasing pressure exerted by enemies on their victims. Associated with evidence of increasing levels of predation and biogenic sediment reworking (bulldozing) is an increasing representation of predation- and disturbance-resistant groups in the fossil record. In particular, we observe increasing proportions of mobile organisms; a decline of vulnerable epifauna living freely on the substrate; and a trend toward infaunalization of the benthos. These trends were most pronounced in the paleotropics, i.e., the region where biological activity is thought to have been highest. The observation that these changes affected several biotic traits and occurred within independent clades argues against the overriding role of a single key adaptive innovation in causing shifts in ecological abundance. Also, changes in the abiotic environment cannot explain these faunal patterns because of lacking cross-correlations with physico-chemical parameters such as global sea level, climate, and seawater chemistry. We conclude that in marine benthic ecosystems of the mid Mesozoic, enemy-driven evolution, or escalation, was a plausible and important factor.",We thank G. Herbert and G.

To overcome the lack of information on the spatial distribution patterns of gorgonians in south Portugal, in 2009/2010, the occurrence and abundance of gorgonian species in rocky bottoms were quantified over more than 25 km of coast (37.1°N/8.6°W) down to 30 m depth. Eunicella labiata, Eunicella gazella, Eunicella verrucosa and Leptogorgia sarmentosa were abundant and frequent in the studied area, while Leptogorgia lusitanica was less abundant. All species evidenced a similar depth pattern, that is abundance significantly increased with depth below 15 m. At shallower waters (up to 15 m), the distribution of gorgonians may be constrained by abiotic factors and competition with algae. Indeed, the abundance of gorgonians was negatively correlated with the percentage cover of algae along the depth gradient, but gorgonians and sponges coexist. Competition among gorgonian species also seems to be low in this area because of the similarity in the abundance pattern observed for the most abundant species and also their high association. In NE Atlantic shallow temperate rocky bottoms, the distribution of gorgonians seems to be influenced by environmental factors and biological interactions, namely competition (algae) and coexistence (sponges and other gorgonians).","J.C.

Retrospective analyses of intertidal (1988–1992) and subtidal (1971–2012) species compositions from a long-term ecological research program in Port Valdez, Alaska evaluated associations between benthic community structure and physical conditions to better understand interactions between regional to local processes on flora and fauna. Low salinity, habitat structure (varying from mudflats to rocky shores over a distance of <18 km), and suspended sediments contributed to intertidal community structure via elimination of predators from low-salinity prey refugia. Subtidal communities demonstrate adjustments by macrofauna to sedimentation with smaller, disturbance-tolerant fauna towards the head of the fjord as well as effects from depth-related covariates. Shared ecological processes result in comparable community trends in subtidal and intertidal habitats among subarctic and arctic fjords and similarly among coastal environments of the North Pacific. Control exerted by interactions among climatic, oceanographic, and local processes interacting with biota contributes to the direction and length of recovery from disturbance events and environmental changes. Feedbacks, mediation of recovery by additional processes, and strengths of interactions also play important roles in determining interaction outcomes. Interactions among local, regional, and global-scale processes may become critical sources of change as global ecosystem transitions through new climate states.",This work was funded by Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.

For interaction terms to be biologically meaningful, it is critical that the statistical method used tests a model that corresponds to a realistic null hypothesis. A commonly used data analysis method, the analysis of variance F-test (ANOVA), is limited when examining interactions because there are a limited number of statistical models that it can test. This is further complicated by the fact that data transformations, which affect the model being tested, are sometimes required to meet ANOVA's assumptions. Thus, when using ANOVA, it can be difficult to determine whether interactions that are found in data were produced by biological mechanisms or are statistical artifacts due to an unrealistic model. A survey of the literature indicated that these shortcomings are often not recognized despite ANOVA's widespread use. In this paper, we evaluate the suitability of an alternate method, permutation tests, compared to ANOVA. We compare the range of potential statistical models that each method can test and the power of each method to detect interactions when using an appropriate model. We provide two simulated experiments on species interactions that show that ANOVA and permutation tests have similar power when testing an appropriate statistical model, but that permutation tests provide an advantage over ANOVA in their ability to test a wider range of models. We conclude that permutation tests can be used to make inferences, potentially impossible with ANOVA, concerning biological interactions.","We thank Earl Werner, Tim Wootton, and several anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on an earlier draft of this manuscript.

Current knowledge is summarized, important gaps are indicated and research priorities are suggested. Although all savannas consist of a grass and a woody component, the physical determinants, biological interactions and individual species properties are unique to each spatial and temporal situation. In addition, past management has resulted in different kinds and degrees of modification. Primary and secondary determinants are discussed in terms of how they influence the structure and productivity of savanna communities. More than one outcome is possible to any competitive interaction owing to the modification of the effects of determinants by changing weather sequences, asymmetrical competition and biological interactions. This contrasts sharply with the conventional rangeland succession model. Relations between woody and herbaceous plants are often discontinuous because of the dynamic interactions between determinants, plants and herbivory. There is an apparent discrepancy between the convex and concave response of grass productivity to increasing woody biomass. It is hypothesized that a single discontinuous function explains this apparent discrepancy. This unifying theorem accounts for the modifications due to changes in levels of determinants and different species mixes within and between sites. With a few notable exceptions, research in southern Africa has been of an ad hoc, empirical and limited nature. It has not aimed at achieving an understanding and a predictive capability beyond the site and circumstances of individual trials themselves. A case is made for a systems‐orientated research approach, so that site and situation‐specific problems can be solved to fulfil management objectives.",,,Journal of the Grassland Society of Southern Africa,,Taylor & Francis,0256-6702,,1992-06,1992,,1992-06,9,2,60-71,Closed,Article,"Teague, W.R.; Smit, G.N.","Teague, W.R.

In this work, we report for the first time on the use of flowers as sleeping places by five species of Chilean flies of the genus Lasia (Acroceridae) in central Chile. In addition, we seek to determine whether the flower shape and/or color might be good predictors for flies using them as sleeping places. We used standardized records from a long-term citizen science project that exclusively monitors flies. We counted the number of flies that used flowers as a sleeping place and discretized the morphological variables of the flowers to relate both responses and predictors with a generalized linear model. We found that flowers belonging to the genus Alstroemeria, followed by Clarkia and Salpiglossis, were the most used as sleeping places. Our results suggest that zygomorphic flowers (with bilateral symmetry, and usually tubular flowers) are a better predictor than actinomorphic flowers and their color. The use of zygomorphic flowers could represent a better option for flies in adverse environmental conditions or to avoid predators, but the use of flowers as sleeping places could be an as-yet poorly understood way of pollinating plants. Citizen science, although it has some limitations (taxonomic, spatial or temporal biases), has great potential for describing new biological interactions in a changing world.","We thank all the citizen scientists of the Moscas Florícolas de Chile group who have contributed with their records in the years that the project has worked.

Here, we use the tree species Taxus baccata to explore the effects of including biologically meaningful information on processes and features beyond purely abiotic factors that are expected to determine its niche and range size. To elucidate how these often neglected factors affect C-SDM results, we modelled the current niche in the species’ southernmost European range using Maxent. More specifically, we included available basic information regarding biotic interactions, local adaptation and non-equilibrium demographic dynamics. The potential effect of biological interactions was introduced using habitat suitability of co-occurring tree species as predictive variables. Local adaptation was included modelling two distinct regional adaptive groups. We also used individual growth estimated under field conditions as a surrogate for demographic behaviour to control for the quality of model predictions and empirically assess the effect of biotic interactions. Including information on co-occurring tree species improved model performance and decreased the projected range size in most cases. These effects were not a result of biological interactions per se, but instead a consequence of co-occurring species accounting for fine-scale environmental variability not described by any of the climatic variables used. Considering local adaptation allowed detecting the role of different climatic variables in shaping the niche of each adaptive group that could potentially also act as selective pressures in the near future. Finally, and more importantly, we found that including populations that are probably currently found under non-equilibrium suboptimal conditions might largely overestimate the species niche.","We particularly thank E. Berganzo for the field work and many local botanical experts, among them X. Rotllan, R. Bernal, F.

An experiment was designed for the purpose of distinguishing seasonal phenology from site-specific temporal (nonseasonal) succession of colonizers. Subsequent to initial colonization, patterns of species dominance were analyzed to develop hypotheses on the potential for biological interactions as explanations for observed patterns of species succession. Total benthos and species richness increased significantly with duration of exposure of experimental substrates indicating the occurrence of nonseasonal succession. However, seasonal fluctuations in abiotic variables (water temperature, current, and water depth) were also shown to have significant effects on colonization. Colonization patterns were species specific; although most species showed gradual increases in numbers given longer exposure of substrates, some showed peak densities within the first few or after intermediate sampling periods, suggestive of competitive displacement of early by later colonists. Association analysis was conducted on the abundances of 19 species pairs within four functional feeding groups to determine the degree of co-occurrence in cages or concordance of colonization patterns. Negative associations were notably absent, and positive associations were common, especially among the filter-feeders and shredders. Positive associations could be interpreted as evidence for lack of ecological divergence (no competition), or potential for present competition. This study documents the existence of site-specific temporal succession of invertebrates in a temperate woodland stream, but does not resolve the question of the importance of biological interactions in determining community changes following initial colonization. Data gathered on a smaller spatial scale would be more sensitive to detecting negative species associations.",,,Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences,,Canadian Science Publishing,"0706-652X, 1205-7533",,1986-03-01,1986,,1986-03-01,43,3,700-709,Closed,Article,"Peckarsky, Barbara L.","Peckarsky, Barbara L.

Manipulative field experiments assessed the relative roles of environmental state and biotic interactions in determining temporal succession along a spatial gradient in vent fluid flux at three vent sites near 9°50′ N on the East Pacific Rise (2500 m water depth). Species colonization patterns on cubic basalt blocks (10 cm on a side) deployed by the submersible Alvin revealed both positive (facilitation) and negative (inhibition) biological interactions, in the context of established succession theory. Over a series of four cruises from 1994 to 1998, blocks were exposed to colonists for consecutive and continuous intervals in short‐term (5 + 8 = 13 mo) and longer‐term (8 + 29 = 37 mo) experiments. Colonists grouped into a mobile functional group were less abundant in the continuous interval (13 mo) than in the synchronous pooled‐consecutive intervals (5 + 8 mo) of the short‐term experiment, indicating that early colonists inhibited subsequent recruitment. Colonists grouped into a sessile functional group exhibited the opposite pattern, indicating facilitation. Similar trends, though not statistically significant, were observed in the longer‐term experiment. The character of species interactions varied along a gradient in hydrothermal fluid flux (and inferred productivity), with inhibitory interactions more prominent in zones with high temperatures, productivity, and faunal densities, and facilitative interactions appearing where temperatures, productivity, and densities were low. Analyses of primary succession on introduced basalt blocks suggest that biological interactions during early vent community development strongly modify initial patterns of settlement, even in the absence of sustained temporal change in the vent fluid flux.

782,pub.1005082409,10.1659/mrd.0964,,,,Agricultural Land Use and Biodiversity in the Alps,"Alpine grasslands are ecosystems with a great diversity of plant species. However, little is known about other levels of biodiversity, such as landscape diversity, diversity of biological interactions of plants with herbivores or fungal pathogens, and genetic diversity. We therefore explored natural and anthropogenic determinants of grassland biodiversity at several levels of biological integration, from the genetic to the landscape level in the Swiss Alps. Differences between cultural traditions (Romanic, Germanic, and Walser) turned out to still affect land use diversity and thus landscape diversity. Increasing land use diversity, in turn, increased plant species diversity per village. However, recent land use changes have reduced this diversity. Within grassland parcels, plant species diversity was higher on unfertilized mown grasslands than on fertilized or grazed ones. Most individual plants were affected by herbivores and fungal leaf pathogens, reflecting that parcels harbored a great diversity of herbivores and pathogens. However, as plant damage by herbivores and pathogens was not severe, conserving these biological interactions among plants is hardly compromising agricultural goals. A common-garden experiment revealed genetic differentiation of the important fodder grass Poa alpina between mown and grazed sites, suggesting adaptation. Pervillage genetic diversity of Poa alpina was greater in villages with higher land use diversity, analogous to the higher plant species diversity there. Overall, landscape diversity and biodiversity within grassland parcels are currently declining. As this contradicts the intention of Swiss law and international agreements, financial incentives need to be re-allocated and should focus on promoting high biodiversity at the local and the landscape level. At the same time, this will benefit landscape attractiveness for tourists and help preserve a precious cultural heritage in the Swiss Alps.","We thank all involved municipalities, local contact persons, and all farmers who allowed us to work and collect plants on their land.

750,pub.1000157458,10.1002/rra.1274,,,,Linking the hydraulic world of individual organisms to ecological processes: Putting ecology into ecohydraulics,"Ecohydraulics is a relatively new name for a long‐standing field investigating the interactions between ecology and the physics of flowing water. In recent decades, a burgeoning literature has developed relating species' densities to environmental variables, particularly those associated with flow. These abundance–environment relations (AERs) are sometimes used in habitat‐based association models (HAMs) to predict changes to species' abundances, especially human‐caused changes to the environment. Unfortunately, some conclusions arising from AERs are based on untenable ecological assertions or faulty assumptions including: illogical inference of cause‐and‐effect, muddling of hypotheses such as ‘habitat preference’ with other causal mechanisms, outdated ideas about environmental tolerance and optimization. Furthermore, the effects of biological interactions in AERs are routinely ignored, when biological interactions form the core of most modern models in community ecology. HAMs underpinned by AERs are often used to predict changes in populations, but lack information on demographic rates (births, deaths, migration), which are essential for population‐level predictions. These weaknesses are discussed at length and, we suggest, must be acknowledged and surmounted if ecohydraulics is to advance our understanding of stream ecosystems and our capacity to manage streams. We give two examples of research at the ecological–physical interface that are grounded in ecological principles: (1) how flow influences feeding rates of filter‐feeding insects (Simuliidae and Hydropsychidae) and the consequences for larval growth rates, adult body size and fecundity, and (2) how the physical factors that determine the density of rocks emergent from the water's surface may affect population densities of insects where females lay their eggs on emergent rocks. Ecohydraulics is an interdisciplinary field that requires expertise in both ecology and hydraulics, and true interdisciplinary teams may have the best prospects of addressing the many unanswered and untackled questions.

749,pub.1011238564,10.1002/rra.2879,,,,"A Community‐Level, Mesoscale Analysis of Fish Assemblage Structure in Shoreline Habitats of a Large River Using Multivariate Regression Trees","The mesoscale (100–102 m) of river habitats has been identified as the scale that simultaneously offers insights into ecological structure and falls within the practical bounds of river management. Mesoscale habitat (mesohabitat) classifications for relatively large rivers, however, are underdeveloped compared with those produced for smaller streams. Approaches to habitat modelling have traditionally focused on individual species or proceeded on a species‐by‐species basis. This is particularly problematic in larger rivers where the effects of biological interactions are more complex and intense. Community‐level approaches can rapidly model many species simultaneously, thereby integrating the effects of biological interactions while providing information on the relative importance of environmental variables in structuring the community. One such community‐level approach, multivariate regression trees, was applied in order to determine the relative influences of abiotic factors on fish assemblages within shoreline mesohabitats of San Pedro River, Chile, and to define reference communities prior to the planned construction of a hydroelectric power plant. Flow depth, bank materials and the availability of riparian and instream cover, including woody debris, were the main variables driving differences between the assemblages. Species strongly indicative of distinctive mesohabitat types included the endemic Galaxias platei. Among other outcomes, the results provide information on the impact of non‐native salmonids on river‐dwelling Galaxias platei, suggesting a degree of habitat segregation between these taxa based on flow depth. The results support the use of the mesohabitat concept in large, relatively pristine river systems, and they represent a basis for assessing the impact of any future hydroelectric power plant construction and operation. By combing community classifications with simple sets of environmental rules, the multivariate regression trees produced can be used to predict the community structure of any mesohabitat along the reach.

Physical factors generally set the upper limits of species distributions whereas biological interactions generally set their lower limits. However, recent research has shown that biological factors can also influence the upper limits of species' recruitment and colonisation. Whereas such evidence has been shown for rocky shores internationally, little experimental evidence exists for South African shores. This study provided such evidence for the biological effects of long-term exclusion (for the period 2003-2008) of the South African herbivorous limpet Cymbula oculus (Born), on the community structure of the Kalk Bay rocky intertidal zone on the South African south-western Cape coast. To demonstrate this, a herbivore exclusion experiment was set up in the mid-eulittoral zone in May 2003. Initially, all herbivores were removed from the exclusion plots; after one year, only C. oculus individuals recruiting into the plots were continually removed. Algal recruitment (percentage cover abundance) was determined monthly for the first 12 months and then annually thereafter, whereas invertebrate recruitment (density) was monitored only annually. The results showed that the natural density of C. oculus had increased markedly during the first year (from 4.87 ± 1.09 individuals m-2 to 12.35 ± 1.70 individuals m-2, p = 0.001), and that grazing by C. oculus is the primary biological factor preventing the recruitment and colonisation of macroalgae and some invertebrates onto the Kalk Bay intertidal zone. Not only does herbivory by C. oculus prevent recruitment and colonisation, but it also decreases algal diversity and prevents algal succession. Within the mid-eulittoral zone of the Kalk Bay rocky intertidal zone, herbivory by C. oculus is thus more important in structuring this marine community than physical factors associated with desiccation stress.",,,African Journal of Marine Science,,Taylor & Francis,"0257-7615, 1814-232X, 1814-2338",,2009-08-01,2009,2010-04-09,2009-08-01,31,2,171-179,All OA; Green,Article,"Maneveldt, G W; Eager, R C; Bassier, A","Maneveldt, G W (Department of Biodiversity and Conservation Biology, University of the Western Cape, Private Bag X17, Bellville, 7535, South Africa); Eager, R C (Department of Biodiversity and Conservation Biology, University of the Western Cape, Private Bag X17, Bellville, 7535, South Africa); Bassier, A (Department of Biodiversity and Conservation Biology, University of the Western Cape, Private Bag X17, Bellville, 7535, South Africa)","Maneveldt, G W (University of the Western Cape)","Maneveldt, G W (University of the Western Cape); Eager, R C (University of the Western Cape); Bassier, A (University of the Western Cape)",University of the Western Cape,grid.8974.2,Cape Town,Western Cape,South Africa,,,,,,13,6,,1.22,,https://repository.uwc.ac.za:443/xmlui/bitstream/10566/635/4/ManeveldtIntertidalOrganisms2009.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1070960461,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,14 Life Below Water

However, the responses of shrubs and trees to climate change may be modulated by other environmental drivers such as land-use change and biological interactions. The European Alps are one of the three areas experiencing the most intense warming globally in the twentieth century. We analyse, through a multidisciplinary approach, the shrub and tree encroachment at the Stelvio Pass (Italian Alps) focusing on three target species (Rhododendron ferrugineum, Larix decidua, Pinus mugo) to reconstruct their dynamics and assess which drivers (climate change, land-use change, biological interactions provided by shrub facilitation) promoted their ingression. Shrub colonization started in 1867, in coincidence with the end of the Little Ice Age. Tree recruitment started since 1960 for P. mugo and 1972 for L. decidua and correlated strongly with air warming and shortening of the snow cover duration. Climate (air temperature, snow cover) exhibited the highest correlation with shrub and tree dynamics both during the period of recruitment and in the following and preceding 5-year period. Air warming appeared to be crucial for tree ingression and persistence. Land-use change was not related to shrub encroachment, and only weakly to tree recruitment. Both the correlation analysis as well as the patterns of recruitment highlighted that shrubs were characterized by different ecological requirements from trees. There was not a “nurse effect” of shrubs on trees, and this biotic interaction changed with the developmental stage of the involved species, being lowest for seedlings and highest for adults, requiring further investigations. Future scenarios of climate change indicate a further and intense warming, and our data show that it is likely that shrub and tree encroachment will proceed, with relevant consequences on the extremely vulnerable high-elevation alpine ecosystems.",We thank Stelvio National Park for logistical support and a2a for providing the climatic data.

Mortality of adults after spawning and variable larval settlement success probably explained much of the variation in population numbers of the four large and numerically important polychaete species, Lumbrineris inflata, Axiothella rubrocincta, Platynereis bicanaliculata, and Armandia brevis. No correlations were found between the abundances of numerically important species and physical factors. Exclosures constructed of 3—mm mesh plastic screening placed on the flat became covered with diatoms. Settling juveniles of tube—building species, such as P. bicanaliculata, Axiothella rubrocincta, and L. inflata, built tubes in this layer of diatoms and thus did not reach the enclosed sediment, while settling juveniles of a burrowing species, Armandia brevis, burrowed through the diatom layer and reached the sediment. Thus, cleaning the cage surfaces or removing the cage after settlement reduced abundances of tube—building species without disturbing the sediment since adults of all three numerically important tube builders experience mortality after spawning. The manipulation of tube—builder abundances showed that the burrowing species responded to space vacated by tube builders by increased settlement success. Results from experimental variation of A. brevis numbers per unit volume of sediment in the laboratory and abundance data from unmanipulated natural areas also demonstrated the presence of interspecific and intraspecific competition for space. Changes in physical factors due to algal cover had some impact on population levels but the competitive interactions and behavior patterns, revealed only by observations on the behavior of living organisms and manipulation of the infauna, demonstrated the importance of biological interactions to the determination of species abundance patterns in a soft—sediment environment.",,,Ecological Monographs,,Wiley,"0012-9615, 1557-7015",,1974-03,1974,,1974-03,44,2,171-187,Closed,Article,"Woodin, Sarah Ann","Woodin, Sarah Ann ()",,"Woodin, Sarah Ann ()",,,,,,,,,,,220,6,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1069664749,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 41 Environmental Sciences,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,14 Life Below Water

The tribe Asphondyliini is a well‐circumscribed monophyletic group of Cecidomyiidae and all species are known as gall inducers. Species belonging to this tribe exhibit fascinating ecological traits such as host alternation, polyphagy, extended diapause, induction of dimorphic galls and association with fungal symbionts. For these reasons, biogeographical and phylogenetic studies of Asphondyliini are of interest in elucidating the evolution of these traits, and particularly the processes of host‐range expansion, host‐plant shift and shifts in gall‐bearing organs. In order to facilitate further evolutionary studies of Asphondyliini, I review studies of systematics, biogeography, phylogeny, speciation, cytology, behavior, ecology, physiology, biological interaction and economic importance in this tribe.","I express my sincere gratitude to Dr. J.

Classical approaches consider fluxes of energy and matter between species and populations to describe marine ecosystems but biological interactions occur between individuals rather than between the abstract entities of ‘populations’ or “trophic levels.” A complementary approach is to derive system properties from mechanistic insights in individual functioning and interactions. Plankton live in a world that is radically different from ours, and to which we have limited access. Visualization is central to developing an intuition for this world, which together with insights in small‐scale fluid physics may allow a mechanistic understanding of individual interactions and deduction of properties of populations and ecosystems.

Gould argued that three major questions have dominated paleontological thinking for more than a century. Does the history of life have direction? What is the motor of evolutionary change? And, what is the tempo of change? Certainly, these “eternal metaphors” have figured prominently in the research of invertebrate paleontologists during the past decade. Temporal pattern has been sought in changing morphologies within lineages, the changing structure and composition of communities, trends in taxonomic diversity, and even the occurrence of mass extinctions. Drifting continents, changing climates and oceanic circulation patterns, biological interactions, and extraterrestrial influences have all been championed as significant determinants of evolutionary change.

It is a theory that has the potential to causally link material processes at all biological levels—from molecules to the biosphere. But the lack of a coherent operational framework has so far restricted progress in this direction. Here, we provide a framework to help infer how a stoichiometric imbalance observed at one level impacts all other biological levels. Our framework enables us to highlight the areas of the theory in need of completion, development and integration at all biological levels. Our hope is that this framework will contribute to the building of a more predictive theory of elemental transfers within the biosphere, and thus, to a better understanding of human-induced perturbations to the global biogeochemical cycles.","MC was supported by the strong research environment “Ecosystem Change” of Umeå University.

These early botanical achievements were ignored by zoologists whose subsequent, independently derived ideas about competition paralleled those of plant ecologists to a remarkable degree.

Krill are viewed as being particles on a conveyor belt that carries them around the Antarctic continent resulting in a single circumpolar population. The evidence to support this viewpoint is largely circumstantial and there is very little direct evidence available of krill being moved by the currents-krill flux. There is also considerable biological and physical evidence which suggests that other factors may play a dominant role in the life history and distribution of krill.

This study investigated the short‐term (3 weeks) stability in spatial patterns of eight common, potentially mobile, near‐surface macrofaunal species inhabiting a 4,000‐m2 area of intertidal sandflat. Over this period, wind conditions reworked the sediment to a depth of 3 cm, thus generating sediment and animal transport. Movement and changes in spatial arrangement of juvenile Macomona liliana and Paphies australis demonstrated the need to consider postsettlement dispersal in survivorship and experimental studies and to conduct such studies at a relevant scale. However, the majority of the species exhibited stability of spatial pattern, even when undergoing movement and changes in mean density.

The response of nutrient supply on primary producers and Tricorythodes sp., a common mayfly grazer, was determined in experimental chambers set in a tropical, high Andean stream. Chambers in an experimentally fertilized reach developed higher amount of both benthic and detached chlorophyll than chambers in an upstream control reach. Fertilization produced a slight increase in grazer biomass, and reduced algal biomass compared to grazer-free chambers. These results show that nutrient excess spread bottom-up effects through the food web, and that relevant top-down effects could also be detected.

Consequently, environmentally‐corrected single‐species models will be more effective in assessing changes in stock abundance and habitat preferences of mobile species in the IRL.

These species are common epifaunal associates of hermit crabs. Although adult populations exhibit strongly divergent resource utilization patterns, these patterns are not generally the result of divergent colonization processes. All three Crepidula species selectively colonize small shells rather than large shells, are strongly inhibited from colonizing shells dominated by the colonial hydroid Hydractinia echinata Fleming (but not by the colonial bryozoan Alcyonidium polyoum Hassall), and co-occur on individual shells in the absence of other epifauna.

Infection by parasites (from eukaryotes to bacteria or viruses) can reduce this individual fitness, altering the infected individuals' sexual traits and molecular cues. In this case, one would expect to observe mechanisms for avoiding infection during mate choice. The vast majority of host responses to infection in terms of mate choice are intended to avoid infection, but the costs of mate choice can also hinder infection avoidance. This paper highlights the main limitations in current knowledge and empirical experiments, and summarizes the key factors that should be taken into account to test the hypothesis of infection avoidance in mate choice: the time of host–parasite coevolution in the biological interaction implied, the choosy sex tested (male, female or both) and the genetic background of the individuals tested.","We thank Mathieu Sicard, Nicolas Bech, David Puga, Alexander Hurley and the referees for their constructive comments and their help in improving our manuscript.

In addition, bacteria species composition in the treatment with high meiofauna abundance was significantly different from the treatment with low meiofauna abundance, indicating that the activities of meiofauna in the sediments had an effect on the bacterial community composition.

Significant positive correlations are also often found in recruitment among demersal, offshore-spawning species (cod, haddock, and redfish (Sebastes spp.)), and recruitment in these groups tends to be negatively correlated with that of pelagic species, which spawn inshore (herring) or in restricted waters (mackerel (Scomber scombrus)). These patterns emerge as well from a principal component (PC) analysis of the recruitment data. Three dominant patterns (PC 1–3) explain 78% of the variance of the data set.

We investigate these relationships using a family of simple non‐linear Markov chain models.

By adding a third competing species we also compare transitive competitive hierarchies and intransitive competitive networks.

During such years, plankton biomass was relatively low. Conversely, Pacific mackerel survival rates to age 1 were low during periods of increased southward transport, when plankton biomass was high. We conclude that survival rates during the early life history may be more influenced by hydrographic processes in a direct manner than by biological interactions.

In coastal m arine systems, physical oceanographic processes affecting larval stages are as, or more important than, biological interactions affecting adults. In terrestrial systems, the membership in ecological communities is controlled by geologic transport processes as much as by species interactions. Hence ecological science has become increasingly an earth science, and less a biological science. The differences between marine and terrestrial ecosystems imply that terrestrial systems are more localized functionally than marine systems; more likely to suffer extinction from habitat loss; and less likely to recover upon removal of stress. In addition, damage to a marine system is more likely to be felt further from the source of stress than it would in a terrestrial system.

The general increase in biomass and densities of macrofauna has been attributed to an increased supply of degradable organic matter to the sediment.In this study, the effect of eutrophication on benthic Foraminifera is shown in a comparison of foraminiferal data from Recent sediment layers (the upper 2 cm of short sediment cores) with layers deposited more than 42 years B.P. (24–25 cm core interval). Foraminiferal densities are significantly lower in the Recent sediment with no large scale changes in the assemblage composition.

Since at most sites the mid-intertidal zone contains both rocks and mussels, organisms face a choice of which substratum to live upon. Because the two substrata differ in physical characteristics, and biological interactions could differ on the two substrata, it may be better to live on one substratum than the other.Comparisons of population dynamics of three species common on both substrata revealed that while growth and reproductive status were not affected by the type of substratum, both survivorship and recruitment were higher on mussels. Therefore, this suggests that it is better to live on mussels.

Results Repeated volcanic events have changed the topography of the islands and created periodic further isolates. There has been climatic fluctuation and varying sea level. Individual locations are not species‐rich, but there is replacement from one subregion to another. Evidence of competitive interactions is lacking. Main conclusions High diversity results from the fortuitous coincidence of rates of geological and climatic change and isolation on the one hand, and migration and genetic divergence on the other. Hubbell’s neutral model of biodiversity explains species richness if a factor is added describing structural instability or periodicity, here called the geodetic rate.

However, many existing models for deep lakes neglect their impact. Here, we tested the hypothesis that submerged macrophytes can affect the water clarity in deep lakes. A one-dimensional, vertically resolved macrophyte model was developed based on PCLake and coupled to SALMO-1D and GOTM hydrophysics and validated against field data. Validation showed good coherence in dynamic growth patterns and colonisation depths. In our simulations the presence of submerged macrophytes resulted in up to 50% less phytoplankton biomass in the shallowest simulated lake (11 m) and still 15% less phytoplankton was predicted in 100 m deep oligotrophic lakes. Nutrient loading, lake depth, and lake shape had a strong influence on macrophyte effects. Nutrient competition was found to be the strongest biological interaction. Despite a number of limitations, the derived dynamic lake model suggests significant effects of submerged macrophytes on deep lake water quality.","This study was performed in the research projects NITROLIMIT and INKA-BB, funded by German Ministry of Research and Education, grant nr. 033L041A, 033L041E, 01LR0803D, 01LR0803G.

This review focuses on the relationships among the components of picophytoplankton (picocyanobacteria and the picoplanktic eukaryotes) and biotic and abiotic environmental factors. The dynamics of picophytoplankton in aquatic ecosystems are strictly dependent upon basin size and trophy, temperature, and nutrient and light limitation, but they are also regulated by grazing and viral-induced lysis. The review considers: the pros and cons of the molecular approach to the study of the taxonomy of freshwater Synechococcus spp.; the importance of ecological aspects in understanding the puzzle of picophytoplankton phylogeny (genotype vs ecotype); and the role of biotic vs abiotic interactions in controlling picophytoplankton dynamics. Biotic, top-down control mechanisms are reviewed as well as knowledge of other biological interactions.","I thank all my staff, students and technicians who have helped me in the collection and analysis of picophytoplankton data.

Here, using variation partitioning, we show that the community composition of fungi associated with moss colonies sparsely distributed in ice-free coastal outcrops of East Antarctica is affected by a suite of environmental conditions more significantly than by geographic distance, indicating the primary importance of niche-related factors. This was mainly attributable to the widespread occurrence of the predominant, cosmopolitan fungal species, Phoma herbarum. The variance explained by spatial factors increased when the analysis was applied only to the dataset of the Lützow-Holm Bay area (by excluding the data of the Amundsen Bay area, which is 500 km from the Lützow-Holm Bay area), indicating the local importance of non-niche-related processes.",We thank Dr. Y.

In a series of preference experiments, differences between the sediments of the two habitats in granulometry and organic matter were shown not to account for the preference. Rather, the preference results from differences in the microbes attached to the sediment particles in the two areas. In contrast, Zausodes c.f. arenicolus did nol prefer sediments from its area of high field abundance in laboratory preference experiments, indicating that factors external to the sediment i.e. hydrographic conditions or biological interactions, were responsible for this species' distribution.",,,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology,,Elsevier,"0022-0981, 1879-1697",,1981-03,1981,,1981-03,50,2-3,289-301,Closed,Article,"Ravenel, William S.; Thistle, David","Ravenel, William S.

It is proposed that the phylogenetical differentiation of basidiocarp structures may be very old and many species have remained unchanged. Subsequent evolution has to a great part been the effect of biological interaction with the environment, like colonization of new substrata, and the formation of species complexes may be a consequence of this. The amount of spores liberated from a single basidiocarp is regarded as an adaptive character for dispersal mainly in the immediate environment. The actual, wide distribution of many species is supposed to be associated with expansion of pertaining forest types in the past. When rapid expansion of a species occurs it is likely to be connected with occupation of a new ecological niche.

However, a field experiment in a phosphorus‐limited lake showed that production of zooplankton herbivores was increased by shading. This paradoxical outcome was caused by a decoupling of producer carbon fixation and nutrient uptake under high light that reduced food quality for herbivores. At low nutrient supplies, shading increased nutrient contents relative to carbon within algal food, outweighing effects of decreased primary production. Thus, light/nutrient balance affects the degree of mismatch between primary producers and herbivores in nature, which in turn influences mass‐transfer efficiencies along food chains. To predict how energy transfer efficiency and biological interactions will respond to perturbations, it is essential to take into account changes in light/nutrient balance and its effects on the stoichiometry of autotroph–herbivore interactions.","We thank P.

The sponges, enveloped in plastic bags underwater just after collection, revealed in the laboratory the presence of a structured epibiotic assembly on their surface. This assembly appears to be ""stratified"" into three zones: (1) the sponge body, (2) the sponge basal platform, and (3) a zone in which valves of the scallop Adamussium colbecki are embedded into the sponge itself to stabilise it (snow-shoe effect), if the sponge lives on soft bottoms. Some biological interactions occur inside this epibiotic assembly, ranging from direct predation (mollusc vs sponge) to probable commensalisms (isopod vs mollusc). The hosted mollusc belongs to an Atlanto-Mediterranean bathyal genus (Krachia) never before recognised in Antarctica.","We would like to thank Winfried Engl for his invaluable help in the determination of Krachia antarctica and Marco Taviani (I.G.M.-C.N.R., Bologna, Italy) for the loan of several Ross Sea cerithiopsids.

We explored how the attenuation of physical conditions by seaweed plots comprised of either Chondracanthus canaliculatus, Pyropia perforata, Sylvetia compressa or a mixed aggregation, at varying densities (average 1,199, 816, and 408 in. m−2), affected recruitment of seaweeds and microphytobenthic organisms in the understory, and if physical factors modulate their abundance and distribution. We outplanted macroscopic seaweeds in the intertidal and measured changes in understory irradiance, particle retention, and bulk water flow. Both factors influenced physical conditions below the canopy. However, only canopy density had a significant effect on recruitment. The low-density canopy treatments had a greater abundance of seaweed recruits, with the opposite found for microphytobenthic organisms. The recruitment processes of seaweeds and microphytobenthic organisms, however, appeared to be independent of each other and were not due to competition. We conclude that it is crucial to consider microscale biological interactions, which are rarely addressed when assessing recruitment processes of benthic primary producers.",We would like to thank Dr. David Siqueiros and Alberto Galvez for their feedback in identifying and photographing the microorganisms.

In the intertidal zone there was a large recruitment of E. laevigata in the spring. The kelp were largely excluded from a zone in the lowest intertidal zone where the surf grass Phyllospadix sp, grew, but were abundant on all other rock surfaces. Experiments demonstrated that, while neither grazers nor sessile organisms significantly reduced recruitment, E. laevigata of the previous year-class did so. There were also interactions among E. laevigata of the same year-class, expressed as a density-dependent mortality of very small algae, and as faster growth rates and greater number of branches of kelp at low densities. These processes tended to make both numbers and biomass of E. laevigata uniform. The mortality rates of large E. laevigata were so high that, in some locations, no kelp survived for more than 8 months. E. laevigata was, therefore, essentially an annual and opportunistic species in the intertidal zone.",,,Marine Biology,,Springer Nature,"0025-3162, 1432-1793",,1974-12,1974,,1974-12,28,3,189-198,Closed,Article,"Black, R.","Black, R.

Both species share characteristics with all other species of the Scinax catharinae group, including oral discs not emarginated with the posterior margin concave when closed, many submarginal papillae laterally, circular nostrils, and vent tubes reaching the ventral fin margin. Landmark-based geometric morphometrics applied to 16 species of the S. catharinae group indicate that their tadpoles have substantial variation in body shape, yet with some overlap among species. Although the lentic/lotic habitat categorization was not sufficient for explaining the complex patterns of morphospace occupancy by tadpoles of S. catharinae group, some well-established ecomorphological relationships were recovered, such as that for suctorial and pond-type guilds. Moreover, the morphological diversity in shape may also reflect interspecific variation in microhabitat use, other contemporary factors (e.g., other abiotic habitat components and/or biological interactions) and evolutionary relationships.","We are thankful to Erik Wild and Deborah Bower for critically reading the manuscript and helping with the English; to L.O.

We used structural equation modeling and dissimilarities in nine ecological variables to investigate community processes underlying the turnover of species and their interaction frequencies (interaction pattern) among highly resolved plant–pollinator networks. Floral and pollinator community composition, i.e., species identities and their abundances, were strong determinants of the microstructure of pairwise interactions among the networks, explaining almost 69% of their variation. Flower and pollinator traits were directly related to interaction patterns, but were partly masked in the model by shared variance with community composition. Time of year and geographic location, floral and pollinator abundances independent of species identity, and relative abundance of exotic flowers had indirect and relatively weak effects on interaction patterns. Our analyses lead to precise predictions about the processes behind the interaction patterns in mutualistic networks. Future understanding of these processes will be aided by studies that evaluate these predictions experimentally at the network level.","The networks were collected in collaboration with the National Park Authority and the Environment Department, Seychelles.

Algal buoyancy and surface bloom formation were enhanced markedly by decreased light intensity, and to a lesser extent by decreased CO2 availability and increased availability of inorganic nitrogen. In the absence of dense populations of large-bodied Cladocera, early season blooms of diatoms and green algae reduced light availability in the ponds thus creating conditions favorable for increased buoyancy and bloom formation by A. Elenkinii. The appearance of blue-green algal blooms could be prevented by a reduced density of planktivorous fish, which allowed development of dense cladoceran populations. The cladocerans limited the growth of precursory blooms of diatoms and green algae, and given the resulting clear-water conditions, buoyancy of A.

In order to study with accuracy this lake functioning, a one-dimensional vertical model (Licorne 2 model) was developed. This model takes into account physical, chemical and biological interactions and simulates the algal succession of the five main phytoplankton algae for two different years (1984 and 1985).
                  It appears that the growth rate, the sedimentation rate, or the death rate do not explain by themselves the algal succession, and more specially the blue-green blooms.
                  However, a good correlation between field data and Licorne 2 results are obtained by introducing specific advantages of blue-green algae such as buoyancy regulation mechanisms, capacity to fix atmospheric nitrogen and to grow at high pH value and toxin production.
                  In the view of these results, a new understanding of the Aydat lake algal succession is then possible, where competition for light, food and limitation of the losses (sedimentation, grazing) take an important place in a thermal and chemical vertical stratified environment.",,,Water Science & Technology,,IWA Publishing,"0273-1223, 1996-9732",,1995-08-01,1995,,1995-08-01,32,4,117-127,Closed,Article,"Lafforgue, Michel; Szeligiewicz, Wojciech; Devaux, Jean; Poulin, Michel","Lafforgue, Michel (SAFEGE, Parc de l'Ile, 15/27, rue du Port, B.

(Polychaeta, Ampharetidae) from mammal bones: Reproductive biology and population structure","Sunken whale carcasses, known as “whale falls”, deliver large, but relatively ephemeral pulses of organic material to the seafloor and serve as habitat for unique assemblages of deep-sea fauna that include generalist-scavenging species, chemosynthetic fauna and bone-specialist species. Despite the great deal of interest that fauna associated with whale falls have attracted, very little is known about this fauna in the deep Atlantic Ocean. Here we describe a new species of Ampharetidae that was found in an experiment using cow carcasses in the Setúbal Canyon (NE Atlantic), as a surrogate of a whale fall. Further, we analyse the size and structure of the population at two different times and use histological analyses to investigate the reproductive biology of this new species. We propose that Paramytha ossicola sp. nov. is a bone-specialist adapted for life in ephemeral habitats. Reproductive traits include rapid maturation, continuous and non-synchronous gametogenesis. Recruitment seems to be controlled by habitat availability and biological interactions that result in post-settlement mortality.","Thanks are due to the scientific parties, officers and crews of the research vessels NRP Almirante Gago Coutinho and RV Belgica (cruise 2013/17), as well as to the ROV teams (Luso, Estrutura de Missão para a Extensão da Plataforma Continental, and Genesis, Flanders Marine Institute, Ghent University) that allowed the deployment and recovery of the experiments.

There was a marked fluctuation in growth, with lowest rates in late autumn and winter. The isopod population of the beach exposed to the highest degree of anthropogenic erosion had the lowest and most stable values of abundance and biomass, the highest mortality rate and the shortest life span. Temporal fluctuations of the allometric coefficient of the length-dry weight relationship indicated a cycling pattern, with lowest values during the autumn-winter period and peak values in the summer.

We investigated the factors affecting microhabitat selection by alpine invertebrates in a system of rock slab pavement on the Rock and Pillar Range, Central Otago, New Zealand. We found fewer individuals of most groups under the 379 rocks re-examined during the winter. Logistic regression was used to model the presence of the cockroach Celatoblatta quinquemaculata (Dictyoptera: Blattidae); the alpine weta Hemideina maori (Orthoptera: Anostostomatidae); and the spider Neoramia childi (Aranea: Agelenidae). We found that rock refuge size and season were extremely important in determining presence of all of these species, and that both abiotic and biotic aspects of rock microhabitat were necessary to describe occupancy. We also found clear evidence of biological interactions between the three species modelled.

We analyzed a global compendium of fossil planktic foraminifera from the early Cretaceous to the present after correcting for temporal differences in sampling effort. Our results show that their morphological diversity has increased exponentially through time in two different phases. The first phase collapsed at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary transition. The second phase developed through the Cenozoic era and declined during the Pliocene–Pleistocene interval, a period of time that was dominated by enhanced climatic and oceanographic instability. In none of these phases diversity reached an equilibrium level. Cenozoic faunas evolved faster than those inhabiting Cretaceous oceans, perhaps as a result of a higher environmental variability. Our results indicate that planktic foraminifera conform to an exponential diversification model. However, because catastrophic events have repeatedly reset the level of biological diversity and have kept it below the maximum, we cannot confirm whether the level of diversity is potentially unlimited.","The authors thank Eustoquio Molina, Guillermo Frances, Frans Jorissen and two anonymous reviewers for comments on the manuscript.

In Lake Apopka, greatest phytoplankton biomass reflects wind‐induced resuspension of algae (meroplankton) that exists on the aphotic lake bottom in a layer approximately 5 cm thick; this assemblage is dominated by diatoms (>60% of total biomass) that can occur in resting stages. Once exposed to moderate light, meroplankton are capable of growth and photosynthetic rates comparable with surface populations. In Lake Okeechobee, remote sensing was used to assess the basin‐wide distribution of suspended particles. Satellite reflectance values agreed well with in situ particle densities at 20 in‐lake stations (average r2; LANDSAT = 0.81, AVHRR = 0.53), and maps of algal blooms (r2 = 0.79, p ≤ 0.01).

In the present study, the spatial distribution of caddisfly assemblages and coexistence patterns of larval caddisfly species (Insecta: Trichoptera) were measured in a Hungarian stream reach at three different spatial scales. Caddisfly assemblages showed aggregated, random and regular distributions as measured by the variance‐mean relationship of species richness as sampling area increased from 0.0225 m2 to 0.2025 m2. The observed coexistence patterns indicated interactions (lower diversity of unique species combinations than expected by chance) among species for aggregated distributions. These interactions among species proved to be positive associations particularly among species belonging to the same functional feeding group. The positive associations and the aggregated distribution of caddisflies supported the hypothesis that microhabitat patches (patchy microhabitat‐macroinvertebrate model) and/or positive biological interactions among species using the same resource (hypothesis of facilitation) have a deterministic effect on the spatial distribution of caddisfly assemblages.

A total of 144,531 specimens were counted and 313 taxa were identified from 3,768 photographs at 55 stations, which represented approximately 3,304 m2 of seafloor. The stations were classified into six groups according to their inventory of taxa although they represented rather a gradient from a rich and diverse suspension feeder assemblage to a poorer assemblage. In the latter, the proportion of deposit feeders was higher than in the former. A statistical comparison between biological and physical data showed that the faunistic pattern could best be explained by a combination of water depth and a geographical gradient.

This model takes into account physical, chemical and biological interactions and simulates the algal succession of the five main phytoplankton algae for two different years (1984 and 1985).It appears that the growth rate, the sedimentation rate, or the death rate do not explain by themselves the algal succession, and more specially the blue-green blooms.However, a good correlation between field data and Licorne 2 results are obtained by introducing specific advantages of blue-green algae such as buoyancy regulation mechanisms, capacity to fix atmospheric nitrogen and to grow at high pH value and toxin production.In the view of these results, a new understanding of the Aydat lake algal succession is then possible, where competition for light. food and limitation of the losses (sedimentation, grazing) take an important place in a thermal and chemical vertical stratified environment.",,,Water Science & Technology,,IWA Publishing,"0273-1223, 1996-9732",,1995,1995,,1995,32,4,117-127,Closed,Article,"Lafforgue, Michel; Szeligiewicz, Wojciech; Devaux, Jean; Poulint, Michel","Lafforgue, Michel (SAFEGE Parc de l'lle, 15/27, rue du Port, B.

The model represents reproduction, growth, and interspecific competition by coral colonies in terms of “ownership” of space in a plot of reef habitat. Using data for several eastern Pacific coral species, the model reproduces observed changes in species composition and diversity during coral community development. Model results suggest that during early successional stages, or in areas that are frequently disturbed, larval colonization and rapid growth are more important than dominance achieved by extracoelenteric digestion or by growing over another coral in acquiring and maintaining possession of reef substrate. In mature communities that remain undisturbed, dominance is the best competitive strategy.

In contrast to plant species richness and production, however, little is known on the relevance of biological interactions between plants, invertebrate herbivores, and fungal pathogens for grasslands in the Alps. At the time when the vegetation was fully developed, but prior to agricultural use, we examined whether leaf damage by herbivory and fungal pathogen infection, and their diversity, are affected by plant functional group, land use, and altitude. Moreover, we studied whether extent and diversity of leaf damage are related to each other, to plant species richness, and to standing crop. We recorded the leaf area damaged by ten types of herbivory and five types of fungal pathogen infection on 12,054 plant leaves of legumes, other forbs, and graminoids collected in 215 grassland parcels in 12 valleys in the Swiss Alps. With 83 % of all leaves infested, herbivory and fungal pathogen infection were omnipresent. However, only 2.7 % leaf area was damaged by herbivory and 1.2 % by fungal pathogens. Damage by herbivory was highest on legumes, and damage by fungal pathogens was highest on graminoids. More leaf damage by herbivory occurred in traditionally mown sites and at lower altitudes, while damage by fungal pathogen infection was independent of land use and altitude. Most types of herbivory were found on legumes and on leaves from fertilised sites, whereas the number of fungal pathogen types was highest on graminoids and in unfertilised sites. Larger standing crop was associated with higher leaf damage and diversity of herbivory types per leaf. Neither damage by herbivory nor by fungal pathogens was correlated with plant species diversity. In more plant species rich parcels, the number of herbivory types was lower at the leaf level, but tended to be higher at the parcel level. Our results highlight the omnipresence of plant–herbivore and plant–pathogen interactions. They suggest that current land use changes from mowing to grazing or to abandonment decrease the diversity of herbivory, and that fertilisation decreases pathogen diversity. As our results did not reveal conservation conflicts between diversities of plants, herbivores, and fungal pathogens, and as the damage from herbivory and pathogens is generally low, we conclude that for protecting the high diversity of plant–herbivore and plant–pathogen interactions a diverse low-intensity land use should be maintained.","We thank V.

641,pub.1040376016,10.3739/rikusui.61.65,,,,Climatic warming and lake plankton communities,"Studies on the effects of climatic warming on lake plankton communities are reviewed, and the effects on lake ecosystem structure and functioning are discussed. Such warming reduces dissolved oxygen concentration in the hypolimnion and enhances the dominance of cyanobacteria in the phytoplankton community. Thus, its effects resemble those of eutrophication. Increased water temperature due to climatic warming reduces high-temperature-sensitive species such as mysids an Daphnia. Warmwater fishes increase their habitats while coolwater fishes decrease them in the process of climatic warming, thus changing the community structure and distribution of zooplankton. Furthermore, climatic warming may change a plankton community by controlling various biological interactions such as competition and predator-prey relationships, and reduce species diversity in the community. It is expected that the climatic warming enhances the contamination from toxic chemicals and increases UV penetration in lakes. Therefore, climatic warming promotes the delete-rious effects of existing environmental stresses on lake ecosystems. It is hypothesized that the fol-lowing two phenomena characterize the structural and functional responses of lake ecosystems to climatic warming: (1) reduction in the average size of organisms, and (2) a reduction in energy transfer efficiency from primary producers to top predators.",,,Japanese Journal of Limnology (Rikusuigaku Zasshi),,The Japanese Society of Limnology,"1882-4897, 0021-5104",,2000,2000,,2000,61,1,65,All OA; Bronze,Article,"HANAZATO, Takayuki","HANAZATO, Takayuki ()",,"HANAZATO, Takayuki ()",,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,0.07,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/rikusui1931/61/1/61_1_65/_pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1040376016,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 41 Environmental Sciences,,,,,,A05 Biological Sciences,

Using a stepwise regression procedure, we tested the effects of nonlagged population density (log10 Nt‐1), lagged population density (log10 Nt‐2), and annual precipitation on the per capita rate of population change of Phyllotis darwini, Akodon olivaceus, and Thylamys elegans in two habitat types of a semiarid region of Chile. The most irruptive species (P. darwini) showed direct and delayed density‐dependent effects in equatorial subpopulation, and only direct density‐dependence in polar subpopulation. The per capita rates of population change of A. olivaceus showed direct density‐dependent and precipitation effects in both habitats types, while T. elegans showed direct density‐dependence and precipitation effects in the equatorial subpopulation but only a marginal effect of direct density‐dependence in the polar subpopulation.

In the current ecological crisis, there is a need to better understand the conditions of coexistence between predators, prey and their resources. The body size is considered a key feature to explain community-scale phenomena, energetic, and evolutionary constraints. This raises the question of how species body size directly or indirectly affects the demographic patterns that enable coexistence. Considering the above, we conducted a theoretical study that implements a Rosenzweig-MacArthur type model, which represents a three-level chain that integrates body sizes and includes a Holling type I functional response. In this model, we characterize coexistence through body size-dependent net reproductive rates. Our results suggest that the body sizes of consumer species strongly affect the size-density relations and energy requirements. We obtain the negative relationship between body size and density of intermediate consumers and discuss the energy equivalence rule. Furthermore, larger predators have a more significant impact on the intensity of the trophic cascade than smaller predators.

We examined the spatiotemporal interplay of stream temperature, geomorphic features, and a species’ thermal sensitivity mediated by biological interactions in a case study of steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in California’s Eel River watershed. We estimated habitat suitability and fish capacity for each salmonid run and freshwater life stage during average, cool, and warm years in each of the watershed’s subbasins, including a historically occupied high-elevation subbasin upstream of an impassable dam. Our estimates varied depending on whether we accounted for exposure to the Sacramento pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus grandis), an introduced predator and competitor. Our results indicate that the dammed subbasin has substantial salmonid capacity relative to the rest of the watershed and could provide an important cool-water refuge during warm years and from pikeminnow, potentially improving the productivity and resilience of multiple anadromous salmonid populations. Our approach can be applied in any setting where spatially explicit habitat metrics can be estimated and population-specific and life-stage-specific habitat criteria can be specified.",Funding for this project was provided by NOAA Fisheries West Coast Region California Coastal Office and NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center.

The phenomenon of spontaneous pattern generation even in a homogeneous environment through the interplay of reaction and movement is a very general property of the class of mathematical ‘reaction–diffusion’ equations used to model such systems, and there are several ways in which such patterns may occur. The result may be either spatiotemporal patterns1 or time-independent spatial patterns. Usually one thinks of diffusion as damping inhomogeneities, and a hypothesis put forward by Steele2 essentially relies on a balance reached between the dehomogenising aspects of local interaction and the homogenising influence of diffusion to produce pattern. On the other hand, it has also been suggested3–6 that in some conditions diffusion can destabilise an otherwise stable interaction (in the manner originally suggested by Turing7) to produce pattern. We have explored5 this further in a nonlinear analysis that describes the final stages of pattern formation, and the resultant calculations provide some insights into the spatial scale of patterns which might arise in this way.",,,Nature,,Springer Nature,"0028-0836, 1476-4687",,1976-02,1976,,1976-02,259,5545,659-659,All OA; Bronze,Article,"LEVIN, SIMON A.; SEGEL, LEE A.","LEVIN, SIMON A.

How strong biological interactions such as the host–parasite arms-race are modulated by environmental change is largely unknown. The immune system of invertebrates, in particular phagocytosis and phenoloxidase activity response are key defence mechanisms against parasites, yet they may be sensitive to environmental perturbations. We here simulated an extreme event that mimicked the European heat wave in 2003 to investigate the effect of environmental change on the immunocompetence of the mesograzer Idotea baltica. Unlike earlier studies, our experiment aimed at simulation of the natural situation as closely as possible by using long acclimation, a slow increase in temperature and a natural community setting including the animals’ providence with natural food sources (Zostera marina and Fucus vesiculosus). Our results demonstrate that a simulated heat wave results in decreased immunocompetence of the mesograzer Idotea baltica, in particular a drop of phagocytosis by 50%. This suggests that global change has the potential to significantly affect host–parasite interactions.","We want to thank Günter Hoch from the University of Basel for analysing leaf content.

(ii) If physical variables determine regional ecosystem properties, then independent clusters of observations of physical, biological and interaction variables from the same stations will show similar patterns. We use the leading–lagging-strength method to establish leading strength and potential causality, and we use principal component analysis, to establish if regions differ in their ecological characteristics. We found that several relationships for physical and chemical variables were significant, and consistent with “common knowledge” of causal relations.

We investigated the role of an inducible defense as a factor that influences the trophic pathway in an aquatic food web. Quantitative information on food web structure in Lake Suwa (a eutrophic lake in Japan) was provided by carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses using samples taken during summer and a structural equation model applied to annual monitoring data. As predicted, there was none or only a weak link detected between the prey with induced defenses (Bosmina fatalis) and its invertebrate predator (Leptodora kindtii). The effects of an inducible defense on the trophic links are based mainly on the mortality or population growth rate of organisms using predation, population (or community) level experiments, field data, and model estimates. However, there was no research linking these different data using stable isotope analyses.

Three local pollen assemblage zones are described: a Betula–Populus–Juniperus zone from 10 500 to 9000 years BP, a Picea–Betula zone from 9000 to 5100 years BP, and a Picea–Betula–Alnus zone from 5100 years BP to the present. The earliest vegetation recorded at this site is a mosaic of poplar groves, juniper and Shepherdia shrub, and fragmentary patches of tundra, replaced rapidly by spruce woodland at roughly 8500 years BP, dominated initially by Picea glauca.

Dominant species $(>1\%$ of the total number of amphipods) consist of 5 gammarids (Gammaropsis japonicus, Jassa slatteryi, Pontogenia rostrata, Atylus collingi and Ceinina japonica) and 1 caprellid (Caprella tsugarensis). Mean densities of amphipods varied from the highest of in-May to the lowest of in September. G. japonicus and J. slatteryi dominated in summer whereas C. japonica in autumn and winter. C. japonica was found to be a carnivorous feeder consuming mainly harpacticoid copepods and unidentified crustaceans, whereas G. japonicus, J. slatteryi, and C. tsugarensis consumed both phytoplankton and detritus. Seasonal densities of amphipods were significantly related with the shoot standing crop of the eelgrass and its epiphyte. Also densities of amphipods displayed significant difference in related with the shoot density of the eelgrass among sampling stations.

Euplotes vannus, a hypotrich ciliate. grows well over broad ranges of temperature and salinity. It requires higher densities of food (> 1 × 104 cells/ml) for rapid reproduction than do the other herbivores, the foraminiferan Al‐logromia laticollaris (> 1 × 102 cells/ml), and the nematode Chromadorina germanica (∼ 1 × 103 cells/ml), to which it was compared. If food levels were initially very high (∼ 1 × 108 cells/ml) the ciliates reproduced rapidly and consumed the algae faster than it could reproduce. Some balance between the algae and the ciliates was achieved at initial algal concentrations of ∼ 1 × 105 cells/ml. In microcosm experiments at 25 C with equal numbers of C. germanica and A. laticollaris. E. vannus proved to be a very poor competitor; reaching only 20% of control levels when grow with C. germanica and only 13% when cultured with A. laticollaris. It was a better competitor in 2‐species microcosms, at lower temperatures, and when its ratio to the other species was initially higher.

The intensity of their effects was considered dependent on the duration of their residence and their activity levels in forests. Field surveys and experimental studies showed that both plants and soils beneath colonies and roosts are affected by the deposition of feces, and damage to twigs and foliage (caused by flapping and trampling, and by collection for nest materials). These activities may change the interactions among plants and between plants and soil, and may affect the community structure of soil animals and fungi. This change of the interactions among biological/chemical and physical factors resulted in the changes of the succession of the plant communities. The mechanism causing the decline and death of plants, the succession of forest vegetation, the dynamics of plant community structure and biological interactions in the cormorant colonies and roosts are still unclear.

Nest predation is the primary source of reproductive failure for passerine birds and can change in response to temperature. However, it is unclear which predator species are responsible for such patterns because predation events are rarely observed. We investigated whether temperature influenced predator-specific rates of nest predation by analyzing data from six prior studies conducted between 1997 and 2010 in Texas, Illinois, and Missouri that used constant-surveillance video systems to identify predators at the nests of Golden-cheeked Warblers (Setophaga chrysoparia), Blackcapped Vireos (Vireo atricapilla), Indigo Buntings (Passerina cyanea), and Acadian Flycatchers (Empidonax virescens). Rates of nest predation by snakes and birds increased as daily maximum temperatures increased, whereas predation by mammals was essentially invariant in response to temperature. The relative roles of physiological versus community-level mechanisms (e.g., abundance or behavior of predators and/or alternative prey) in driving the patterns we observed remain unclear, but our data point to the need to consider important biological interactions when forecasting the effects of climate change on songbird populations.","We thank the original principal investigators and their field technicians for their tireless efforts in the field.

Conclusions about the herbivore population are drawn from statistical parameter values and presence/absence in the most parsimonious model. However, this procedure is only reliable if the statistical parameters have general interpretations regardless of system characteristics. Here we investigated the extent to which this is true by deriving six different vegetation–herbivore‐systems and analyzing their respective statistical parameters. The analysis was done in both continuous and discrete time. It turned out that both density parameters (a1 and a2) and rainfall coefficients change with biological interactions and amount of average rainfall, and they do so in different ways in different systems. This means that there is no valid general interpretation of them and, most important, the probability of detecting density dependence and effects of rainfall vary between systems.

While there are reliable ways to characterize specificity at individual and community levels, the evaluation of population and species‐level measures is lacking. There is a need for such assessments given that populations and species are the relevant scales for most ecological and evolutionary processes. 2. Using examples of simulated and empirical data sets of bipartite networks representing a continuum of biological interactions, we evaluate six indices of specificity in terms of their robustness to incomplete sampling and information they extract from data. 3. Robustness differed between the measures and in their ability to differentiate specialists and generalists along a full continuum. On the empirical data sets, indices were less separated by their informativity than on the simulated data sets, which may be due to the heterogeneity of the former. 4. Based on these different evaluations for species‐level (or population‐level) specificity, we recommend the use of Resource range when no quantitative data are available and Paired Difference Index otherwise. These results will assist both applied and fundamental researchers in the characterization and interpretation of species specificity.","We thank J.D. Bever, S. Gandon, S. Kéfi and P.H.

The course of colonization is described, and some data are presented on autecology, reporduction, and growth rate of particular species. About three months after initial settlement, conditions of coexistence in a mixed barnacle-ascidian community began to change increasingly due to heavy competition for space. The colonial speciesBotryllus schlosseri proved to be potentially dominant. Shortly before it attained monopolization by replacing barnacles (mainlyElminius modestus), a major physical disturbance eliminated the fast growing ascidian. The roles of physical factors, of biological interactions, and of historical events in community development are discussed in context with succession theory and other concepts evolved more recently. It is concluded that succession-like processes can occur in subtidal fouling communities, but there the existence of a globally stable climax is unlikely.

We examined skeletobionts on brachiopod hosts from a stratigraphic section in western New York State that spanned the Lower Kellwasser and Upper Kellwasser events, the two pulses of the Frasnian–Famennian (Late Devonian) mass extinction. The fossils are largely preserved as molds, and even endoskeletobiont borings are often visible with minimal preparation. At least seven major groups of skeletobiont are present including microconchids, stenolaemate and ctenostome bryozoans, hederelloids, and various borings attributed to sponges. The total frequency of skeletobiosis declined significantly across the first extinction pulse (Lower Kellwasser Event), and relative abundance patterns shifted, although the biotic and/or abiotic drivers of these changes require further study. Multivariable logistic regression indicates that large host body size was a strong and consistent predictor of skeletobiosis. Endoskeletobionts were more common in coarser lithologies, reflecting either an ecological preference for sands over muds or a bias against preservation in mudstones.

Alterations in their chemical and physical characteristics may directly affect their biological activities, compromising ecosystem functioning and the provisioning of ecosystem services that depend on biodiversity. In the last five decades, agriculture expansion and agrochemical utilization have increased following food demand. The trend is anticipated to continue due to factors like population growth, the emergence of new pests, and the use of biofuels. The increasing application of agrochemicals is an emerging threat to aquatic ecosystems due to their constant entry into water bodies and their high toxicity. Here, we present a brief synthesis of the effects of agrochemicals in freshwater systems, mainly their impacts on an important biological component of aquatic biota, the macroinvertebrates.

Introduced species differ markedly in their capacity to invade, and only one, Paramecium, invades all of the communities. Most of the introduced species invade some communities, and there is a large introduction×community interaction that comes about from bringing together particular combinations of species. For example, the rate of increase of Amoeba is greater when introduced into communities containing Paramecium than when introduced into communities in which Paramecium is absent. The omnivore Blepharisma increases faster in the presence of one of its prey Tetrahymena, notwithstanding the fact that it is also a potential competitor with this prey for bacteria.

We describe the establishment of a system for long-term laboratory maintenance of the host-parasite interaction, and provide information on the larval biology of the species, including duration of larval stages, brood release intervals, sizes of male and female cypris larvae (cyprids), and changes in the ratio of cyprids among broods. Sacculina yatsui mainly settles on the thin and flexible arthrodial membranes of the chelipeds, maxillipeds, and pereiopods of the host. Preliminary analysis of transcriptome in the nauplii of the parasite indicated that four out of the top ten most highly expressed transcripts are related to the formation of the chitinous cuticle. Our results will provide a useful basis for subsequent transcriptomic studies to address the molecular mechanisms underlying larval biology and the biological interactions between rhizocephalans and their hosts.",KO and YHW were funded by a President Special Project grant from Akita Prefectural University.

Few studies have assessed the importance of biological interactions in structuring these communities. In the present study, benthic diatom community structure in relation to manipulated food webs was assessed using in situ mesocosms, whereby predator‐free environments and environments comprising two different fish species were assessed. Zooplankton abundance, settled algal biomass and the diatom community were monitored over a 12‐day period across each of the three trophic scenarios. Differences among treatments over time were observed in zooplankton abundances, particularly copepods. Similarly, the benthic diatom community structure changed significantly over time across the three trophic treatments. However, no differences in total algal biomass were found among treatments. This was likely the result of non‐diatom phytoplankton contributions. We propose that the benthic diatom community structure within the mesocosms was influenced by trophic cascades and potentially through direct consumption by the fish. The study highlights that not only are organisms at the base of the food web affected by predators at the top of the food web, but that predator identity is potentially an important consideration for predator–prey interaction outcomes with consequences for multiple trophic levels.","This work was supported by the Science Focus Grant, Rhodes University.

In this study, we examined the ability of pH and several water chemistry covariables to explain temporal changes in the littoral benthic macroinvertebrate communities of lakes recovering from acidification. Data from 17 lakes sampled from 1988 to 2002 were summarized using correspondence analysis and compared using Procrustes analysis. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to examine the relationship between chemical variables and community structure. Benthic community composition changed over the sampling period, with significant year-to-year changes from 1993 to 1998. Community composition and water chemistry were highly correlated throughout the study period, although the strongest correlations were found from 1993 to 1997, coinciding with the period of greatest change in the benthic community.

Temporal patterns were analysed to assess the effects of hydrological conditions on zooplankton community structure and the differential response of the two major zooplankton taxa, rotifers and crustaceans. 2. Calculated floodplain water age was used as an integrated parameter describing hydrological conditions and connectivity. 3. Total zooplankton biomass, crustacean biomass and crustacean species number were significantly positively related to water age. Rotifer biomass followed a hump‐shaped relationship with water age, and rotifer species number decreased with increasing water age. 4. Rotifers dominated the community in periods of low to medium water ages. In periods of higher water ages the community was dominated by crustaceans. 5. We propose that the hydrological regime of floodplains is crucial for zooplankton biomass patterns and succession, through the alternation of washing‐out effects, taxon‐specific potential of reproduction and biological interactions.

During recruitment, physical interactions are common, with recruits settling on loose substrates likely to be abraded during storm events, while incidental grazing and predation on exposed surfaces may also inflict damage. Nevertheless, larvae have been observed to recruit and survive on substrates where physical damage is likely, possibly owing to their regenerative capacity. Here, we present the first visual time-series evidence of recruit regeneration following physical damage. To investigate regeneration of these recruits, we sliced and removed tissue from individual Acropora millepora coral recruits and tracked their recovery through survivorship and linear growth. Coral recruits were very robust to slicing, even if the mouth-stomodeum was damaged, which does not support the previously held view that damage to this area is terminal. While section removal did show some evidence of damage at later stages, recruits were more robust to damage than expected which may assist their survival in dynamic habitats.","This project was supported through government appropriation funding (Australian Institute of Marine Science).

Here, we manipulate seagrass cover in the field to identify the short-term and local effects of the loss of Zostera marina (eelgrass) on the physical conditions under the canopy and on the size distribution and mortality of a common bivalve, the scallop Argopecten circularis. Compared to intact eelgrass (100% cover), plots with 50% cover or no cover (100% bare sediment) experienced significant increases of average daily light and temperature. Changes in scallop relative mortality were associated to the reduction in eelgrass cover, while the decrease in scallop size was associated to changes in light and temperature after eelgrass trimming. These results emphasize the importance of seagrass cover for mediating the environmental conditions under the canopy and potentially modulating biological interactions of associated invertebrates.","CONACYT is acknowledged for the MS scholarship to AGO.

                  Structure and diversity of sessile zoobenthic assemblages seem to be driven not only by chemical-physical constraints and biological interactions but also by substrate lithology and its surface features. Nevertheless, broadly distributed crustose epilithic corallines could mask the role of substrate on animal settling. To evaluate the direct influence of different rocky substrates, occurrence and coverage of several sessile species, growing on the dark (i.e. coralline-free) face of sublittoral limestone and granite boulders were compared in the Tavolara MPA (Mediterranean Sea). The analysis of photographic samples demonstrated significant differences in terms of species composition and coverage, according to lithology. Moreover, limestone boulders were widely bare, while the cover per cent was almost total on granite. The leading cause of observed patterns could be the different level of dissolution of the two types of rocks, due to their different mineral composition and textural characteristics. Limestone has previously been shown to have higher dissolution compared with granite, and consequently, a more unstable surface. Our results suggest that, in dark habitats, the absence of the crustose coralline layer allows more rock dissolution and consequent lower stability of the limestone compared with granite, which, in turn, reduces the zoobenthos colonization.",We thank the Tavolara Marine Protected Area staff for their permission to undertake sampling and the section of Lega Navale Italiana of Loiri Porto San Paolo for the logistical support during sampling activity.,,Marine Biodiversity Records,,Cambridge University Press (CUP),"0025-3154, 1755-2672, 1469-7769",,2020-09-11,2020,2020-09-11,2020-09,100,6,879-888,All OA; Gold,Article,"Canessa, M.; Bavestrello, G.; Trainito, E.; Navone, A.; Cattaneo-Vietti, R.","Canessa, M.

Investigations of palaeontological evidence for predator–prey interactions have been popular pursuits, and a number of attractive hypotheses have been proposed which link increased predation pressure with a wide range of morphological and ecological changes which are apparent over the course of the Phanerozoic. In particular studies of fossil drill holes and repair scars in shelly prey have been common targets for research. However, the nature of some of our data has been rather anecdotal and restricted in range. Perhaps we should be more concerned that we are not picking up the true range of natural variability. This paper aims to highlight the sources of variability in our data and, going forward, to urge the collection of quantitative data from many more samples and (palaeo)environmental settings in order that we might properly be able to separate the intrinsic natural variability in our data from robust temporal or spatial trends.",I was very grateful for the invitation to give a talk in the Biotic Interactions symposium at the 2015 Annual Conference of the Palaeontological Association in Cardiff and especially to Caroline Buttler for her encouragement.

The present study analyses mitochondrial DNA sequences and allozyme variation to investigate species diversity in 176 Daphnia populations from Argentina. This work established the presence of at least 15 species in Argentina, six of which are either undescribed or are currently misidentified and two of which represent range extensions of North American taxa. Eleven of the Argentine species appear endemic to South America, while the remaining four also occur in North America. In the latter cases, the close genetic similarity between populations from North and South America indicates the recent exchange of propagules between the continents. While biological interactions and habitat availability have undoubtedly contributed to the observed species distributions, chance dispersal has apparently played a dominant role in structuring large‐scale biogeographical patterns in this genus and probably in other passively‐dispersed organisms. © 2004 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2004, 140, 171−205.",,,Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society,,Oxford University Press (OUP),"0024-4082, 1096-3642",,2004-02-01,2004,2004-02-03,2004-02-01,140,2,171-205,All OA; Green,Article,"ADAMOWICZ, SARAH J.; HEBERT, PAUL D.

Herein, we review evidence that such approaches would benefit our understanding of fish recruitment in large freshwater lakes, which exhibit similar physical processes and contain fishes with comparable life-history characteristics as marine ecosystems. A review of the primary literature (1965–2008) for freshwater and marine ecosystems revealed that coupled biophysical research on fish ELS (i) has benefited our ability to understand and predict fish recruitment in marine ecosystems; (ii) has been virtually absent from small lake ecosystems but has been growing in the Laurentian Great Lakes; and (iii) has shown that similar to marine ecosystems, physical processes can control fish recruitment in large lakes through direct and indirect pathways, often involving interactions between biological processes and physicochemical conditions. In addition to identifying specific research gaps and opportunities, this perspective points to the need for increased research on physical–biological coupling in large lake ecosystems, as well as the continued erosion of barriers between marine and freshwater fisheries recruitment science.","We thank C.

Silva within and below its normal range in the intertidal zone of central California. A combination of competitor removal, grazer exclusion and transplant manipulations showed that within the I. flaccida zone, this alga can be the first macroscopic plant to become reestablished after clearing and that this can occur in less than two months. Grazing by molluscs within this zone retards, but does not prevent, re‐establishment. Although absent prior to the experiments, both I. flaccida and I. cordata (Turn.) Bory settled, grew rapidly and reproduced in cleared areas below the I. flaccida zone, regardless of the presence of grazers. These plants did not establish themselves if entire thalli or holdfasts of other algae normally occupying the lower zone were present. The results support the few other in situ experimental investigations of algal zonation by showing that, when bounded by other plants, the lower limits of intertidal algae are directly determined by competition.

Based on a compilation of literature sources and surveys of paleontological collections of the Florida Museum of Natural History and the National Museum of Natural History, we provide a tentative evaluation of the post‐Palaeozoic history of drilling predation on the organophosphatic brachiopods of the family Lingulidae. Despite temporal, geographical and methodological limitations of the data assembled here, the results indicate that lingulide brachiopods have been subject to drilling predation since at least the Eocene. Variation in drilling frequencies at the locality level suggests that lingulides may occasionally experience somewhat elevated predation pressures from drilling organisms. Overall, however, drilling predation on lingulide brachiopods has been infrequent in the Cenozoic and may have been absent in the Mesozoic. The Mesozoic‐to‐Cenozoic increase in drilling frequencies on lingulides is similar to the trends observed in other marine benthic invertebrates and consistent with the hypothesis that predation pressures increased through time in marine ecosystems.","We thank Sean Roberts (Division of Invertebrate Paleontology, Florida Museum of Natural History) for assistance with digital images, Mark Florence (Department of Paleobiology, National Museum of Natural History) for the digital images of the type material and Alfréd Dulai (Department of Palaeontology and Geology, Hungarian Natural History Museum) for sharing useful information from his ongoing research.

Most of these studies have focused on predicting changes in distribution of fishes based on their thermal-physiological data and on predicting population dynamics using species-specific bioenergetic models. However, in reality, the effects of global warming on freshwater fishes should not be predicted without considering the complex interactions with local environmental disturbance factors. In addition, in many cases, previous studies have failed to look at changes in genetic struc-ture of populations, life history plasticity, and biological interactions such as predator-prey and interspecific competition in their predictions. These resulted in our not having been able to precisely make reliable predictions of effects of global warming on freshwater fishes. Also, although extinc-tion and changes in distribution of the fishes should influence food web and biogeochemical cycling, few such studies have been attempted yet. Future researches should include attempts to accumulate field observational data and to elucidate potential mechanisms of the effects of global warming on the freshwater fishes in the context of multidisciplinary cooperative studies.",,,Japanese Journal of Limnology (Rikusuigaku Zasshi),,The Japanese Society of Limnology,"0021-5104, 1882-4897",,2000,2000,,2000,61,1,79,All OA; Bronze,Article,"TANIGUCHI, Yoshinori; NAKANO, Shigeru","TANIGUCHI, Yoshinori (); NAKANO, Shigeru ()",,"TANIGUCHI, Yoshinori (); NAKANO, Shigeru ()",,,,,,,,,,,4,0,,0.29,1,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/rikusui1931/61/1/61_1_79/_pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1011647523,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,

As a result, we have very limited knowledge on species׳ behaviour and interactions in these communities and how they in turn influence community dynamics. Interactions such as competition or predation significantly affect community structure in vent communities, and video time-series have successfully been used to gain insights in biological interactions and species behaviour, including responses to short-term changes in temperature or feeding strategies. In this study, we combined in situ and ex situ approaches to characterise the behaviour and interactions among two key species encountered along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR): the shrimp Mirocaris fortunata and the crab Segonzacia mesatlantica. In situ, species small-scale distribution, interactions and behaviour were studied using the TEMPO observatory module deployed on the seafloor at the base of the active Eiffel Tower edifice in the Lucky Strike vent field as part of the EMSO-Açores MoMAR observatory. TEMPO sampled 2min of video four times a day from July 2011 to April 2012. One week of observations per month was used for ‘long-term’ variations, and a full video data set was analysed for January 2012. In addition, observations of crab and shrimp individuals maintained for the first time under controlled conditions in atmospheric pressure (classic tank) and pressurised (AbyssBox) aquaria allowed better characterisation and description of the different types of behaviour and interactions observed in nature. While the identified in situ spatial distribution pattern was stable over the nine months, both species displayed a significant preference for mussel bed and anhydrite substrata, and preferentially occupied the area located directly in the fluid flow axis. The aggregation behaviour of M. fortunata resulted in the occurrence of numerous intraspecific interactions mainly involving the use of two pairs of sensory organs (antenna/antennule) and fleeing behaviours when in contact or close to individuals of S. mesatlantica. The higher level of passiveness observed in the ex situ artificial environment compared to the in situ environment was attributed to the lack of stimulation related to low densities of congeners and/or of sympatric species compared to the natural environment and the absence of continuous food supply, as both species displayed a significant higher level of activity during feeding time. This result emphasises the role of food supply as a driver of species distribution and behaviour. Direct in situ observations using cameras deployed on deep-sea observatories, combined with experimental set-up in pressurised aquaria, will help investigators understand the factors influencing community dynamics and species biology at vents as well as their underlying mechanisms.","We thank the captain and crews of the R/V Pourquoi pas? as well as the pilots of the ROV Victor6000 for their assistance and support during the MoMARSAT cruises.

Pollinators were attracted to the larger inflorescences in sparse populations, which were also more visible due to their larger area for a given size. 3 Bumblebees probed more flowers within plants in sparse populations, probably due to the larger inflorescences and longer flight distances between individuals. 4 Subsequent reproductive success (capsule production) was higher in sparse populations, due to differences in pollination success and resource competition, and their interaction. In self‐compatible species, such as L. viscaria, reproductive success may be determined more by resource availability, whereas self‐incompatible plants may be more sensitive to changes in pollinator abundance. 5 We conclude that plant–pollinator interactions are sensitive to changes in both the size and spatial arrangement of plant populations, which can affect their demography and genetics. In this study, species density had a greater effect than size and the unexpectedly beneficial effects of low density may be due to greater resource availability.

624,pub.1052392280,10.1007/bf02365466,,,,"Biological interactions and their role in community structure in the rocky intertidal of Helgoland (German Bight, North Sea)","Over 3 successive seasonal cycles (April 1986 to October 1988), field experiments were established within 3 intertidal levels in the sheltered rocky intertidal of Helgoland (North Sea, German Bight). Competitors for space (Mytilus edulis, macroalgae), herbivores (Littorina spp.) and predators (Carcinus maenas) were either excluded from areas (0.25 m2) covered by undisturbed communities or enclosed at natural densities on areas that were cleared before of animals and plants. All the experimental fields (each 0.25 m2) were covered by cages with 4 mm gauze at the sides and a plexiglas top. The results of the experiments in the upper intertidal (occupied byLittorina spp. andEnteromorpha) showed that a natural density of herbivores could not prevent algal settlement and had only little influence on algal growth. Instead abiotic factors (storms, algae washed ashore) decreased the stock of the green algae. Experiments in the mid intertidal, dominated byMytilus (50% cover),Fucus spp. (20%) and grazingL. littorea (100 ind. m−2) showed that community structure was directly changed both by grazing periwinkles and by competition for space between mussels and macroalgae. WheneverLittorina was excluded, the canopy ofFucus spp. increased continuously and reached total cover within two years. In addition to the increase ofFucus spp., the rock surface and the mussel shells were overgrown byUlva pseudocurvata, which covered the experimental fields during parts of the summer in the absence of herbivores. As soon as perennial species (fucoids) covered most of the experimental areas, the seasonal growth ofUlva decreased drastically. Presence and growth of macroalgae were also controlled by serious competition for space with mussels. EstablishedMytilus prevented the growth of all perennial and ephemeral algae on the rocks. However, the shells of the mussels provided free space for a new settlement ofFucus andUlva. In the lower intertidal (dominated by total algal cover ofF. serratus, herbivores such asL. littorea andL. mariae, and increasing number of predators such asCarcinus), the feeding activity of herbivores can neither prevent the settlement of the fucoid sporelings nor reduce the growth of macroalgae.F. serratus achieved a total canopy on the rock within one year. Doubled density of herbivores prevented the settlement ofFucus and most of the undercover algae. Predation byCarcinus onLittorina spp. had little influence on the herbivore community patterns. However, the crabs supported the establishment of macroalgae by excluding the mussels from the lower intertidal. In summary, the community organization and maintenance in the mid and lower intertidal is influenced to a high degree by biological interactions. Whereas both the relatively important herbivory byL. littorea and competition for space between mussels and macroalgae dominate in the mid intertidal, predation reaches its highest relative degree of importance for community structure in the lower intertidal.",,,Helgoland Marine Research,,Springer Nature,"1438-387X, 1438-3888, 0174-3597",,1990-06,1990,,1990-06,44,2,219-263,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Janke, Klaus","Janke, Klaus (Biologische Anstalt Helgoland (Meeresstation), D-2192, Helgoland, FRG; Abt.

However, despite their ecological importance, the magnitude and drivers of their temporal dynamics remain largely unexplored. To address this significant knowledge gap, we performed weekly sampling over ten months in a wind-driven coastal upwelling area in the subtropical South Atlantic Ocean. We combined this intensive feldwork with multi-color fow cytometry and statistical modeling to investigate the temporal changes of both femto- and picophytoplankton at multiple temporal scales. We found that femtoplanktonic organisms (including virus-like particles) responded faster (i.e., without a temporal lag) to environmental changes, mainly related to chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and phaeopigment variations. On the other hand, picophytoplanktonic organisms showed a slower response to environmental changes, with positive responses to variation in pH and NH4 concentrations after a one-week lag. Overall, our results demonstrate that the speed of response of planktonic organisms to environmental changes may be dependent on their size, which highlights the importance of environmental variables and biological interactions as drivers of their temporal dynamics.","We are grateful to the IEAPM/Brazilian Navy and all those who have worked on the sampling and laboratory analysis, mainly the Chemical Group of IEAPM.

However, in at least some cases, biological interactions appear amenable to such extrapolation. The paleobiological literature contains examples of predation, competition, and herbivory in which the dynamics are similar on multiple spatiotemporal scales.
                  Dense populations of epifaunal, suspension-feeding ophiuroids, or brittlestar beds, are widely distributed, but they are rare and are restricted in their habitat distribution. On a small scale (meters to kilometers, hours to days), brittlestar bed distribution in the British Isles and the Bahamas is limited by predatory fishes and crabs. On an intermediate scale (tens to hundreds of kilometers, decades to centuries), predation by seastars may cause cycles of ophiuroid abundance in the western English Channel, beyond the stringent restrictions imposed by fish and crab predators. On a large scale (globally, millions to tens of millions of years), the Jurassic decline of brittlestar beds is associated with the diversification of predatory teleosts, neoselachian sharks, and decapod crustaceans.
                  Small-scale predator-ophiuroid interactions sum to produce analogous intermediate- and large-scale interactions. Predation effects on brittlestar beds appear to be scale-independent, or fractal.

Such reorganization of communities is starting to occur in a multitude of local ecosystems, implying that tropicalisation of marine communities could become a global phenomenon. Using 32 years of trawl surveys in the Bay of Somme (English Channel, France), we aimed to investigate the existence of a tropicalisation in the fish community at the local scale of the estuary during the mid-1990s, a period where an exceptional temperature rise occurred in Northeast Atlantic. A long-term response occurred (with a major transition over 6 years) that was characterized by a marked diminution in the abundance of cold-water species in parallel to a temperature rise generated by the ocean-scale phenomenon, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, which switched from a cool to a warm phase during the late 1990s. Despite finding no significant increase in the dominance of warm-water species, the long-term diminution of cold-water species suggests that the restructuring of the fish community was mainly influenced by global-scale environmental conditions rather than local ones and that indirect effects may also occurred through biological interactions.","We would especially like to acknowledge all persons involved in the NOURSOM survey since 1980 on the professional boats.

621,pub.1069664871,10.2307/1942654,,,,Meiofauna‐Macrofauna Interactions in a High Salt Marsh Habitat,"Biological interactions between meiofauna and macroepifauna were studied in a high salt marsh habitat using manipulative techniques. When macroepifauna were excluded from experimental cage sites, meiofauna densities increased significantly compared to open, noncaged areas. Meiobenthic polychaetes and copepods displayed consistent, seasonal increases in abundance inside cages, although their patterns of response were notably different. The dominant meiobenthic copepods, Stenhelia (D.) bifidia, Microarthridion littorale, Enhydrosoma propinquum, and Schizopera knabeni, responded to macroepifauna exclusion by rapidly (within weeks) increasing in density inside cages and, subsequently, crashing to control field levels. Polychaetes, represented mainly by Manayunkia aestuarina, increased more slowly than copepods inside cages, and unlike copepods, showed no signs of density limitation inside macroepifauna—excluded areas. In cage sites reopened to macroepifauna influences, copepod densities decreased to values intermediate between cage and open control areas, while polychaetes were quickly reduced to open field densities. The exclusion of macroepifauna not only produced changes in densities of polychaetes, but also resulted in increased survival of large size classes. My experimental results support the hypothesis that acroepifauna predation/disturbance has an important effect on meiofaunal assemblages, thus providing insight into possible competitive associations between meiofauna taxa.

This study investigated how the availability and predictability of food resources modulates the growth of animals that adopt different behavioral strategies. Results show that, irrespective of the feeding regime, the growth of juvenile brown trout increased with the expression of active foraging behavior and, similarly, with increasing use of shelter. Conversely, territorial aggressive behavior only promoted growth when food resources were spatially and temporally predictable, and only for individuals that had high metabolic rates (when compared with their low metabolic rate siblings). Thus, this study shows that only certain behaviors are associated with variation in the physiology of individuals. Moreover, only certain behaviors associate differently with growth under different environmental conditions. These results are partially consistent with the hypothesis that environmental variability promotes the coexistence of alternative behavioral phenotypes. However, some behaviors enhanced growth irrespective of feeding regime, and we did not identify a set of conditions where fish with low resting metabolic rate (RMR) outperformed their high RMR siblings. Hence, additional layers of environmental variation are likely to be required for individuals with low RMR to show maximal growth performance.","National Environmental Research Council (UK) grant to N.B.M., J.D.A., and T.G.G.G.",,Behavioral Ecology,,Oxford University Press (OUP),"1045-2249, 1465-7279",,2012-09-28,2012,2012-09-28,2013-01-01,24,1,253-261,All OA; Green,Article,"Hoogenboom, Mia O.; Armstrong, John D.; Groothuis, Ton G.

The predictability of the environment allows the extensive biological interactions occurring over evolutionary time to be in the direction of reduction in biological stress. The historic results are stable and complex Biologically Accomodated Communities composed of large numbers of stenotopic species.Not all major taxa of the deep sea are so diverse. Species belonging to these taxa tend to have broader depth ranges, are more cosmopolitian and eurytopic, produce larger number of eggs, and have a larval stage that allows wide dispersion. Such features characterize biota of more physically stressed, low-diversity habitats, e.g. shallow boreal seas. Similar contrasting patterns can be demonstrated for biota in marin, freshwater, and terrestrial regimes when comparing historically stable environments with more variable habitats. Two diverging evolutionary pathways thus lead toward low diversity, physically controlled or high diveristy, biologically accommodated communities and r or K modes of existence.What we know of life-history characteristics of the deep-sea fauna suggests that the alternate thesis of intensive predation as the source of high diversity may not be correct.",,,Sarsia,,Taylor & Francis,"0036-4827, 1503-1128",,1979-05-31,1979,2011-12-21,1979-05-31,64,1-2,1-7,Closed,Article,"Sanders, Howard L.","Sanders, Howard L.

Despite this worrying scenario, the existing knowledge deficiencies may be overcome with species distribution models (SDMs), providing estimates of the effects of CC upon biodiversity. We evaluate the impact of CC on the distribution of the bumble bee species Bombus (Funebribombus) funebris Smith, 1854 (Apidae: Bombini) in South America. The Andean region will remain suitable for B. funebris under models of future CC. Nonetheless, the distribution range size will decrease, especially in protected areas. We believe this is due to the elevation zones preferentially occupied by the bees. The existence and prevalence of the species may be affected by anthropic actions and CC. The growing use of SDMs is critical to minimizing information deficits related to insect species and providing estimates of their distribution ranges.

Seasonal replicate samples for the microphytobenthos, meiofauna and macrofauna were undertaken from October 2003 to October 2004. The analysis of the different component of the benthos permitted to show a clear temporal asynchrony in the microphytobenthos biomass, meiofauna and macrofauna univariate measures increase and decline. Sediment chlorophyll a and phaeopigments followed a similar seasonal trend, with low biomass in the winter, higher in the summer and intermediate values in spring and autumn. The benthic fauna components of the Laguna Estuarine System also showed a clear seasonal oscillation, but with an opposite pattern of variation. Whilst the number of species and abundance of the macrofauna were significantly higher in the spring and summer, for the meiofauna, both the number of taxa and abundances were significantly higher during the winter and autumn. The results of this study suggested that the divergent seasonal variations of the meiofauna and macrofauna may be linked to their different life strategies, and that biological interactions between meiofauna and macrofauna may also play a significant role in structuring these communites.",,,Brazilian Journal of Aquatic Science and Technology,,Editora UNIVALI,"1808-7035, 1983-9057",,2007-10-30,2007,2007-10-30,,11,2,53-62,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Meurer, A.

Using this criterion we successfully discriminated 82% of the lakes between glacial lakes, to which Diaptomus sicilis, Limnocalanus macrurus, Mysis relicta, and Senecella calanoides were restricted, and nonglacial lakes, to which Cyclops scutifer, Eubosmina longispina, Daphnia pulex, D. catawba, and other species were characteristic. A third large group of common species was distributed throughout the study area with no particular relation to glacial lake influence. No clear patterns in community structure with respect to size of zooplankters were discerned. Although some species distributions or abundances were consistent with the well-known predatory and competitive interactions among zooplankters typical of small lakes and ponds, for example, the negative correlation between the predatory Mysis relicta and Eubosmina longispina, most were not. We suggest that this arose partly because the study area is large and heterogeneous and partly because the biological interactions observed in small lakes and ponds may be less intense in the more physically complex environment of large lakes.Key words: zooplankton, community structure, glacial opportunists, multivariate analysis, zoogeography, size-efficiency hypothesis",,,Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences,,Canadian Science Publishing,"0706-652X, 1205-7533",,1981-11-01,1981,,1981-11-01,38,11,1428-1437,Closed,Article,"Roff, J.

Where data existed for early juveniles, ages 0–2, recruitment variability declined with age, but the magnitude of reduction differed suggesting density-dependent geographic variation in regulation of year-class strength at the juvenile stage. On a large spatial scale, recruitment variability in long rough dab showed an increasing south to north latitudinal gradient rejecting the hypothesis that variability was higher at the edges of the range and least in the centre. Recruitment patterns were correlated over the geographic range of the species to examine timing in year-class synchrony. No large-scale patterns emerged, but some adjacent populations showed synchrony in year-class strength, suggesting that a commonality of processes regulating year-class strength existed, but only over short distances.

621,pub.1020891580,10.1017/pab.2016.2,,,,Drilling predation increased in response to changing environments in the Caribbean Neogene,"Abstract Changes in the physical environment are major drivers of evolutionary change, either through direct effects on the distribution and abundance of species or more subtle shifts in the outcome of biological interactions. To investigate this phenomenon, we built a fossil data set of drilling gastropod predation on bivalve prey for the last 11 Myr to determine how the regional collapse in Caribbean upwelling and planktonic productivity affected predator–prey interactions. Contrary to theoretical expectations, predation increased nearly twofold after productivity declined, while the ratio of drilling predators to prey remained unchanged. This increase reflects a gradual, several-fold increase in the extent of shallow-water coral reefs and seagrass meadows in response to the drop in productivity that extended over several million years. Drilling predation is uniformly higher in biogenic habitats than in soft sediments. Thus, changes in predation intensity were driven by a shift in dominant habitats rather than a direct effect of decreased productivity. Most previous analyses of predation through time have not accounted for variations in environmental conditions, raising questions about the patterns observed. More fundamentally, however, the consequences of large-scale environmental perturbations may not be instantaneous, especially when changes in habitat and other aspects of local environmental conditions cause cascading series of effects.","We thank A.

While the oxygen demand in water and sediment may vary slightly from year to year, the oxygen supply to the hypolimnion due to physical processes is quite variable. Detailed calculations show that in years with relatively calm weather (e.g., 1979), physical processes supply only about 10% of the amount needed to offset demand due to uptake in the water and sediment during stratified periods. As the hypolimnion also tends to be relatively shallow in such years, the available oxygen is often quickly depleted. In contrast, during windy years (e.g., 1972) physical sources can supply about 40% of the oxygen consumed and, since the hypolimnion tends to be thicker, the oxygen concentration seldom reaches the anoxic level. It is concluded that analysis with oxygen depletion as an indicator of Lake Erie's recovery due to phosphorus control must consider variability in oxygen sources as a result of physical processes.",,,Journal of Great Lakes Research,,Elsevier,0380-1330,,1987-01,1987,,1987-01,13,4,770-781,Closed,Article,"Lam, D.C.L.; Schertzer, W.M.; Fraser, A.S.","Lam, D.C.L.

Abundance of the species was affected more by the abiotic than by the plant factors although this difference was less marked in the tunicates. Polyclinum was more tolerant of silt and low turbulence than the other species; on short plants it was more abundant on the convex faces of fronds but on long plants it was more abundant on concave faces. Didemnum had a rather limited and usually basal distribution and was commoner on long plants. Scypha compressa was commonest on concave faces and toward the base of plants but extended further out along short plants. When S. compressa and Didemnum occurred on the same plants, Didemnum was competitively displaced along the fronds. When Didemnum and Polyclinum occurred on the same plants, Polyclinum was displaced distally but the abundance of Didemnum was depressed.

Photosynthetic productivity and leaf persistence are negatively correlated, i.e., short-lived leaves often have higher photosynthetic activity and lower defensive ability than long-lived leaves. There are two major hypotheses for explaining the observed variation of leaf longevity: the nutrient use efficiency theory and the carbon balance theory. The theories differ in their viewpoints of the factors limiting photosynthetic activity, i.e. mineral limitation and carbon limitation. In general, plants living in tundra environments suffer from a short growing season, and the extent of this stress changes along the altitudinal, latitudinal and snowmelt gradients in arctic and alpine ecosystems. As season length decreases, deciduous plants produce shorter-lived, lower-LMA and nitrogen-richer leaves, whereas evergreen plants produce longer-lived leaves within and among specics. This contrasting pattern of changes in leaf traits can be explained by a simple graphic model based on the carbon balance theory. The ecological significance of leaf-trait variations should be applied to the fields of reproductive ecology and biological interactions between plants and herbivores.",,,日本生態学会誌,,,0021-5007,,1999-04,1999,,,49,1,21-35,Closed,Article,"岳, 工藤","岳, 工藤 (北海道大学大学院地球環境科学研究科)",,"岳, 工藤 (Hokkaido University)",Hokkaido University,grid.39158.36,Sapporo,Hokkaidô,Japan,,,,,,0,0,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1116097970,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3108 Plant Biology,,,,,,A05 Biological Sciences,

Among other variables affecting faunal assemblages, sedimentation, food supply and oxygen concentration within mats or turfs of coralline algae may greatly depend on the exposure to waves. In this study, peracarid assemblages were compared at replicated rocky shores within different levels of wave exposure, along a coastline in south-eastern Brazil. Overall amphipod diversity (11 species) was much higher than tanaidacean diversity (two species). Correlation analyses did not support any biological interactions between amphipods and tanaidaceans. Habitat complexity, while apparently limiting amphipod populations, did not affect tanaidaceans at a local scale. Amphipod abundance, not assemblage structure, was positively affected by wave exposure, probably improving oxygen concentration levels and renewal of food resources. Rather than abundance, which remains fairly stable, exposure to waves determined species identity in tanaidaceans, with

We tested the hypotheses that species richness of epiflora on the gastropod Turbo torquatus would not differ between regions with similarly rich algal floras, and that epifloral richness would increase with increasing gastropod size. Macroalgal floras of Hamelin Bay (HB), Marmion (M), Jurien Bay (JB) and Kalbarri (K), Western Australia, ranged from ∼20 to 40 species reef–1 (JB = HB = M ≥ K). Epiflora on small T. torquatus (shell area <150 cm2) did not differ among regions but epifloral richness increased with increasing basibiont size. Large T. torquatus (>150 cm2) were only found in Hamelin Bay and Marmion, where epifloral richness differed substantially. Epifloral richness was positively related to basibiont size in Marmion but not in Hamelin Bay. However, densities of patellid limpets on large T. torquatus were ∼4× higher in Hamelin Bay than in Marmion, implying that limpet grazing suppresses epifloral richness. Epifloral richness on turbinids is not simply associated with regional species pools or gastropod size; rather, biological interactions at the scale of individual basibionts apparently govern broad scale patterns of epibiosis.","This research was supported by a Discovery grant from the Australian Research Council to T.W. and G.A.K.

620,pub.1050054863,10.1007/bf00164324,,,,Managing fisheries involving predator and prey species,"Several management strategies for ecosystems with biological interaction are discussed, including predator removal, predator-prey coexistence, prey exploitation, overexploitation, and introduction of sanctuaries. Some case studies related to ecosystem management are briefly presented; these describe Lakes Victoria and Tanganyika, discarding from shrimp trawl fisheries and the development in the North Sea that led to introduction of multispecies analysis. The concept of ‘fishing down the food web’ is discussed and the average trophic levels at which the fisheries operate in different ecosystem types are estimated based on quantified trophic flow models. On a global level, while on average fisheries operate around two trophic levels above the primary producers, still one third of the catch of the 70 major fish species caught in the world is of piscivorous fish. Using exploitation-predation rate indices for different ecosystem types, the amount of finfish consumed globally by finfish is roughly estimated to be three times the catches of finfish. Finally some implications for the management of ecosystems are drawn up. It makes little difference if short-term prognoses are based on single-species or multispecies considerations. Multispecies models may, however, give the better long-term advice, and adaptive management may facilitate the move towards such long-term goals.",,,Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries,,Springer Nature,"0960-3166, 1573-5184",,1996-12,1996,,1996-12,6,4,417-442,Closed,Article,"Christensen, Villy","Christensen, Villy (International Center for Living Aquatic Resources Management, M.C., PO Box 2631, 0718, Makati, Metro Manila, Philippines)",,"Christensen, Villy (Miriam College)",Miriam College,grid.468985.e,Quezon City,,Philippines,,,,,,104,12,,,6,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050054863,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3005 Fisheries Sciences; 31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3109 Zoology",,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,

From coastal to deep-sea ecosystems, ecologists are exploring new areas of research to find model organisms that help predict the future of life on our planet. Among the different categories of organisms, meiofauna offer several advantages for the study of marine benthic ecosystems. This paper reviews the advances in the study of meiofauna with regard to climate change and anthropogenic impacts. Four taxonomic groups are valuable for predicting global changes: foraminifers (especially calcareous forms), nematodes, copepods and ostracods. Environmental variables are fundamental in the interpretation of meiofaunal patterns and multistressor experiments are more informative than single stressor ones, revealing complex ecological and biological interactions. Global change has a general negative effect on meiofauna, with important consequences on benthic food webs. However, some meiofaunal species can be favoured by the extreme conditions induced by global change, as they can exhibit remarkable physiological adaptations. This review highlights the need to incorporate studies on taxonomy, genetics and function of meiofaunal taxa into global change impact research.","The authors thank the western France laboratory cluster (Laboratoire d’Excellence) LabexMER (ANR-10-LABX-19), the French Research Institute for the exploitation of the Sea (IFREMER), the Institut Carnot, the Total Foundation, the Océanopolis aquarium, the Zone Atelier Brest Iroise, the Finistère Departmental Council, the University of Western Brittany, the Brest Métropole Océane, the Brittany Regional Council, the European Institute for Marine Studies, the bank CASDEN Banque Populaire: Banque de l’Education, Recherche et Culture, the Banque Populaire de l’Ouest, the platform PERISCOPE and Grenier Photo for financing the MeioScool2013 project: Meiofaunal International Workshop, held in Brest (26–29 November 2013).

We investigated changes in soil biochemical properties associated with L. virgaurea spreading in grazed alpine meadows at three sites. Soil and root biomass samples were taken at depths of 0–8 cm, 8–16 cm and 16–24 cm from patches where L. virgaurea was dominant and from areas between L. virgaurea patches, with only other native species. Across sites, root biomass, acid-extracted carbohydrate C, organic C and N mineralization, and microbial biomass C and N concentrations in the top 8-cm layer were significantly higher while nitrate N concentration was significantly lower in L. virgaurea patches than in areas between L. virgaurea patches. The increased activities of dehydrogenase, β–glucosidase, urease and phosphatase in the top 8-cm layer under L. virgaurea were associated with enhanced soil microbial biomass. Our results indicate a close association between changes in soil biochemical properties in the top 8-cm layer and the spread of L. virgaurea in grazed alpine meadows of the eastern Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau.","This study was financed by Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (200807300016), innovation group project of China Ministry of Education, and National Natural Science Foundation of China (40930533).

Most species and speciesgroups were capable of colonizing plates in both warm (diffuse vent flows of up to 25°C) and cool (no detectable temperature anomaly) zones. The discovery of numerous protoconch-stage recruits of the limpet Lepetodrilus elevatus on basalt plates in both warm and cool zones, and in two study sites separated by >1km, indicated that a very recent, regional settlement event had taken place. Size distributions of the L. elevatus colonists suggest a previous distinct recruitment event also may have taken place during the three-year interval. Of the prominent vent taxa whose adult distributions were known, a few colonized only the zones inhabited by adults (the scallop ?Bathypecten, the polychaete Paralvinella, and vestimentiferan tubeworms), but two others colonized outside the adult ranges (the bivalve Bathymodiolus, and the polychaete Laminatubus).

Environmental variation is thought to be a primary factor in evolution, especially at high latitudes. In contrast, tropical areas are traditionally viewed as the cradle where the long-term effects of biological interactions on phenotypic change reside. We analyse patterns of skull shape variation in two New World monkey groups: capuchins and howlers. These two monophyletic clades are exceptionally similar in terms of the geographic distribution of their species. Yet, their body size and diet are different: howler monkeys are large and almost exclusively folivorous, whereas capuchins are small omnivorous. We found that the size, and direction of vectors of phenotypic changes across South American biomes in those clades are not statistically different. This similarity persists after removing the strong impact of allometry in our data. Additionally, partial least squares and comparative analyses confirm that “allometry free” skull shape is influenced to the same set of environmental variables in both clades. This study remarks the paramount importance of both body size and environmental variation on phenotypic evolution.","We are grateful curators and staff of the Museu Nacional (MNRJ) (J.A. de Oliveira and S.M.

We examined the influence of colour on recruitment. Manipulative field experiments showed that: (1) more spirorbids recruited to darkcoloured boulders than to light-coloured boulders regardless of the type of rock; (2) the colour of the top of the boulder made little difference to the number of spirorbids recruiting to the undersurface of the boulders; and (3) more spirorbids recruited to shale boulders with darkcoloured undersurfaces than to those with light-coloured undersurfaces regardless of the colour of the top of the boulders. These results highlight the importance of colour as a physical factor affecting the recruitment of spirorbids to initially bare boulders. The colour of boulders did not, however, explain the magnitude of differences in recruitment to sandstone and shale boulders; other physical factors such as surface texture of the boulders may be important. Biological interactions such as the “gregariousness” of spirorbids may amplify initial patterns of recruitment in the short-term but shortages of space may cause spirorbids to recruit to initially unfavourable habitats.",,,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology,,Elsevier,"0022-0981, 1879-1697",,1994-08,1994,,1994-08,181,1,105-115,Closed,Article,"James, R.J.; Underwood, A.J.","James, R.J.

620,pub.1059976577,10.1093/plankt/fbv094,,,,Primary productivity in a coastal ecosystem: a trophic perspective on a long-term time series,"To investigate forcing factors on a coastal plankton food web, primary production was measured every 2 weeks for 28 years. On a decadal scale, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) correlated positively to primary production (r = 0.44, P = 0.021) and winter surface nitrate (r = 0.60, P = 0.0014) and phosphate (r = 0.66, P = 0.0003; r = 0.60, P = 0.0014). This suggests that climate forcing through increased wind and vertical mixing leads to higher entrainment of nutrients which stimulate yearly primary production. The highest production occurred in summer (1105 ± 16 mg C m−2 day−1) and correlated positively with zooplankton biomass (r = 0.61, P = 0.037), but showed no relation to phytoplankton biomass. Estimated phytoplankton grazing by copepods was low, but ciliates had the potential to remove all the phytoplankton biomass daily. Copepods, in turn, could exert a strong predation on ciliates which indicates a top-down regulation of phytoplankton biomass. Advection of copepods into the fjord and predation of jellyfish are suggested as the main regulatory factors for the copepod populations. We conclude that climate affects the pelagic ecosystem in the fjord through the NAO, but that biological interactions through grazing and predation by copepods regulate the system on a seasonal scale, indicative of a trophic cascade.","Numerous people contributed to the time series through the years, but we particularly thank Bodil Hernoth, Lennart Davidsson, Pia Engström, Hans Olsson and Lars Ljunqvist for collecting the data on primary production and Lene Friis Møller for information on jellyfish.

Three stations were selected, one upstream and two at 0.25 km and 6 km downstream from a hydropower plant which causes 7-fold discharge increases. We collected hyporheic invertebrates for two years. Taxa diversity and abundance were reduced in the impacted sites, especially affecting the stygobites, which were significantly less abundant at the impacted sites, whereas stygoxene invertebrates increased exponentially. Repeated hydropeaking events alter the physical-chemical characteristics of the hyporheic habitat, resulting in the recorded faunistic pattern. The deposition of the fine sediment transported by the turbinated water downstream of the power plant and the absence of natural peak floods which remove fine sediments, probably cause a reduction of the interstitial space interstitial habitat available to stygobitic taxa. Surface water natural thermal regime is altered by the hypolimnetic discharges, and such alterations propagate into the hyporheic, affecting the stenothermic taxa. Some benthic taxa used the hyporheic habitat as a refuge to avoid catastrophic drift during hydropower production operation. The main trophic roles represented in the hyporheic assemblages do not support an important role for biological interactions such as predation in determining the fine-scale patchiness of the hyporheos.",,,Annales de Limnologie - International Journal of Limnology,,EDP Sciences,"0003-4088, 2100-000X",,2009-08-04,2009,2009-08-04,2009,45,3,157-170,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Bruno, Maria Cristina; Maiolini, Bruno; Carolli, Mauro; Silveri, Luana","Bruno, Maria Cristina (Fondazione Edmund Mach, IASMA Research and Innovation Centre, Environment and Natural Resources Area, Via E.

First, we selected four functional types, based on their unique water use and redistribution functionality: shrubs, Asphodelus ramosus, other herbaceous plants and surface crusts. We estimated percentage of surface covered by these functional types and by bedrock outcrops and loose surface stones. Additionally data was collected on soil depth, relative elevation, insolation, slope, curvature, and overlain with surface cover maps. Relations between functional types and landscape structure variables were analyzed with descriptive statistics. The landscape structure variables bedrock, relative elevation, soil depth and surface stones explained most of the cover variance in the catchments. In catchments with many bedrock outcrops, functional types were best explained by the landscape structure variables. In catchments with homogeneous soils reaching beyond the root zone, the biological interactions between functional types were more important. Along the precipitation gradient the explanatory power of the biological variables decreased with decreasing precipitation, while the explanatory power of landscape structure variables appeared unrelated. Only in homogeneous semi-arid catchments regular vegetation patterns can develop, in arid and heterogeneous catchments irregular patterns dominate.","The authors would like to thank Maartje Fransen, Marleen de Blécourt and Lieke Geraedts for assistance with fieldwork.

The implementation of standardised long-term monitoring programmes enables the early identification of new alien species, the tracking of spread, the assessment of the effectiveness of management interventions, and an understanding of temporal and spatial trends. Globally, fouling species are known to cause economic losses through accumulation on vessel hulls and port infrastructure and via the disruption of aquaculture activities. Additionally, fouling taxa can have ecological impacts in recipient systems, most often driven by their dominance in biological interactions. In South Africa, this group accounts for the majority of marine alien taxa. Accordingly, this study tested an approach for monitoring fouling biota using open and caged PVC settlement plates deployed in marinas. After 16 weeks, plates were removed, biota identified, and relative abundance captured as percentage cover. This method proved to be effective, logistically simple and cost-efficient. Twenty-four taxa were recorded, of which 58% were invasive species.

A correct interpretation of these chemical signals requires knowledge of the habitat and trophic interactions of the species. Direct observations on the biological interactions of N. pachyderma in polar environments are lacking and to date no consensus exists on the trophic behavior of this species. Here, we use single-cell metabarcoding to characterize the interactions of 39 specimens of N. pachyderma from two sites in the Baffin Bay with the local eukaryotic pelagic community. Our results show that the eukaryotic interactome of the foraminifera is dominated by diatoms, accounting for >50% of the reads in 17 of the samples, but other groups such as Crustacea and Syndiniales are also present. The high abundance Syndiniales suggests that these parasites could infect N. pachyderma and may play an important role in its population dynamics. Moreover, the strong but taxonomically non-specific association with algae, existing irrespective of depth and occurring in specimens collected far below the photic zone indicates that opportunistically grazed diatom-fueled marine aggregates likely represent the main interaction substrate of N. pachyderma.",The master and crew of the F.S.

Most of them retain low taxonomic diversities. Although some of them have survived in refuges to avoid predators and competitors, not all living fossils live in refuges. The survival of these groups, therefore, should be discussed in the context of biological interaction. I carried out computer simulations of a model food web system, in which each species feeds on others according to its feeding preference. The system evolves via evolution of species. In the simulation, some clades, like “living fossils,” survived for a long time with low species diversities. Such clades consisted of species with low evolutionary rates, which result in high predation pressure and intraclade competition for food. Nevertheless, the clades sustainably utilize prey clades and are consequently provided with sufficient food. In addition, because of the low species diversities of the clades, predators of the clades soon become extinct through lack of food. This study strongly suggests that in an evolving food web system, the low evolutionary rates of living fossils allow the long survival of those groups with low taxonomic diversities.","I thank A.

Photosynthesis and growth: Simulated effects of selected physical-chemical variables and biological interactions,"A computer model was developed to simulate photosynthesis and growth of eelgrass (Zostera marina L.), the dominant submerged aquatic macrophyte occurring in the lower Chesapeake Bay, Virginia, U.S.A. The mathematical structure of the model is based on theoretical non-linear functions for simulating biologically controlled processes and empirical or statistical relationships for incorporating physical-chemical interactions and environmental forcing functions. Analyses of the model for 1-, 4- and 10-year simulation periods indicate that submarine light quantity (PAR) and temperature are the principal physical factors governing eelgrass photosynthesis and growth in the lower Chesapeake Bay. Typical in situ light and temperature conditions, however, constrain photosynthesis and therefore plant growth to less than physiologically capable potentials. Small changes in submarine irradiance, temperature or their combined interaction result in decreased plant productivity and eventual loss of the eelgrass community. Empirical and hypothetical relationships in the model of epiphyte colonization and growth and epiphytic grazing indicate that eelgrass growth and long-term survival are potentially governed by factors that control and limit the attached epiphytic community. Model simulations suggest that a principal factor is the interaction between epiphytic grazing intensity and ambient light levels.",,,Aquatic Botany,,Elsevier,"0304-3770, 1879-1522",,1986-01,1986,,1986-01,26,,307-323,Closed,Article,"Wetzel, Richard L.; Neckles, Hilary A.","Wetzel, Richard L.

Two experimental manipulations were imposed: the addition of other crustacean species and imposition of externally forced temperature variations. Linear time series analysis revealed cyclic dynamics, with periods ranging from 41 to 182 d. Periodic behavior was qualitatively robust to both experimental manipulations. It occurred in populations of D. pulicaria in microcosms with and without additional species of crustaceans, and it occurred in populations of D. magna with and without externally imposed oscillations in temperature. Periodicity was observed both in populations that persisted and in those that went extinct during the experiment. The experimental treatment of additional crustacean species, and perhaps that of temperature forcing, reduced the period of oscillation. For the longest time series, nonlinear autoregression techniques gave negative Lyapunov exponents, consistent with stable but noisy periodic dynamics rather than chaotic dynamics. Periodic models with a single fundamental frequency typically did not capture all the periodic behavior, however, suggesting that additional frequencies or responses to demographic stochasticity were present.","This research was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council through the Centre for Population Biology and grant number GR3/7542.

The case is made for recognition of the marine bivalve Limaria hians as a reef‐forming species, which plays a key architectural role in certain benthic communities around the United Kingdom and Ireland. 2. This species uses byssal threads to construct nests that can coalesce to form reefs that cover hectares of seabed, contain multiple conspecifics and bind sediment. In so doing, L. hians modifies physical, chemical and biological processes at the sediment–water interface. 3. Such nests support a high diversity of associated organisms in coarse‐grade sediments (19 species of algae and 265 species of invertebrates from six discrete nests in Loch Fyne are reported on), although the biological interactions between species both inside and outside this assemblage (e.g. predatory cod) are unknown. 4. Being insubstantial, labyrinthine structures situated on the sediment surface, Limaria nests are sensitive to mechanical impacts, such as those caused by moorings, hydraulic dredging for infaunal bivalves and scallop dredging. 5. At appropriate sites, the status of L. hians can contribute a useful indication of disturbance on coarse‐grade sediments.

For analyses of habitat preference we used mist-net samples and an unpublished bird species check-list. The igapó forest had lower bird species diversity than the terra firme forest. However, some 14% of the forest bird species in the region are restricted to igapó forest. Species composition was found to be distinct between the understories of the two forest types. Common forest bird guilds in the Neotropics such as ant-following birds avoid igapó forest. The differential habitat selection among birds in the inundated and unflooded forest is likely to result from vegetation structure and biological interactions such as aggressive behaviour. Since the inundated forest has a typical biota, conservation efforts needs to be directed to protect these habitats. Unfortunately, inundation forests are threatened by several human actions, especially dam construction. The extent of protected areas in the Brazilian Amazon is insufficient for the adequate protection of the inundated habitats, because it includes only 3% of the total area.",,,Biodiversity and Conservation,,Springer Nature,"0960-3115, 1572-9710",,2000-02,2000,,2000-02,9,2,201-214,Closed,Article,"Borges, Sérgio Henrique; Carvalhaes, André","Borges, Sérgio Henrique (Centro de Ciências do Ambiente (CCA/UA), Universidade do Amazonas, Av.

602,pub.1042875754,10.1007/bf00390790,,,,Physical factors controlling abundance of meiofauna on tidal and atidal beaches,"Quantitative samples of interstitial sand beach meiofauna were collected from Morocco along the North African coast (Algeria and Tunisia) and northwards to Lebanon, Turkey and Cyprus. Data on the sediment median diameter, sorting coefficient and beach temperature were used to construct multiple-regression equations relating these factors to the total meiofaunal numbers. Curvilinear regression was found to give a significantly better fit than linear regression in all cases but one. Treating the whole Mediterranean data, the equation explained 9.3% of the variance in meiofaunal abundance. Within narrower geographical areas, however, the equations explained significantly more of the variance: 56.70% of Moroccan tidal beach data, 75.60% of South Tunisian tidal beach data, and 62.3% of South Tunisian atidal beach data. For the tidal beach equations sorting was the most important factor, followed by temperature and median diameter. It is suggested that the factors controlling meiofaunal abundance on these beaches are likely to be wave, tide and current action which also control sorting. The lack of fit of most atidal beach data suggests that here biological interactions such as competition and predation may control meiofaunal abundance. The detection of beaches affected by pollutants may also be possible using regression techniques. Beaches having a significantly enriched population (sewage-induced) or depleted population (pollutant-induced) can be readily detected.",,,Marine Biology,,Springer Nature,"0025-3162, 1432-1793",,1976-01,1976,,1976-01,34,1,77-83,Closed,Article,"Hulings, N.

The physico-chemical and biological interactions between the coastal ecosystems have been perceived, but are rarely explored for better understanding of their connectivity. Mangroves forests and seagrass meadows are the coastal ecosystems of intense nutrient cycling, whereas the coral reef areas are poor in nutrients and Hence, the nutrient-rich coastal systems supply nutrients to adjacent coral reefs. The mangroves and seagrass provide nursery grounds for many faunal species, while the coral reefs provide habitat for them. The mangroves protect seagrass beds and coral reefs from landward discharges and sedimentations, while the coral reefs also protect the other systems by buffering ocean currents and dissipating wave action. The successful connectivity between the three ecosystems is vital for fishery resources, nutrient balance and mitigation of climate change. Hence, the interactions between the ecosystems are not only the state of the biodiversity enrichment but also the flow nutrient and energy. The deleterious effect of any one ecosystem will directly or indirectly affect the other ecosystems. It is a matter of necessity to conserve coastal ecosystems simultaneously in order to ensure a better goods and ecosystem services. Propagation and enrichment of mangrove ecosystem is easier than that of seagrasses and coral reefs and hence, development and diversification of mangrove system is recommended for multiple ecosystem management.",,,Ecologia,,Science Alert,1996-4021,,2010-12-15,2010,,2010-12-15,1,1,1-22,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kathiresan, Kandasamy; M.

Morren, a threatened Japanese plant species in a highly fragmented landscape in southern Hokkaido. The smaller populations (genets <=; 3) set almost no seeds consistently during the study years. In larger populations (genets >= 7), proportions of failed flowers without damage from fungi or herbivores were relatively high, but fruit set per flower varied among the populations in 1995. Correlations of fruit (r = 0.589, P = 0.011) and seed‐ set (r = 0.688, P < 0.01) with population pollinator availability were highly significant. In 1995, pollination failure would be the most plausible reason for the variation in reproductive success among the populations. However, pollinator availability was relatively high in all populations in 1996 and 1997. In these years, higher proportions of fruit failed because of antagonistic biological interactions. In the populations with poor pollinator availability in 1995, mean fruit and seed‐sets were greater in the long‐styled morph than in the short‐styled morph. Such between‐morph differences are thought to be caused by partial self‐compatibility of the long‐styled morph and the results of hand pollination experiments support this hypothesis.",,,Ecological Research,,Wiley,"0912-3814, 1440-1703",,2000-09,2000,2001-12-24,2000-09,15,3,307-322,Closed,Article,"Matsumura, Chizuru; Washitani, Izumi","Matsumura, Chizuru (Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305‐8572, Japan and); Washitani, Izumi (Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1‐1‐1 Yayoi, Bunkyo‐ku, Tokyo, 113‐8657, Japan)",,"Matsumura, Chizuru (University of Tsukuba); Washitani, Izumi (University of Tokyo)",University of Tokyo; University of Tsukuba,grid.26999.3d; grid.20515.33,Tokyo; Tsukuba,; Ibaraki,Japan; Japan,,,,,,61,1,,5.02,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1018100792,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3108 Plant Biology,,,,,,A05 Biological Sciences,15 Life on Land

Microcosm experiments were conducted at two contrasting stations (Stns S1 and S2) with three different UVR treatments and two DOC addition treatments. Our results showed that natural sunlight UVR or increased UV-B did not affect phytoplankton biomass and primary production. However, increased UV-B significantly decreased the proportion of picophytoplankton and the efficiency of carbon fixation at Stn S2. DOC enhancement caused negative effects on primary production under natural sunlight UVR only at Stn S1. Interactive effects of UVR and DOC addition on phytoplankton biomass and primary production were detected at Stn S1, due to the negative effects of DOC being eliminated under the increased UV-B condition. The lack of interactive effects at Stn S2 were likely due to the differences with Stn S1 in terms of light acclimation and biological interaction. In summary, this future climate change scenario will probably not affect the photosynthetic CO2 fixation and biomass of natural phytoplankton in Sanya Bay.","We acknowledge the support from the NSFC Projects (31370500, 31370499).",,Ocean Science Journal,,Springer Nature,"1225-1283, 1738-5261, 2005-7172",,2019-11-11,2019,2019-11-11,2019-12,54,4,581-593,Closed,Article,"Liao, Jianzu; Xu, Jie; Yuan, Xiangcheng; Liang, Yuxian; Guo, Yajuan; Zhou, Weihua; Huang, Hui; Liu, Sheng; Long, Aimin","Liao, Jianzu (CAS Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Applied Marine Biology, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 510301, Guangzhou, China; Tropical Marine Biological Research Station in Hainan, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 572000, Sanya, China; State Key Laboratory of Tropical Oceanography, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 510301, Guangzhou, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100049, Beijing, China); Xu, Jie (State Key Laboratory of Tropical Oceanography, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 510301, Guangzhou, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100049, Beijing, China); Yuan, Xiangcheng (CAS Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Applied Marine Biology, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 510301, Guangzhou, China; Hainan Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Biotechnology, 572000, Sanya, China); Liang, Yuxian (CAS Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Applied Marine Biology, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 510301, Guangzhou, China; Tropical Marine Biological Research Station in Hainan, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 572000, Sanya, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100049, Beijing, China; Hainan Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Biotechnology, 572000, Sanya, China); Guo, Yajuan (Testing Center of Marine Environment, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 510301, Guangzhou, China); Zhou, Weihua (CAS Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Applied Marine Biology, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 510301, Guangzhou, China; Tropical Marine Biological Research Station in Hainan, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 572000, Sanya, China; Hainan Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Biotechnology, 572000, Sanya, China); Huang, Hui (CAS Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Applied Marine Biology, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 510301, Guangzhou, China; Tropical Marine Biological Research Station in Hainan, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 572000, Sanya, China; Hainan Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Biotechnology, 572000, Sanya, China); Liu, Sheng (CAS Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Applied Marine Biology, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 510301, Guangzhou, China; Hainan Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Biotechnology, 572000, Sanya, China); Long, Aimin (University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100049, Beijing, China)","Zhou, Weihua (South China Sea Institute Of Oceanology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; )","Liao, Jianzu (South China Sea Institute Of Oceanology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; South China Sea Institute Of Oceanology; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences); Xu, Jie (South China Sea Institute Of Oceanology; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences); Yuan, Xiangcheng (South China Sea Institute Of Oceanology); Liang, Yuxian (South China Sea Institute Of Oceanology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences); Guo, Yajuan (South China Sea Institute Of Oceanology); Zhou, Weihua (South China Sea Institute Of Oceanology; Chinese Academy of Sciences); Huang, Hui (South China Sea Institute Of Oceanology; Chinese Academy of Sciences); Liu, Sheng (South China Sea Institute Of Oceanology); Long, Aimin (University of Chinese Academy of Sciences)",University of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; South China Sea Institute Of Oceanology,grid.410726.6; grid.9227.e; grid.458498.c,Beijing; Beijing; Guangzhou,; Beijing; ,China; China; China,National Natural Science Foundation of China,,China,grant.8178443; grant.8178442,31370500; 31370499,3,3,,0.62,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1122479487,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 37 Earth Sciences; 3701 Atmospheric Sciences,Climate-Related Exposures and Conditions,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,

However, recent progress in molecular techniques has allowed us to tackle these invisible microbes, and several intriguing reports are now being published. First, this review provides basic information on nectar microbes: 1) they are common among diverse plant species; 2) some species are generalist nectivores, detected in various plants; 3) microbes consume sugar and amino acids, altering the nectar composition; 4) they are transferred by pollinators or air flow; and 5) their immigration into nectar is restricted by several factors. Second, based on these facts and a few examples of deleterious effects on plant reproduction, we discuss possible plant-pollinator-microbe interactions and their evolutionary consequences, with suggestions for future investigations. We also emphasize that microbes do not necessarily act as robbers; there is room for cooperation to evolve because both plants and microbes depend on pollinators for their dispersal, as suggested by plants harboring alcohol- or heat- producing yeasts, probably to attract pollinators.

This strategy is adopted by several, phylogenetically distinct, phytoplankton groups and is commonly occurring in marine, brackish and freshwater ecosystems. Traditionally, it has been put in relation to both scarcity of inorganic nutrients and poor light conditions. However, we observed blooms of the mixotrophic, toxic haptophyte Prymnesium parvum in different periods of the year and under variable resources availability. The analysis of a 6.5-year data set of phytoplankton weekly records from a Sicilian shallow lake (Biviere di Gela, south-eastern Sicily) allowed us to hypothesise that a depleted condition as regards inorganic nutrients is not the main fuel to the growth of P. parvum, neither this is due to light limitation. The results achieved show that an increased availability in suitable preys can stimulate the growth of this phagotrophic photoautotroph. Contemporarily, it was not found any clear environmental patterns to explain species dominance and growth patterns as related to inorganic nutrient availability. Moreover, it is shown that these organisms tend to monopolise resources when these become available irrespective of seasons, and under variable conditions as regards inorganic nutrient availability.",,,Hydrobiologia,,Springer Nature,"1037-0544, 1573-8590, 0018-8158, 1573-5117",,2018-01-31,2018,2018-01-31,2019-03,831,1,33-41,Closed,Article,"Naselli-Flores, Luigi; Barone, Rossella","Naselli-Flores, Luigi (Department of Biological, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Technologies (STEBICEF), University of Palermo, Via Archirafi, 28, 90133, Palermo, Italy); Barone, Rossella (Department of Biological, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Technologies (STEBICEF), University of Palermo, Via Archirafi, 28, 90133, Palermo, Italy)","Naselli-Flores, Luigi (University of Palermo)","Naselli-Flores, Luigi (University of Palermo); Barone, Rossella (University of Palermo)",University of Palermo,grid.10776.37,Palermo,,Italy,,,,,,11,4,,2.25,1,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1100741352,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,

We evaluated the effects of various external factors on the population numerical abundance of curimba Prochilodus lineatus in the upper Paraná River floodplain, Brazil, over a 19-year period. Panel data analysis was applied to examine the structure of temporal and spatial abundance while controlling auto-regressive processes and spatial non-homogeneity variances that often obscure relationships. As sources of population variation, we considered predation, competition, selected abiotic variables, construction of a dam upstream of the study area, water level and flood intensity during the spawning period. We found that biological interactions (predation and competition) were not significantly related to variations in curimba abundance; specific conductance was a space indicator of abundance, apparently linked to the biology of the species; intensity of floods determined inter-annual variation in abundances; Porto Primavera Dam negatively impacted the abundances at sites in the floodplain directly affected by discharges from the dam. Panel data analysis was a powerful tool that identified the need for intense flooding to maintain high abundances of curimba in the upper Paraná River.

The latter are characterized by the dominance of microbialites that encrusted and bound the frame-building sponges and inter-sponge sediments. In contrast, the lithistid spongebryozoan and bryozoanpelmatozoan reefs are generally characterized by bryozoans that encrusted the frame-building sponges or pelmatozoans and grew to fill the inter-frameworks. These sponges and pelmatozoans did not construct the rigid frameworks unaided; their association with bryozoans enabled the development of small skeletal-dominated reefs with rigid frameworks. Skeletal-dominated reefs, for which frame-constructing and encrusting roles are conspicuous, were largely unknown before the Early Ordovician. The appearance of skeletal organisms (specifically colonial, encrusting bryozoans) enabled the development of skeletal-dominated reefs, which were pioneers in the rise of MiddleLate Ordovician reefs. The Early Ordovician establishment of skeletal-dominated reefs at the earliest stages of the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event would have created novel niches and biological interactions that further promoted the evolution of reef-building and -dwelling organisms, as well as ensuing reef ecosystems.","We thank Shuhai Xiao, Edith L.

Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) is one of the most problematic invasive macrophyte in the world. Although it has become a key element of the systems where it was introduced several decades ago, there is insufficient information to determine its role on biological interactions. To elucidate water hyacinth–littoral zooplankton–planktivorous fish interactions, we conducted habitat choice experiments in the absence and presence of fish chemical cues (kairomones) for two tropical littoral cladocerans, Chydorus brevilabris and Simocephalus vetulus. We classified habitat selection as a habitat (preference for the plant without predation risk) and/or as a refuge (preference for the plant with predation risk). Our results showed that E. crassipes is used as a habitat by C. brevilabris and as a refuge by S. vetulus against fish predation. Although C. brevilabris did not use the water hyacinth as a refuge in the presence of kairomones, the results suggested that both C. brevilabris and S. vetulus exhibited behavioral responses that further reduced their predation risk. To our knowledge, this study is the first experimental evidence for littoral cladocerans using free-floating macrophytes as a refuge against fish predation in tropical systems. Our results support the assertion that habitat association is not necessarily an evidence of habitat preference.","We are grateful to Roberto Altamirano and Raquel González for their assistance during the fieldwork.

To evaluate the association between the invasive clam Corbicula fluminea and its oligochaete symbiont Chaetogaster limnaei, we conducted laboratory assessments of prevalence and intensity of infection, external and internal macroscopic alterations, and histological analyses of the gills of uninfected and infected clams collected from the shores of the Río de la Plata estuary in Argentina. To evaluate potential ramifications of physical alterations on physiological traits and host fitness, we conducted respiration experiments on the same clams. Worm prevalence was higher in smaller than large clams. While no macroscopical alterations were detected, several histopathological changes were observed in the gills of infected clams. Infected clams had significantly higher metabolic rates than uninfected conspecifics and smaller clams had higher metabolic rates than larger conspecifics. Increased host metabolic rates, even at very low infections intensities, were likely a compensatory response to the stress caused by gill damaged inflicted by the oligochaetes. The relationship between C. limnaei and invasive C. fluminea in Río de la Plata best fits as parasitism.","The authors would like to thank Alejandro Pietrek, Nuria Vázquez, and Lilian Davies for providing statistical advice and help with data conversions.

We investigated the species–area relationships, detritus content input and trophic interactions of macroinvertebrate fauna in 46 Vrieseae friburguensis in a “Restinga” environment. Our hypotheses are that (i) bromeliad water volume and detritus content would positively affect the macroinvertebrate richness and abundance; (ii) predators would exercise a top-down effect on macroinvertebrates community; but (iii) will control the prey in different ways, due to the preference to occupy and stay in a spatial position on the bromeliad tank. We found 2201 macroinvertebrates from 18 taxa (12 preys and 6 predators). Higher water volume, detritus content and bromeliad area increased the richness and abundance of macroinvertebrates. Culicidae (swimming preys) coexist with predators due to the segregation in the use of the water column caused by the presence of Chironomidae (browsing preys). The opposite response of browsing and swimming preys to predator abundance suggests that trophic interactions are more important to swimming preys than for browsing ones, and this latter is more related to abiotic factors. Therefore, abiotic factors (mainly, water volume) and trophic interactions (abundance of predators) drive the macroinvertebrate community of bromeliad tanks in the studied Neotropical Restinga.",RSR is grateful to the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) and Chico Mendes Institute for Conservation of Biodiversity (ICMBio) in Projects Number 421288/2017–5 and 405290/2018–7.

(Oxalidaceae) plant species,"About twenty-five percent of all southern African Oxalis species are rare/endangered and highly localized, making them especially vulnerable to extinction through inbreeding, low genetic variation, disrupted biological interactions and stochastic events; all consequences of small population sizes. Moreover, Oxalis displays tristyly, which is a rare and specialized sexual system that includes a strong self-incompatibility component between three floral morphs to promote out-crossing within populations. As tristyly requires the availability of plants with different floral morphs as well as effective pollinators for seed production, this breeding system can affect small populations when fully expressed. Factors that may have an effect on rarity in Oxalis were investigated by focusing on the expression of tristyly, levels of natural seed production, clonality and the ecology of eight rare/highly localized Oxalis species. Field experiments revealed that the reproductive success of some Oxalis species may be hampered by tristyly, resulting in extremely low levels of natural seed production. Other species display a more relaxed expression of self-incompatibility, which in combination with the possibility of cross-pollinations provides reproductive assurance regardless of population structure and pollinator availability. Others are rare and endangered, but appear not to be negatively affected by the tristylous breeding system. Most species are limited by their highly specific habitat requirements and are particularly vulnerable to variation in rainfall patterns.","We thank the South African National Biodiversity Institute (Threatened Species Program) and the National Research Foundation (GUN 2053585) for funding this project.

The experimental setup consisted of fifteen 30 l microcosms, filled with water from the Barcelona Harbour and subjected to treatments combining nutrient inputs at three different N:P ratios (Redfield N:P ratio or nutrient-balanced, high N:P and low N:P), addition or omission of A. catenella (an estimated initial concentration of 38 A. catenella cells ml−1, a value typical for blooms in harbours of the Catalan coast), and selective addition of a cultured population of Acartia grani. P sufficiency had a strong positive effect on the growth of A. grani, both with or without A. catenella addition, presumably due to enhanced food quality of the prey community. The presence of this copepod resulted in lower concentrations of ciliates, A. catenella, and other dinoflagellates, suggesting active grazing by the copepods. No noxious effects of A. catenella on the copepods were detected at the relatively low cell concentrations of that dinoflagellate used in the experiment.","Financial support was provided by projects BIOHAB (EVK3-1999-00072) of the European Union and ZOOTRANSFER (REN2001-1693/MAR) of the Spanish CICYT.

Limitations, omissions and strengths of commonly used experimental approaches with special emphasis on the neglected role of fluctuations","Much of our past research on ocean acidification has focussed on direct responses to pCO2 increase at the (sub-) organism level, but does not produce findings that can be projected into the natural context. On the basis of a review of ~350 recent articles mainly on ocean acidification effects, we highlight major limitations of commonly used experimental approaches. Thus, the most common type of investigation, simplified and tightly controlled laboratory experiments, has yielded a wealth of findings on short-term physiological responses to acidification, but any extrapolation to the natural ecosystem level is still problematic. For this purpose, an upscaling is required regarding the number of stressors, of ontogenetic stages, of species, of populations, of generations as well as the incorporation of fluctuating intensities of stress. Because the last aspect seems to be the least recognised, we treat in more detail the natural fluctuations of the carbonate system at different temporal and spatial scales. We report on the very rare investigations that have assessed the biological relevance of natural pH or pCO2 fluctuations. We conclude by pleading the case for more natural research approaches that integrate several organisational levels on the response side, several drivers, biological interactions and environmental fluctuations at various scales.","We greatly appreciate the valuable comments of Christopher Cornwall (University of Perth, WA, Australia) on an earlier version of this article.

A survey of all fruit in 0.25 ha plot revealed that galled fruit parasitized by the fruit gall midge Asphondylia aucubae occurred at 57% in a set produced in 1998 and at 77% in 1999. This pre-dispersal predation reduced heavily the seed production because about only 10∼20% of the galled fruits contained an intact seed. Mature intact fruits were almost completely consumed, and the seeds were dispersed for a short period from late April to early May by migrating Brown-eared Bulbul Hypsipetes amaurotis. We confirmed that wood mice ate the seed, but less than 10% of seeds sown at the site disappeared. Post-dispersal predation pressure by rodents may not have been heavy. The germination rate was about 80%, and the survival rate of one-year seedling was acceptable under good conditions.

While copepods support most food webs and the biological pump of carbon into the deep ocean, chaetognaths and jellyfish may affect the strength of the top‐down control upon plankton communities.

Large‐scale climate forcing has altered the pelagic food‐web dynamics through changes in biological interactions, competition and predation, leading to substantial changes manifested as bursts or collapses in zooplankton populations, and consequently to a major change ca. 1987. These events become more frequent in the 1980s and the early 1990s in the studied zooplankton functional groups suggesting a shift in the functioning of the pelagic ecosystem. The environmental modifications and the results reported here are therefore, indicators of a regime change pointing to a more regeneration‐dominated system in the study area. We suggest a chain of mechanisms, whereby climate variation has modified the long‐term dynamics of pelagic copepods, chaetognaths and jellyfish in the Ligurian Sea.","The authors wish to thank the staff of the Laboratory of Oceanography of Villefranche whose commitment to sampling and technical support has made this long‐term survey possible.

Daphnia are crustaceans that play an intermediate role in biological interactions within food webs. The morphology and body specification of Daphnia differ during growth; hence, it is essential to apply species-specific equations to estimate biomass. We evaluated the length–weight regression equations used previously to estimate Daphnia magna biomass and conducted regression analyses using various body specifications and biomass measurements taken directly using devices such as a microbalance and microscopic camera. Biomass estimated using an equation from the Environmental Protection Agency was significantly different from the direct measurement: average biomass was lower, indicating that the equation possibly underestimated actual biomass. The biomass of D. magna had a higher multiple R2 value when length was compared with width and area, and a linear regression equation was the most suitable equation for biomass estimation. Because body specifications and biomass are affected by various environmental factors, the development of accurate species-specific biomass estimation equations will contribute to obtaining fundamental data with which the biological responses of zooplankton to aquatic ecosystem changes can be assessed.",,,Sustainability,,MDPI,2071-1050,,2022-07-27,2022,2022-07-27,,14,15,9216,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ku, Doyeong; Chae, Yeon-Ji; Choi, Yerim; Ji, Chang Woo; Park, Young-Seuk; Kwak, Ihn-Sil; Kim, Yong-Jae; Chang, Kwang-Hyeon; Oh, Hye-Ji","Ku, Doyeong (); Chae, Yeon-Ji (); Choi, Yerim (); Ji, Chang Woo (); Park, Young-Seuk (); Kwak, Ihn-Sil (); Kim, Yong-Jae (); Chang, Kwang-Hyeon (); Oh, Hye-Ji ()",,"Ku, Doyeong (); Chae, Yeon-Ji (); Choi, Yerim (); Ji, Chang Woo (); Park, Young-Seuk (); Kwak, Ihn-Sil (); Kim, Yong-Jae (); Chang, Kwang-Hyeon (); Oh, Hye-Ji ()",,,,,,National Research Foundation of Korea; Korea Environmental Industry and Technology Institute,,South Korea; South Korea,,,1,1,,,2,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/15/9216/pdf?version=1658926066,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149862563,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 41 Environmental Sciences,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

While some differences are related to physical conditions (e.g., standing water, tidal level), others arise from local biological interactions and may reverse expectations based on tidal level alone. Wet and bare surfaces apart, juvenile input is regularly highest among mid- and upper-shore mussels, while growth and maximum size are least among barnacles at any tidal level. The extreme permutations of population characteristics range from high-level, dry barnacle areas where limpet recruitment averages 15 % of standing crop, growth rate and maximum size are low and survival for 15–17 years is possible to low-level, bare rock where input averages 66 %, growth and maximum size are high and life span unlikely to exceed 4–5 years. Population densities vary annually but the relative densities of the different habitats have remained fairly steady as long as the biological conditions have remained similar; the latter largely control the recruitment and survival characteristics upon the balance of which the population density appears to depend. Although liable to distortions due to years of abnormal recruitment, the size-frequency structure of their populations is highly diagnostic of many habitats.",,,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology,,Elsevier,"0022-0981, 1879-1697",,1975-03,1975,,1975-03,17,2,165-203,Closed,Article,"Lewis, J.R.; Bowman, Rosemary S.","Lewis, J.R.

Most studies involving benthic diatoms are still at the observational stage. Community analyses are interpreted in relation to physico-chemical variables, but without reference to the intrinsic growth characteristics of the species or to biological interactions. By allowing separate investigation of the effects of chosen variables under controlled conditions, culture studies permit field predictions to be tested and our understanding of the constraints on growth of particular species to be improved.Results of culture experiments on four benthic diatom species grown under contrasting light, temperature, and pH regimes are presented and discussed in relation to their field distributions. Synedra ulna showed a positive response to both light and temperature; Meridion circulare was more sensitive to raised water temperature at higher light intensity; Pinnularia viridis and Eunotia exigua grew over wider ranges of temperature and pH than recorded from published data. The experimental results indicate that distribution data provide only partial information on ecological range; growth in the field may be constrained by one or more factors and their interactions.Whereas analysis of field data is a correlative exercise, an experimental approach allows investigation of the physiological responses contributing to the survival of species and the demonstration of causal relationships.",,,Hydrobiologia,,Springer Nature,"1037-0544, 1573-8590, 0018-8158, 1573-5117",,1993-10,1993,,1993-10,269-270,1,447-452,Closed,Article,"Cox, Eileen J.","Cox, Eileen J.

High March CPUE was correlated with high bottom temperature in the primary nursery area (100-119 m depth) and an increase in the proportion of larvae in deeper strata. Seasonal and annual observations support Hayman and Tyler's assumption that the primary postsettlement nursery area is bathymetrically restricted. Otolith increments indicated that larvae at 50-159 m had been on the bottom longer than larvae from greater depths, suggesting postsettlement inshore migration.

However, their impacts on the fate of biogenic organic carbon in coastal oceans are not well quantified because physical and biological interactions at such features are very complex with short time- and small spatial scales variability. As part of the California Current Ecosystem Long-Term Ecological Research (CCE-LTER) Process studies in the southern California Current in October 2008, we sampled across a strong temperature and chlorophyll front (‘A-Front’) separating water masses with distinct hydrographic and biogeochemical characteristics and a modified biological assemblage at the frontal interface. Thorpe-scale analyses of the hydrographic data from a free-fall moving vessel profiler suggested an increased diapycnal diffusive nitrate flux at the front zone. Based on these field data, we use data-driven diagnostic biogeochemical models to quantify how the front-induced physical mixing influenced the production, grazing and transport of phytoplankton carbon in the southern California Current. Our results suggest that enhanced diffusive diapycnal fluxes of nutrients stimulated phytoplankton primary production at the front; this effect, together with reduced microzooplankton grazing, increased net growth of the phytoplankton community leading to locally enhanced biomass of large phytoplankton, such as diatoms, in the frontal zone.",We thank the CCE-LTER team for their support during the field work.

For example, in a monoculture of rice plants, phytotoxins were produced during the decomposition of rice residues in soil, suppressed the growth of rice seedlings, and reduced the numbers of tillers and panicles, leading to yield reduction. The allelopathic metabolites are also affected by environmental factors, such as oxygen, temperature, soil moisture, microbial activity, and levels of fertilizers in soil, and allelopathy was pronounced in areas where environmental stresses were severe. Substantial amounts of phytotoxic mimosine and phenolics were released into soil by plant parts of Leucaenaleucocephala, and these suppressed the growth of many understory species except that of L.leucocephala itself. A unique pattern of absence of understory plants was ubiquitous beneathPhyllostachys edulis, due primarily to an allelopathic effect. In a forest pasture intercropping, an aggressive kikuyu grass was planted in a deforested land where Chinese fir grew previously, to help in understanding the mechanism of biological interactions between plants. Aqueous soil leachate and extracts of the grass significantly, retarded the growth of local weeds but not that of the Chinese fir.

Stranded macroalgae exported from adjacent coastal ecosystems supports abundant intertidal consumers on oceanic sandy beaches, including talitrid amphipods, which can be one of the numerically dominant invertebrates of the upper shore. The allochthonous nature of this donor-controlled food subsidy and its unpredictable delivery by waves and currents, results in highly variable and potentially limiting resource availability for these consumers. In Chile, adults of the talitrid amphipod, Orchestoidea tuberculata Nicolet, can influence the survival of juvenile conspecifics through cannibalism, a type of intraspecific interaction we hypothesized could be affected by the availability of macroalgal resources. We experimentally investigated the potential influence of food availability on cannibalism between age classes in O. tuberculata in laboratory mesocosms. Juvenile mortality in presence of conspecific adults was significantly higher when juveniles and adults were maintained without food. However, adult mortality was neither density dependent or food dependent. Further, juveniles did not influence adult mortality, either with or without food. The strong effect of food limitation on juvenile mortality from cannibalism by adults of O. tuberculata found here, supports our hypothesis that food resource availability on beaches can affect this intraspecific interactions. In addition these results provide evidence of the potential importance of biological interaction in the population dynamics of intertidal consumers on oceanic sandy beaches.",We thank Luis Figueroa for assistance with laboratory analyses.

The existing restoration strategies usually focus on improving the environmental conditions based on the environment–saltcedar relationship, while they ignore the role of spatial autocorrelation resulting from biological interaction and ecological processes. This oversight limits the efficiency and sustainability of the restoration. Here, we explored the spatial pattern of the saltcedar population in the Yellow River Delta, China, and its relationship with environmental factors, incorporating spatial autocorrelation. The plant and soil parameters were extracted by an airborne LiDAR system integrated with fixed soil environment measurements. The environment–saltcedar relationship incorporating spatial autocorrelation was evaluated with different regression models. Results showed that saltcedars aggregated at small scales (2–6 m), resulting from intraspecific facilitation and wind dispersal of seeds, while intraspecific competition was responsible for the random distribution at large scales (>10 m). The long-distance dispersal of seeds through water explained the significant positive spatial autocorrelation of saltcedars at distances up to 125 m. Consequently, resulting from intraspecific facilitation and seed dispersal, aggregation distribution and positive spatial autocorrelation within the saltcedar population improved the adaptability of saltcedar to environmental stress and thereby reduced the impact of environmental factors on the abundance of saltcedar.",,,Sustainability,,MDPI,2071-1050,,2021-07-24,2021,2021-07-24,,13,15,8291,All OA; Gold,Article,"Jiao, Le; Zhang, Yue; Sun, Tao; Yang, Wei; Shao, Dongdong; Zhang, Peng; Liu, Qiang","Jiao, Le (); Zhang, Yue (); Sun, Tao (); Yang, Wei (); Shao, Dongdong (); Zhang, Peng (); Liu, Qiang ()",,"Jiao, Le (); Zhang, Yue (); Sun, Tao (); Yang, Wei (); Shao, Dongdong (); Zhang, Peng (); Liu, Qiang ()",,,,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China,,China,grant.8891704,U1806217,1,1,,0.46,,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/15/8291/pdf?version=1627547954,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139922438,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management,,,,,,C14 Geography and Environmental Studies,15 Life on Land

There are very few similar studies from polar systems, the shallows of which represent some of the most intensely disturbed habitats on the planet. Variability in the abundances of the five most common macrofauna was examined at three spatial scales, metres, tens of metres and hundreds of metres, in the shallows (5–25 m depth) of Adelaide Island, West Antarctic Peninsula. Whilst significant community change occurs along a depth gradient at the study sites, not all of the common species studied showed clear depth-related patterns of distribution. Furthermore, although abundance patterns varied between the organisms, consistent depth-related trends in the spatial scale contributing most to the variability were observed for four of the five species. For four species the relative importance of large-scale variability (between sites) decreased from 5 to 25 m depth, whilst small-scale variability (between replicates) increased along the depth gradient. Variation between sites is probably largely driven by ice disturbance, which becomes less frequent with depth. Conversely, small-scale patchiness is promoted by biological interactions, which become relatively more influential as community complexity and species richness increase along the depth gradient.","I thank P.

Previously we have documented the sensitivity of local richness in these assemblages to a number of regional factors including the size of the regional species pool. Here we focus on the local scale used to determine the local–regional richness relationship. We examine the sensitivity of local richness to regional richness and to two environmental variables (depth and habitat type) across a range of locality sizes. In general, local richness is sensitive to the environmental variables regardless of locality size. In contrast, it is relatively insensitive to regional richness in very small 1‐m2 quadrats but highly sensitive when sampled with 10‐m line transects. Thus our analysis suggests a spatial threshold somewhere below 10 m for the detection of regional enrichment in coral assemblages. There are four biological mechanisms that may allow regional effects to be expressed at this spatial resolution: (1) disturbance and slow recovery towards competitive equilibrium, (2) heterogeneous biological interactions involving aggregated resources, neighborhood competition, or nonrandom dispersal among local neighborhoods, (3) spatially variable predation by specialists, and (4) probabilistic recruitment coupled with equal competitive ability. Empirical tests are now needed to discriminate among these mechanisms.","A number of individuals have significantly contributed to this project.

To explore the role of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua Gadidae) in the ecosystem, we reviewed biological interactions between cod and its prey, predators and competitors within six ecosystems taken from a broad geographic range: three are cod‐capelin (Mallotus villosus Osmeridae) systems towards cod’s northern Atlantic limit (Barents Sea, Iceland and Newfoundland–Labrador), two are more diverse systems towards the southern end of the range (North Sea and Georges Bank–Gulf of Maine), and one is a species‐poor system with an unusual physical and biotic environment (Baltic Sea). We attempt a synthesis of the role of cod in these six ecosystems and speculate on how it might change in response to a variety of influences, particularly climate change, in a fashion that may apply to a wide range of species. We find cod prey, predators and competitors functionally similar in all six ecosystems. Conversely, we estimate different magnitudes for the role of cod in an ecosystem, with consequently different effects on cod, their prey and predator populations. Fishing has generally diminished the ecological role of cod. What remains unclear is how additional climate variability will alter cod stocks, and thus its role in the ecosystem.","Thanks to two anonymous referees and to the editor for their valuable comments.

In this paper, sensitivity analysis and comparison of model predictions to field observations identified conditions under which a subtropical to tropical seagrass ecosystem model would be a useful management tool. Sensitivity analysis indicated that under low‐nutrient conditions, physical factors such as temperature, light, and salinity controlled model predictions of seagrass and epiphyte biomass, but that when nutrients were abundant (5 μmol/L sediment pore water P; 10 μmol/L water column P) control shifted to biological interactions. This analysis suggests that important areas for future research include formulations for biomass‐dependent productivity (e.g., competition for nutrients or light) and the effects of altered nutrients on epiphyte productivity and shading. Model predictions matched the seasonal abundance of seagrasses measured in three distinct seagrass communities in Biscayne Bay, Florida, suggesting that in its present form the model could be useful to managers to run “what‐if” scenarios in order to make long‐term decisions about upstream water management practices, including allowable nutrients and freshwater diversion. These management decisions are currently being considered without the benefit of a model.","This research was funded, in part, by National Science Foundation grant number OCE‐9‐00649 to the University of Miami.

In subtropical systems influenced by seasonal monsoons, seasonal cycle of plankton communities could be disrupted and restructured by short but intense weather events. Our survey of a shallow subtropical embayment to the northern part of the South China Sea demonstrated temporal variations in zooplankton biomass and composition between monsoon periods: not only were the wet (summer monsoon) and dry (winter monsoon) periods distinctive from each other, but also the transition phase between the two. The meroplankton communities were distinct between the monsoon periods with fish, decapods and echinoderm peaked during the wet season and cirripedia bloomed in dry season. This pattern can be attributed to both changes in growth conditions and influx of individuals through monsoon-driven water currents. The community shift during the transitional phase, defined by the rapid changes in salinity and temperature, corresponded to the reported reproductive cycles of marine organisms, including commercially important fishes, crustaceans, and echinoderms. The interannual variability observed during the wet period reflected changes in rainfall between consecutive years, highlighting the importance of having a long time series with which to establish a baseline information to better manage nursery habitats like the one surveyed, particularly in light of increasing coastal development. Subtropical coastal zooplankton communities are highly dynamic with multiple pulses and interruptions driven by weather events.","Funding of this project is provided by the Environment and Conservation Fund (ECF 09/2015) to KC and CY.

Four age classes were identified. This species recruits once a year, during summer. In general, the recruits (< 2.5 mm) represented a small percentage of the total population. The growth rate of H. australis declined with increasing animal size and showed a marked seasonal pattern for the population under study: lower rate during winter and higher rate in summer. A life cycle of approximately 30 months (~2.5 years) was estimated for the population of H. australis in the Bahía Blanca estuary. This population shows variations in growth rate, abundance of recruits, and shell size in relation to more northerly populations. Several factors like parasitism, predation, environmental features, and anthropogenic action may be interacting to produce these differences. This work constitutes the first long-term study of the life cycle of cochliopids. Heleobia australis appears to be a long-lived species and exhibits variations in its life cycle that seem to be influenced by biological and physical variables.

We quantified patterns of plant species diversity on transects across elevation at 59 salt marsh sites in Georgia and 49 sites in Texas. Although these regions have similar climates and floras, we anticipated that diversity might differ because of differences in tidal regime. Diversity was measured at global, regional, site, and plot scales to consider processes occurring at all levels. Species pools were similar between regions. Texas had greater diversity at the site and plot scales, suggesting that processes occurring at the site scale differed. The greater diversity of Texas sites and plots was associated with wider distributions of individual species across the marsh landscape and proportionally more middle marsh (a high diversity zone) and less low marsh (a low diversity zone) than in Georgia marshes. Preliminary data suggested that these differences were not due to differences in salinity regime or standing biomass between regions, leaving differences in tidal regime as the most plausible hypothesis accounting for differences in plant diversity. We speculate that the less-predictable tidal regime in Texas leads to temporal variation in abiotic conditions that limit the ability of any one species to competitively exclude others from particular marsh zones.","We thank the Environmental Institute of Houston for funding, Nadia Deeb for her help with field work and data entry, Wade Sheldon, John Carpenter, Betsy Terrel, and Dawn Kaufman for assistance, and Ricardo Azevedo, Paul Harcombe, Emily Marquardt, and Michael Travisano for helpful comments on the work and manuscript.

DCA proved to be highly sensitive to differences among samples and consistently provided ecologically meaningful species ordinations.Seasonality of taxa was the major gradient displayed by DCA prior to copper exposure when data for all sampling dates were included. Sensitivity of taxa to copper was a more important factor affecting community structure than was seasonality during periods of continuous exposure to copper (2.5 to 15 µg l-1 CuT; approximately 12 to 75 ng l-1 Cu2+. When pre-dose data for each sampling date were ordinated independently, substratum composition and biological interactions were the major gradients displayed in species ordinations. During periods of exposure, sensitivity of taxa to copper was the primary gradient. This gradient also reflected a generally greater sensitivity to copper of herbivorous than of detritivorous or predatory benthic insects. DCA revealed the persistence, eleven months after dosing ceased, of differences in community structure between the control and high treatment (5 and 10 µg l-1 CuT) sections.

600,pub.1027296244,10.2517/prpsj.8.99,,,,Snails versus hermit crabs: a new interpretation on shell-peeling predation in fossil gastropod assemblages,"We propose two new methods, an endobiont method and a model method, to quantitatively evaluate shell-peeling predation against snails and hermit crabs in fossil gastropod assemblages. The endobiont method, based on the frequency of peeled and pagurized shells, provides the minimum and maximum estimates of predation against hermit crabs. The model method, based on the frequency distribution of shell repairs per shell in peeled and unpeeled shells, estimates directly the frequencies of predation against hermit crabs and snails. Our two methods were applied to a deep-water gastropod assemblage from the Pliocene Shinzato Formation, Okinawa, Japan. Results show that peeling predation, irrespective of the high frequency of repaired breaks (thought to be an indication of high predatory attacks on snails in previous studies), is mostly attributable to hermit crabs rather than to snails in elongate shells, whereas it is the reverse in spherical shells. The results suggest that the frequency of repaired breaks is strongly controlled by the abundance of elongate shells in fossil gastropod assemblages, and that the increasing evidence of peeling predation, irrespective of predation pressure, is also caused by the increase of elongate shells (e.g., caenogastropods) in gastropod assemblages since the mid-Mesozoic.

In particular, the influence of two environmental factors that are changing in many VB arid lands (rainfall and grazing pressures) is studied. Three rainfall regimes (representing 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 times the long-term rainfall average), five grazing intensities, two types (reversible and irreversible) of grazing disturbance, two grazing periodicities (chronic and pulse), two levels of grass colonization ability, positive and negative interactions between shrubs and grasses, and the efficiency of endozoochorous seed dispersal are simulated.The results show that the permanence of undisturbed VB depends on the interaction of two factors, rainfall regime and grass colonization ability. Type and intensity of grazing also modify VB cover and permanence; furthermore, long-term overgrazing may convert mixed grass/shrub plant communities to pure scrublands dominated by endozoochorous-dispersed shrubs due to competitive interactions between shrubs and grasses.Besides providing an adequate representation of the system’s dynamics, the model is a useful tool that may be used to explore the consequences of climate change on management scenarios.","The authors would like to thank M.

587,pub.1141345464,10.3897/biss.5.75636,,,,Plant-pollinator Vocabulary - a Contribution to Interaction Data Standardization,"Human demands on resources such as food and energy are increasing through time while global challenges such as climate change and biodiversity loss are becoming more complex to overcome, as well as more widely acknowledged by societies and governments. Reports from initiatives like the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) have demanded quick and reliable access to high-quality spatial and temporal data of species occurrences, their interspecific relations and the effects of the environment on biotic interactions. Mapping species interactions is crucial to understanding and conserving ecosystem functioning and all the services it can provide (Tylianakis et al. 2010, Slade et al. 2017). Detailed data has the potential to improve our knowledge about ecological and evolutionary processes guided by interspecific interactions, as well as to assist in planning and decision making for biodiversity conservation and restoration (Menz et al. 2011). Although a great effort has been made to successfully standardize and aggregate species occurrence data, a formal standard to support biotic interaction data sharing and interoperability is still lacking. There are different biological interactions that can be studied, such as predator-prey, host-parasite and pollinator-plant and there is a variety of data practices and data representation procedures that can be used. Plant-pollinator interactions are recognized in many sources from the scientific literature (Abrol 2012, Ollerton 2021) for the importance of ecosystem functioning and sustainable agriculture. Primary data about pollination are becoming increasingly available online and can be accessed from a great number of data repositories. While a vast quantity of data on interactions, and on pollination in particular, is available, data are not integrated among sources, largely because of a lack of appropriate standards. We present a vocabulary of terms for sharing plant-pollinator interactions using one of the existing extensions to the Darwin Core standard (Wieczorek et al. 2012). In particular, the vocabulary is meant to be used for the term measurementType of the Extended Measurement Or Facts extension. The vocabulary was developed by a community of specialists in pollination biology and information science, including members of the TDWG Biological Interaction Data Interest Group, during almost four years of collaborative work. The vocabulary introduces 40 new terms, comprising many aspects of plant-pollinator interactions, and can be used to capture information produced by studies with different approaches and scales. The plant-pollinator interactions vocabulary is mainly a set of terms that can be both understood by people or interpreted by machines. The plant-pollinator vocabulary is composed of a defining a set of terms and descriptive documents explaining how the vocabulary is to be used. The terms in the vocabulary are divided into six categories: Animal, Plants, Flower, Interaction, Reproductive Success and Nectar Dynamics. The categories are not formally part of the vocabulary, they are used only to organize the vocabulary and to facilitate understanding by humans. We expect that the plant-pollinator vocabulary will contribute to data aggregation from a variety of sources worldwide at higher levels than we have experienced, significantly amplify plant-pollinator data availability for global synthesis, and contribute to knowledge in conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.",,,Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,,Pensoft Publishers,2535-0897,,2021-09-23,2021,2021-09-23,,5,,e75636,All OA; Gold,Article,"Salim, José Augusto; Zermoglio, Paula F; Drucker, Debora P; Soares, Filipi Miranda; Saraiva, Antonio Mauro; Agostini, Kayna; Freitas, Leandro; Wolowski, Marina; Rech, André R; Maués, Marcia M; Varassin, Isabela G","Salim, José Augusto (Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil; University of Sao Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil, University of Sao Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil); Zermoglio, Paula F (VertNet, Bariloche, Argentina, VertNet, Bariloche, Argentina); Drucker, Debora P (Embrapa Informática Agropecuária, Campinas, Brazil, Embrapa Informática Agropecuária, Campinas, Brazil); Soares, Filipi Miranda (University of Sao Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil, University of Sao Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil); Saraiva, Antonio Mauro (University of Sao Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil, University of Sao Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil); Agostini, Kayna (Universidade Federal de São Carlos, Araras, Brazil, Universidade Federal de São Carlos, Araras, Brazil); Freitas, Leandro (Jardim Botânico do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Jardim Botânico do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); Wolowski, Marina (Universidade Federal de Alfenas, Alfenas, Brazil, Universidade Federal de Alfenas, Alfenas, Brazil); Rech, André R (Universidade Federal dos Vales do Jequitinhonha e Mucuri, Diamantina, Brazil, Universidade Federal dos Vales do Jequitinhonha e Mucuri, Diamantina, Brazil); Maués, Marcia M (Embrapa Amazônia Oriental, Belém, Brazil, Embrapa Amazônia Oriental, Belém, Brazil); Varassin, Isabela G (Universidade Federal do Paraná, Curitiba, Brazil, Universidade Federal do Paraná, Curitiba, Brazil)","Salim, José Augusto (Universidade de São Paulo; Universidade de São Paulo)","Salim, José Augusto (Universidade de São Paulo; Universidade de São Paulo); Zermoglio, Paula F (); Drucker, Debora P (Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation); Soares, Filipi Miranda (Universidade de São Paulo); Saraiva, Antonio Mauro (Universidade de São Paulo); Agostini, Kayna (Federal University of São Carlos); Freitas, Leandro (Instituto de Pesquisas Jardim Botânico do Rio de Janeiro); Wolowski, Marina (Federal University of Alfenas); Rech, André R (Universidade Federal dos Vales do Jequitinhonha e Mucuri); Maués, Marcia M (Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation); Varassin, Isabela G (Federal University of Paraná)",Universidade Federal dos Vales do Jequitinhonha e Mucuri; Federal University of Paraná; Instituto de Pesquisas Jardim Botânico do Rio de Janeiro; Federal University of Alfenas; Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation; Federal University of São Carlos; Universidade de São Paulo,grid.411287.9; grid.20736.30; grid.452542.0; grid.411180.d; grid.460200.0; grid.411247.5; grid.11899.38,Diamantina; Curitiba; Rio de Janeiro; Alfenas; Brasília; São Carlos; São Paulo,; Paraná; ; ; ; ; ,Brazil; Brazil; Brazil; Brazil; Brazil; Brazil; Brazil,,,,,,1,1,,0.4,5,https://biss.pensoft.net/article/75636/download/pdf/,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141345464,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4101 Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation,,,,,,A05 Biological Sciences,
587,pub.1103459958,10.1111/btp.12555,,,,Host plant distributions and climate interact to affect the predicted geographic distribution of a Neotropical termite,"Species distribution models (SDMs) have been widely used in the scientific literature. The majority of SDMs use climate data or other abiotic variables to forecast the potential distribution of a species in geographic space. Biotic interactions can affect the predicted spatial distribution of a species in many ways across multiple spatial scales, and incorporating these predictors in an SDM is a current topic in the scientific literature. Constrictotermes cyphergaster is a widely distributed termite in the Neotropics. This termite species nests in plants and more frequently nests in some arboreal species. Thus, this species is an excellent model to evaluate the influence of biotic interactions in SDMs. We evaluate the influences of climate and the geographic distribution of host plants on the potential distribution of C. cyphergaster. Three correlative models (MaxEnt) were built to predict the geographic distribution of the termite: (1) climate data, (2) biotic data (i.e., the geographic distribution of host plants), and (3) climate and biotic data. The models that were generated indicate that the potential geographic distribution of C. cyphergaster is concentrated in the Cerrado and Caatinga regions. In addition, path analysis and multiple regression revealed the importance of the direct effects of biological interactions in the geographic distribution of the termite, while climate affected the distribution of the termite mainly through indirect effects by influencing the geographic distributions of host plants. The current study endorses the importance of including biological interactions in SDMs. We recommend using biotic predictors in SDM studies of insect species, mainly because insects have important environmental services and biotic interaction data can improve the macroecological studies of this group. Os modelos de distribuição de espécies (SDMs) têm sido amplamente utilizados na literatura científica. A maioria dos SDMs usa dados climáticos ou outras variáveis abióticas para predizer a distribuição potencial de uma espécie no espaço geográfico. Interações bióticas podem afetar a distribuição espacial predita de uma espécie de várias maneiras em múltiplas escalas espaciais, incorporar esses preditores em um SDM é um tópico atual. Constrictotermes cyphergaster é uma espécie de cupim com ampla distribuição no Neotropico. Esta espécie nidifica em espécies de plantas, principalmente de porte arbóreo. Assim, esta espécie é um excelente modelo para avaliar a influência das interações bióticas em SDMs. Avaliamos a influência do clima e da distribuição geográfica das plantas hospedeiras sobre a distribuição potencial de C. cyphergaster. Três modelos correlativos (MaxEnt) foram construídos para predizer a distribuição geográfica do cupim: (1) dados climáticos, (2) dados bióticos (ou seja, a distribuição geográfica das plantas hospedeiras) e (3) dados climáticos e bióticos. Os modelos que foram gerados indicam que a distribuição geográfica potencial de C. cyphergaster está concentrada no Cerrado e na Caatinga. Além disso, a análise de caminho e a regressão múltipla revelaram a importância dos efeitos diretos das interações biológicas na distribuição geográfica dos cupins, enquanto o clima afetou a distribuição do cupim principalmente através de efeitos indiretos influenciando a distribuição geográfica das plantas hospedeiras. O presente estudo confirma a importância de incluir interações bióticas em SDMs. Recomendamos o uso de preditores bióticos em estudos SDM de espécies de insetos, principalmente porque os insetos prestam serviços ambientais importantes e os dados de interação biótica podem melhorar os estudos macroecológicos deste grupo.","We thank the anonymous reviewer and Dr. Amanda Zellmer for criticisms that improved the manuscript.

Diverse soil microorganisms form a complex assembly and play an important role in agroecosystems by regulating nutrient cycling, promoting plant growth, and alleviating biotic and abiotic stresses. Improving microbial coexistence may be an effective and practical solution for the promotion of soil–plant ecosystem health in the face of the impacts of anthropogenic activities and global climate change. Modern coexistence theory is a useful theoretical framework for studying the coexistence of species that are competing for resources. Here, we briefly introduce the basic framework of modern coexistence theory, including the theoretical definitions and mathematical calculations for niche difference and fitness difference, as well as ways to test for these differences empirically. The possible effects of several major biotic and abiotic factors, such as biological interactions, climate change, environmental stress, and fertilization, on microbial niche and fitness differences are discussed. From the perspective of stabilizing and equalizing mechanisms, the potential roles of microbe–microbe interactions and plant–microbe interactions in promoting healthy soil–microbe–plant continuum are presented. We suggest that the use of the coexistence theory framework for the design and construction of microbial communities in agricultural production can provide a solid basis for the biological improvement of agroecosystems.",,,Biology and Fertility of Soils,,Springer Nature,"0178-2762, 1432-0789",,2021-08-27,2021,2021-08-27,2021-10,57,7,897-911,All OA; Green,Article,"Zhang, Na; Nunan, Naoise; Hirsch, Penny R.; Sun, Bo; Zhou, Jizhong; Liang, Yuting","Zhang, Na (State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, No. 71 East Beijing Road, 210008, Nanjing, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, No.19A Yuquan Road, 100049, Beijing, China); Nunan, Naoise (CNRS, IRD, INRA, P7, UPEC, Institute of Ecology and Environmental Sciences—Paris, Sorbonne Université, 4 place Jussieu, 75005, Paris, France; Department of Soil and Environment, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, 75007, Uppsala, Sweden); Hirsch, Penny R.

584,pub.1043312622,10.1007/s10980-009-9416-y,,,,Measuring edge contrast using biotic criteria helps define edge effects on the density of an invasive plant,"Habitat edges can alter population dynamics, influence community structure, determine the success of conservation efforts, and facilitate the spread of invasive species. Despite recognition that edges influence the nature and strength of ecological interactions, edges are generally characterized using abiotic measures that likely capture habitat quality for only the focal taxa, and ignore the potential for biotic interactions to explain edge effects. Here we describe the association between edges and the density of an invasive shrub, Lonicera maackii, and infer the functional role of edges by using multiple criteria to weight edge contrast. We define edge contrast using both an abiotic criterion in which contrast is weighted by differences in light availability, and a biotic criterion in which edge contrast is weighted by the association between edges and the abundance of the American Robin (Turdus migratorius), an important avian seed disperser. Biotically defining edge contrast significantly improved model fit in all cases, demonstrating that the large-scale distribution of an invasive shrub is best predicted using both abiotic and biotic edge characterization. More generally, our work suggests that weighting edge contrast using key biological interactions in addition to abiotic criteria may be a promising way to understand the multiple pathways by which edges influence the distribution and abundance of organisms.","We thank Amy Conley and Kaity Mattos for assistance in the field, and Rob Fletcher and members of the Orrock lab for comments that helped improve the manuscript.

584,pub.1028286046,10.1007/s10144-004-0184-x,,,,Spatial hierarchical approach in community ecology: a way beyond high context‐dependency and low predictability in local phenomena,"Patterns and functioning of communities, which are determined by a set of processes operating at a large variety of spatial and temporal scales, exhibit quite high context‐dependency and low predictability at the fine spatial scales at which recent studies have concentrated. More attention to broader scale and across‐scale phenomena may be useful to search for general patterns and rules in communities. In this context, it is effective to incorporate hierarchical spatial scale explicitly into the experimental and sampling design of field studies, an approach referred to here as the spatial hierarchical approach, focusing on a particular assemblage in which biological interaction and species life history are well known. The spatial hierarchical approach can provide insight into the effects of scale in operating processes and answers to a number of important questions in community ecology such as: (1) detection of patterns and processes in spatiotemporal variability in communities, including how to explain the partitioning of pattern information of species diversity at a broad scale into finer scales, and the pattern of spatial variability of community properties at the finest spatial scale; (2) evaluation of changes in patterns observed in macroecology at finer scales; (3) testing of models explaining the coexistence of competing species; and (4) detection of latitudinal patterns in spatiotemporal variability in communities and their causal processes.","I would like to thank M.

This work propounds the possibility that C. atlantica and Pinus nigra could have co-habited in the past, mutually excluding each other in the areas with suitable conditions for both species, where, ultimately, the one that was the most competitive would have remained. The niche overlap in the two-dimensional ecological space was analyzed. In addition, the potential distribution of both species in the Western Mediterranean today and two past periods (Last Glacial Maximum and Mid-Holocene) was modeled to identify their common geographic area of distribution. The species showed very well differentiated niches and a distribution of their habitats virtually segregated by continents since the Mid-Holocene (P. nigra in Europe and C. atlantica in Africa), which responds to differences in climatic affinities. However, the contact of the bordering areas of their distributions in the Baetic mountain range suggests that C. atlantica could have maintained its presence in the Iberian Peninsula until recent times. P. nigra would have displace it in later stages due to its greater prevalence on the continent, so it would have had greater opportunities to occupy the available space.",,"This research study was funded by (i) the Spanish government, State R&D Program Oriented to the Challenges of the Society, MED-REFUGIA Research Project (RTI2018-101714-B-I00); (ii) Andalusian Plan for Research, Development and Innovation, OROMEDREFUGIA Research Project (P18-RT-4963); (iii) ERDF Operational Programme in Andalusia (EU regional programme), RELIC-FLORA 2 Research Project (B-RNM-404-UGR18); and (iv) State Program for the Promotion of Scientific Research and Excellence Technique, PALEOPINSAPO Research Project (CSO2017-83576-P).

Recent modeling results suggest that oceanic oxygen levels will decrease significantly over the next decades to centuries in response to climate change and altered ocean circulation. Hence, the future ocean may experience major shifts in nutrient cycling triggered by the expansion and intensification of tropical oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), which are connected to the most productive upwelling systems in the ocean. There are numerous feedbacks among oxygen concentrations, nutrient cycling and biological productivity; however, existing knowledge is insufficient to understand physical, chemical and biological interactions in order to adequately assess past and potential future changes. In the following, we summarize one decade of research performed in the framework of the Collaborative Research Center 754 (SFB754) focusing on climate–biogeochemistry interactions in tropical OMZs. We investigated the influence of low environmental oxygen conditions on biogeochemical cycles, organic matter formation and remineralization, greenhouse gas production and the ecology in OMZ regions of the eastern tropical South Pacific compared to the weaker OMZ of the eastern tropical North Atlantic. Based on our findings, a coupling of primary production and organic matter export via the nitrogen cycle is proposed, which may, however, be impacted by several additional factors, e.g., micronutrients, particles acting as microniches, vertical and horizontal transport of organic material and the role of zooplankton and viruses therein.","We thank IMARPE and INDP for close collaboration and support.

Standard plot sizes of 400m2 were recommended in order to compare the α-diversity between different ecosystem types.For the application of diversity aspects in landscape management, further attributes of the species composition should be considered. The state of the regional and phytocoenological species pool and the relationship between autochthonous and allochthonous species may help to describe the importance and potential risks of biological invasions. Life strategy types reflect the interactions between species trade-offs and environmental constraints. The species preferences for different hemerobic steps may be used as indicators of human impacts especially in agricultural and urban landscapes and ecological indication values for different site qualities. These attributes in combination may help to characterize ecosystem properties and to develop scenarios for succession processes.Biodiversity in its different aspects can only be successfully sustained, if the multitude of biological interactions with the human way of life in and subsiding on ecosystems are considered. The approach of the convention of biodiversity (CBD) based on the ‘Malawi Principles’ focus on the functional relationships and processes within ecosystems and propagates the use of adaptive management practices at scales appropriate for the issues being addressed. The principles take into account the need for integrative cooperation. A regional application of these principles is necessary for sustainable landscape planning.","I am much indebted to Christian Dolnik and Felix Müller for valuable suggestions concerning a former version of this paper, to two anonymous reviewers for friendly and helpful advises and to Candy Music for polishing the English text.",,Ecological Indicators,,Elsevier,"1470-160X, 1872-7034",,2006-01,2006,,2006-01,6,1,94-103,Closed,Article,"Dierssen, Klaus","Dierssen, Klaus (Ecology Centre, Department of Geobotany, Olshausenstr. 75, D–24 118 Kiel, Germany)",,"Dierssen, Klaus ()",,,,,,,,,,,29,0,,2.23,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1046779849,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4102 Ecological Applications; 4104 Environmental Management,,,,,,C14 Geography and Environmental Studies,14 Life Below Water; 15 Life on Land

Model equations describe the interactions of doliolids with two phytoplankton size fractions, five copepod developmental states and detrital pool. Additional equations describe nitrate and ammonia. Model dynamics are based primarily upon data obtained from field and laboratory experiments for southeastern US continental shelf plankton populations. Variations on a reference simulation, which represents average upwelling conditions without doliolids, were carried out to determine the effect of inclusion of doliolids, temperature and nutrient variations, and variations in ambient food concentrations on the basic plankton community structure. These simulations provide a measure of the role of environmental versus biological interactions in structuring the planktonic food web on the southeastern US continental shelf. Simulations show that he copepod population is significantly reduce when doliolids are present. This happens primarily as a result of direct predation of the doliolids on copepod eggs and juveniles as opposed to an increase in competition for phytoplankton, the primary food source. Additional simulations show that the cooler temperatures associated with the newly upwelled water temporarily decrease the growth rates of doliolids and copepods, bestowing an event greater advantage on the rapidly reproducing doliolids.",,,Journal of Plankton Research,,Oxford University Press (OUP),"0142-7873, 1464-3774, 14643774",,1999-09-01,1999,,1999-09-01,21,9,1725-1752,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Haskell, A","Haskell, A ()",,"Haskell, A ()",,,,,,,,,,,11,4,,,3,https://academic.oup.com/plankt/article-pdf/21/9/1725/9913171/211725.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1023207485,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 37 Earth Sciences,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,

In March 1994 a dense bloom developed within St Helena Bay. Its subsequent decay caused near-shore hypoxia and elevated hydrogen sulphide levels, leading to it being termed a ‘black tide’. The bloom caused immediate massive intertidal mortalities (95% reduction of biomass), significant changes in community structure, and declines in richness and diversity. Only four taxa were not diminished: ephemeral algae, the gastropod Afrolittorina knysnaensis, the anemone Bunodactis reynaudi and the false limpet Siphonaria capensis. This limpet species subsequently increased at impacted sites relative to controls, probably reflecting reduced competition from other grazers. Ephemeral algae flourished during early recolonisation while grazers were depleted, but declined as grazers re-established. Manipulative experiments demonstrated that grazers do have this capability. Perennial algae also flourished, but lagged behind ephemerals, possibly contributing to their decline. Predators took longest to recover. Differences in the responses of species reflect differing tolerances, zonation patterns and biological interactions. Communities at control sites remained unchanged over the four-year study, and those exposed to a low intensity of the bloom were little affected, but communities exposed to its full intensity failed to recover fully within four years. Increasing frequency of harmful algal blooms along the west coast of South Africa could, therefore, significantly alter rocky-shore communities if intervals between bloom events become shorter than recovery times.","This research was funded by the National Research Foundation, the University of Cape Town and the Andrew Mellon Foundation.

The registration of plant species in green and landscaped areas of the campus in which the presence of syrphid eggs, larvae, pupae or adults on their flowers has been observed, has allowed us to establish a network of biological interactions syrphid-plant on the university campus. The results suggest that the biodiversity of wild, ruderal or spontaneous plants growing on the campus, some of which are considered weeds, favors the maintenance of syrphid populations.

Understanding the mechanisms of how habitat degradation drives changes in spatial patterns of species assemblages is fundamental to conservation science. We conducted an empirical study to investigate the species richness (α-diversity) and community composition (β-diversity) of benthopelagic biota along the gradient of human modification in West Dongting Lake, China. The study site is a large floodplain lake that has been subjected to long-term intensive human use. For a better understanding of how β-diversity responds to human disturbance, we also distinguished between two patterns of β-diversity, i.e., turnover and nestedness. We found that both α- and β-diversity of the benthopelagic assemblage decreased along the intensity gradient of human modification, indicating the strong homogenizing effect of anthropogenic habitat alternation. Our results also suggested that multiple processes, including environmental filtering, dispersal limitation, and biological interactions, were important in shaping the benthopelagic assemblage structure because spatial turnover other than nestedness dominated the total β-diversity at both the lake and habitat level. These findings support that habitat restoration by removing artificial banks and channels and increasing the landscape naturalness would be the key for this highly modified floodplain lake.","We would like to thank the staff at the West Dongting Lake National Nature Reserve and Xiao Yayu, Zhao Changbin, and Guo Min for their help in data collection.

However, most experimental biological communities employed so far had quite simple structures. Therefore, the possibility that the conclusions in earlier studies were dependent on simple community structure is undeniable. In this study, using a multiple‐species experimental community, we evaluated which combinations of component species and what kinds of interspecific interactions allow communities to persist and how these contribute to community persistence. We conducted experimental communities using two species of beans, the adzuki bean (Vigna angularis) and the red kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), two species of bean weevils, the Mexican bean weevil (Zabrotes subfasciatus, Coleoptera: Bruchidae) and adzuki bean weevil (Callosobruchus chinensis, Coleoptera: Bruchidae), and two species of parasitic wasp, Heterospilus prosopidis (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) and Anisopteromalus calandrae (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae). The outcome of multiple‐generation experimental communities was explained by the characteristics of component species obtained from short‐term experiments. In our two resources–two herbivores–one carnivore system, the strong density‐dependent attack ability of one parasitic wasp species (A. calandrae) led to the extinction of C. chinensis. On the other hand, the weak density‐dependent attack ability of the other parasitic wasp species (H. prosopidis) led to system persistence. Our overall results show that, in a multiple‐species community, the combination of species itself is more important for community persistence than are the characteristics of the particular species.",,,Population Ecology,,Wiley,"1438-3896, 1438-390X",,1999-08,1999,2018-11-29,1999-08,41,2,127-134,Closed,Article,"Mitsunaga, T.; Fujii, Koichi","Mitsunaga, T.

583,pub.1029599239,10.1007/bf00006307,,,,The basis of fish community structure: marine and freshwater comparisons,"SynopsisFreshwater and marine fish communities are described and compared for arctic, boreal and tropical latitudes. Details of habitat characteristics, species numbers, and diel and seasonal differences in distribution are given for each community type. The order of increasing richness of fish species in these environments is (1) arctic lakes, (2) arctic marine, (3) boreal lakes, (4) tropical lakes, (5) boreal marine and (6) tropical marine. The richness of numbers of species can be related to a series of factors, each of which may function at some threshold value. These factors include climatic perturbation, solar radiation, spatial heterogeneity, available nutrient supply, availability of cover, and geological time. Discontinuities in the availability of some factors can be partially compensated for by torpor or aestivation; this effectively removes the fish from the community for a period of time. Increased diversity may also be effected through the diurnal/nocturnal shift in activity in some fish communities.The development of an organic matrix, notably macrophyte beds or coral reefs, may contribute significantly to an increase in diversity within fish communities. This matrix operates by an increase in spatial heterogeneity and in biological interactions. The apparent lack of resilience of high diversity fish communities can be related to the characteristics of the underlying organic matrix. A change in the matrix will cause a change in the level of fish diversity that can be maintained in the system.",,,Environmental Biology of Fishes,,Springer Nature,"0378-1909, 1573-5133",,1978-03,1978,,1978-03,3,1,33-47,Closed,Article,"Emery, Alan R.","Emery, Alan R.

However, gaining basic dispersal information is a critical step for understanding species’ geographical distributions and for predicting the likely impacts of future climate change. Dispersal mechanisms can indicate short‐ or long‐distance dispersers, and highlight important biological interactions. 2. To predict dispersal mechanisms for species where information is limited, we used generalized linear mixed models with basic life‐history and ecological traits. Sets of models were created (using Australian species) for six dispersal categories: wind, unassisted, water, ant, vertebrate‐ingestion and vertebrate‐attachment dispersal mechanisms. We validated our models on the dispersal mechanisms of 50 Australian, 30 Californian, 30 Swiss plant species and a global compilation of 70 species. 3. Growth form, seed mass and vegetation type were the main predictor variables. Our models predicted dispersal mechanisms for Australian and Californian plant species equally well (c. 70% correct) and to a lesser extent for the Swiss flora (c. 50% correct). Our models predicted observed dispersal mechanisms (c. 50% correct) equally well to inferred dispersal mechanisms (based on seed morphology). 4. Synthesis. Our approach of using easily obtainable traits for predicting dispersal mechanisms of species allows dispersal information to be predicted for species where little is known. From here, the application of realistic dispersal curves to the predicted dispersal mechanisms will further understanding on the dispersal capabilities of species.","We thank Mark Westoby, Barbara Rice, and from the Sydney Royal Botanic Gardens Doug Benson, Lotte von Richter, Cathy Offord and Amelia Martyn for seed mass and dispersal data.

583,pub.1084395786,10.2216/16-92.1,,,,The floating Sargassum (Phaeophyceae) of the South Atlantic Ocean – likely scenarios,"This study represents the efforts of a network of researchers to characterise the large, floating Sargassum (Fucales, Phaeophyceae) biomass that had reached the Brazilian coast in 2014 and 2015. Material collected during these events was identified as Sargassum natans and S. fluitans using morphological characteristics; ITS2 sequences showed low divergence (0%–3%) with sequences of nine other Sargassum species. Several epiphytic macroalgae, invertebrates and fishes were associated with the floating Sargassum. Satellite images did not support the hypothesis of slicks moving south from the Sargasso Sea in the northern Atlantic Ocean. This strengthens the hypothesis that there is a matrix of pelagic Sargassum in the central Atlantic Ocean and that biomass accumulation should be considered a result of the combination of physicochemical seawater conditions and biological interactions. The biomass accumulation of the stranded Sargassum was estimated during four events, peaking in 98 kg m−2 wet weight on a beach on the Amazonian coast. The landing of huge Sargassum biomass represents a potential source of environmental stress, as it can lead to an increase in oxygen demand and eventually synthesise and release chemical compounds with allelopathic properties. On the other hand, these floating islands are a fundamental element of the biogeography and macroecology of tropical environments in the Atlantic Ocean, providing connectivity south/north and east/west among marine biodiversity from Atlantic reef environments. Studies concerning Sargassum effects on local communities are necessary for the proper management of this phenomenon.","Financial support was provided by CNPQ (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development) (PROSPECMAR 458548/2013-8).

583,pub.1025404348,10.1007/bf00138906,,,,Quaternary landscape ecology: Relevant scales in space and time,"Two primary goals of landscape ecologists are to (1) evaluate changes in ecological pattern and process on natural landscapes through time and (2) determine the ecological consequences of transforming natural land-scapes to cultural ones. Paleoecological techniques can be used to reconstruct past landscapes and their changes through time; use of paleoecological methods of investigation in combination with geomorphic and paleoethnobiological data, historical records, and shorter-term ecological data sets makes it possible to integrate long-term ecological pattern and process on a nested series of temporal and spatial scales. ‘Natural experiments’ of the past can be used to test alternative hypotheses about the relative influences of environmental change, biological interactions, and human activities in structuring biotic communities within landscape mosaics.On the absolute time scale of the Quaternary Period, spanning the past 1.8 million years, current distributional ranges of the biota have taken shape and modern biotic communities have assembled. Quaternary environmental changes have influenced the development of natural landscapes over time scales of centuries to hundreds of thousands of years; human cultural evolution has resulted in the transformation of much of the biosphere from natural to cultural landscapes over the past 5,000 years. The Quaternary extends to and includes the present and the immediate future.

A reduction in discharge is accompanied by abiotic changes in benthic and hyporheic habitats, often including reductions in habitat availability. Whilst the benthic invertebrate community response to low flows is well documented, little research has considered how the composition of the community within the hyporheic zone is affected. We examined benthic and hyporheic invertebrate community composition during flow recession in a temperate karst stream, at sites with contrasting historic flow permanence regimes. Changes in benthic invertebrate community composition primarily reflected changes in habitat availability associated with discharge variability; in particular, the population density of the dominant amphipod, Gammarus pulex, increased as the area of submerged benthic sediments declined. Concurrent significant increases in the hyporheic abundance of G. pulex, and moderate increase in the proportion of the total G. pulex population inhabiting the hyporheic zone were recorded. It is postulated that G. pulex migrated into the hyporheic zone to reduce exposure to intensifying biological interactions in the benthic sediments. An increase in the hyporheic abundance of G. pulex was particularly pronounced at sites with historic intermittent flow, which could be attributed to downwelling stream water dominating vertical hydrologic exchange. The increase in G. pulex abundance reduced community diversity in the benthic sediments, but had no apparent detrimental effects on hyporheic invertebrate assemblages.

Galerucella grisescens (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) is usually associated with Polygonaceae in Japan but a population feeding on an invasive plant species Myriophyllum aquaticum (Haloragaceae) was found in Chiba Prefecture, Honshu. To infer the process of host range expansion and possible rapid adaptations of G. grisescens to M. aquaticum, we studied larval host plant suitability and female oviposition site preference by G. grisescens in different strains. In laboratory rearing experiments, adult body weight and egg mass size of G. grisescens were smaller on M. aquaticum than on the native host Persicaria lapathifolia (Polygonaceae), suggesting that Polygonaceae are more suitable hosts for G. grisescens than M. aquaticum. On M. aquaticum, the larval survival rate was significantly higher in the Chiba strain collected from M. aquaticum than in the Saga strain originating from Polygonaceae. This raises the possibility that the Chiba strain rapidly adapted to M. aquaticum and improved survival rate on the plant. Oviposition site preference of G. grisescens females was slightly different between individuals reared on Polygonaceae and M. aquaticum. These results suggest that G. grisescens represents early stages of ecological adaptation to the introduced plant and it is a possible biological control agent against M. aquaticum.",This study was supported in part by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 26870435 to MT.

Experimental cores, equipped with windows allowing infaunal colonisation, were filled with defaunated sandy beach sediment containing two different treatments with and without S. squamata. These cores were inserted into microcosms filled with sediment with indigenous meiofauna collected from the field. The treatments were incubated in the laboratory at ambient temperature and salinity for 2, 7, 14 and 21 days, in order to follow the colonisation process of the defaunated sediments by the indigenous nematode fauna over time. Nematodes initially colonised both treatments, with abundances of up to 10% of the densities in the control; after 2 weeks, nematode densities in the cores without S. squamata surpassed the control densities. Nematode assemblages in both treatments were not species rich, and also differed in composition from the natural assemblages. The most successful colonising species, Enoplolaimus litoralis, was rare in the surrounding sediment, suggesting that colonisation was determined by species-specific characteristics such as body size, motility and feeding strategy. Initially the presence of macrofauna did not affect the nematode community composition, but after 2 weeks of the experiment, the presence of the polychaete seemed to facilitate the earlier establishment of non-opportunistic species.","We thank Tania Nara and Giovanni dos Santos for their support during the sampling, as well as Annick Van Kenhove for her assistance in setting up the experiment and Jürgen Verstraeten for designing the cores.

Data were collected on abiotic factors, primary production, biomass and phytoplankton losses and subjected to reduction by means of several principal component analyses. Furthermore, weekly data on the same variables were gathered from published studies on Überlinger See, an embayment of the much deeper, mesotrophic Lake Constance (Central Europe), and treated in the same way. The two first principal components of PCAs on biological variables explained more than 60% of overall variance in both lakes. They could be ascribed to phytoplankton production + biomass and photosynthetic physiology + phytoplankton losses, respectively. The ordination of the biological trajectories in the data space of the two first principal components revealed six stable states of phytoplankton biomass in the shallow lake and seven in the deep lake. The breakpoints between stable states could be due to environmental, abiotic variables in some cases but biological interactions were suspected to be the cause of the other breakpoints. The abiotic effects on phytoplankton biomass took longer to occur in the deep lake. Also, short-term dynamics (one-three weeks) were demonstrated for both phytoplankton communities.A preliminary comparison between phytoplankton biomass dynamics in stratifying, shallow and deep lakes suggests that differences may be attributed partly to differences in depth.",,,Hydrobiologia,,Springer Nature,"1037-0544, 1573-5117, 0018-8158",,1994-02,1994,,1994-02,275-276,1,139-151,Closed,Article,"Alvarez Cobelas, M.; Velasco, J.

Understanding this complex conflict requires data on spatial and dietary overlap of marine mammal and fisheries. In Uruguay the South American sea lions population has been dramatically declining over the past decade. The reasons for this population decline are unknown but may include the following: (1) direct harvesting; (2) reduced prey availability and distribution as a consequence of environmental change; or (3) biological interaction with fisheries. This study aims to determine resource overlap and competition between South American sea lions (SASL, Otaria flavescens, n=10) and the artisanal fisheries (AF), and the coastal bottom trawl fisheries (CBTF). We integrated data on sea lions diet (scat analysis), spatial and annual consumption estimates; and foraging behavior-satellite-tracking data from lactating SASL with data on fishing effort areas and fisheries landings. We found that lactating SASL are benthic divers and forage in shallow water within the continental shelf. SASL's foraging areas overlapped with CBTF and AF fisheries operational areas. Dietary analysis indicated a high degree of overlap between the diet of SASL and the AF and CBTF fisheries catch. The results of our work show differing degrees of spatial resource overlap with AF and CBTF, highlighting that there are differences in potential impact from each fishery; and that different management/conservation approaches may need to be taken to solve the fisheries-SASL conflict.","We would to thank the valuable reviews and editorial comments provided by two anonymous referees.

A comprehensive research on algal dynamics, physical–biological interactions, and impacts on nutrient drawdown was conducted in summer 2010. The study found a phytoplankton bloom with chlorophyll a (Chla) > 10 mg m−3 at ice edge in July. There were 36 shared algal species in both sea ice and open water, and those species dominated numerically both environments highlighting the seeding role of ice algae for the phytoplankton bloom. The succession pattern of diatom genera at three phases from sea-ice to open-water bloom and post-bloom conditions was revealed, and the phytoplankton abundance was positively correlated with the concentration of > 20 µm fractionated Chla. An anticyclonic eddy was detected in July and significantly reduced nutrient inventories in the impacted area relative to historical values. Phytoplankton composition was an important factor for both variable drawdown ratios of silicate to dissolved inorganic nitrogen (1.31–3.37) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen to dissolved inorganic phosphorus (7.62–12.32); however, both ratios also changed between July and August. The results indicated highly dynamic biogeochemical processes during the summer. In addition, the lower bound of silicate drawdown was comparable to the amount imported through the Bering Strait, indicating the Chukchi Sea is a significant silicate sink.","This study was supported by the Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration and the crews of the R/V Xue Long for the 4th CHINARE.

Underwater sound has been proposed as one of the most important sensory cues used by these animals during this phase because it can provide direction and habitat quality information. Here, we evaluated the effect of different acoustic signals (biological and anthropogenic) on the orientation response of different stages (megalopae and juveniles) of 4 brachyuran crabs ( Cyrtograpsus angulatus , C . altimanus , Neohelice granulata , Leptuca uruguayensis ) from Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon in Argentina. A binary choice chamber system was used, and different sound sources (crustacean, fish and motorboat signals) selected from recordings of the lagoon soundscape were reproduced. C. angulatus megalopae and juveniles responded positively towards crustacean signals, while juveniles responded negatively towards fish sounds. N . granulata juveniles orientated negatively towards crustacean, motorboat and fish signals. C . altimanus and L . uruguayensis juveniles did not respond to fish signals. The results support the idea that invertebrates can discriminate among conspecific signals and highlight the role of sound on prey-predator relationships. The behavioral orientation response to the motorboat sound evidences a presumably negative effect of anthropogenic sound on the biological interactions of species. This information is important, given the urgent need to increase knowledge about coastal marine lagoons to enhance their protection, especially considering the role of the key species of crabs in this habitat.",,,Marine Ecology Progress Series,,Inter-Research Science Center,"0171-8630, 1616-1599",,2021-07-08,2021,,2021-07-08,669,,107-120,Closed,Article,"Sal Moyano, MP; Ceraulo, M; Hidalgo, FJ; Luppi, T; Nuñez, J; Radford, CA; Mazzola, S; Gavio, MA; Buscaino, G","Sal Moyano, MP (Instituto de Investigaciones Marinas y Costeras (IIMyC), FCEyN, Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata-CONICET, CC1260, 7600 Mar del Plata, Provincia de Buenos Aires, Argentina); Ceraulo, M (Institute of Anthropic Impact and Sustainability in Marine Environment-National Research Council (IAS-CNR), 91020 Torretta Granitola (TP), Italy); Hidalgo, FJ (Instituto de Investigaciones Marinas y Costeras (IIMyC), FCEyN, Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata-CONICET, CC1260, 7600 Mar del Plata, Provincia de Buenos Aires, Argentina); Luppi, T (Instituto de Investigaciones Marinas y Costeras (IIMyC), FCEyN, Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata-CONICET, CC1260, 7600 Mar del Plata, Provincia de Buenos Aires, Argentina); Nuñez, J (Instituto de Investigaciones Marinas y Costeras (IIMyC), FCEyN, Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata-CONICET, CC1260, 7600 Mar del Plata, Provincia de Buenos Aires, Argentina); Radford, CA (Institute of Marine Science, Leigh Marine Laboratory, University of Auckland, 0910 Auckland, New Zealand); Mazzola, S (Institute of Anthropic Impact and Sustainability in Marine Environment-National Research Council (IAS-CNR), 91020 Torretta Granitola (TP), Italy); Gavio, MA (Instituto de Investigaciones Marinas y Costeras (IIMyC), FCEyN, Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata-CONICET, CC1260, 7600 Mar del Plata, Provincia de Buenos Aires, Argentina); Buscaino, G (Institute of Anthropic Impact and Sustainability in Marine Environment-National Research Council (IAS-CNR), 91020 Torretta Granitola (TP), Italy)",,"Sal Moyano, MP (Institute of Marine and Coastal Research); Ceraulo, M (); Hidalgo, FJ (Institute of Marine and Coastal Research); Luppi, T (Institute of Marine and Coastal Research); Nuñez, J (Institute of Marine and Coastal Research); Radford, CA (University of Auckland); Mazzola, S (); Gavio, MA (Institute of Marine and Coastal Research); Buscaino, G ()",University of Auckland; Institute of Marine and Coastal Research,grid.9654.e; grid.501734.4,Auckland; Mar del Plata,; ,New Zealand; Argentina,,,,,,6,6,,3.36,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137952425,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3109 Zoology; 41 Environmental Sciences,,,,,,A05 Biological Sciences,14 Life Below Water
583,pub.1110071981,10.1093/mollus/eyy060,,,,Egg-capsule deposition of the marine gastropod Olivella minuta: the importance of an interspecific relationship with the soft-bottom bivalve Tivela mactroides,"In marine soft-bottom environments, the availability of hard substrates may strongly influence the reproduction of benthic species. Most marine gastropods attach egg capsules to any hard object lying on the sediment surface, but some species may choose to deposit egg capsules on living organisms. This study reports deposition of egg capsules on shells of living Tivela mactroides. We collected T. mactroides individuals in six sampling sites along a morphodynamic continuum to investigate which species was using T. mactroides as oviposition substrate as well as looking at the pattern of capsule deposition on the shells. More than 90% of T. mactroides individuals had one to 55 egg capsules on their shells, all belonging to Olivella minuta—the first record of this interspecific relationship. Most egg capsules were concentrated closer to the umbo of the bivalve (dorsal region) and there was no evident relationship between the number of egg capsules and length of T. mactroides. The number of egg capsules strongly decreased in more reflective beach conditions; however, the pattern of egg deposition on the shells was roughly similar in all sites. These findings increase our understanding of the reproductive biology of O. minuta and demonstrate the ecological importance of T. mactroides; they also emphasize that biological interactions and density-dependent relationships may influence the community ecology of soft-bottom habitats.","We are grateful to Fundação de Apoio à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP) for scholarship grants to M.R.D.

583,pub.1027443174,10.1016/j.actao.2016.06.001,,,,Competition can lead to unexpected patterns in tropical ant communities,"Ecological communities are structured by competitive, predatory, mutualistic and parasitic interactions combined with chance events. Separating deterministic from stochastic processes is possible, but finding statistical evidence for specific biological interactions is challenging. We attempt to solve this problem for ant communities nesting in epiphytic bird’s nest ferns (Asplenium nidus) in Borneo’s lowland rainforest. By recording the frequencies with which each and every single ant species occurred together, we were able to test statistically for patterns associated with interspecific competition. We found evidence for competition, but the resulting co-occurrence pattern was the opposite of what we expected. Rather than detecting species segregation—the classical hallmark of competition—we found species aggregation. Moreover, our approach of testing individual pairwise interactions mostly revealed spatially positive rather than negative associations. Significant negative interactions were only detected among large ants, and among species of the subfamily Ponerinae. Remarkably, the results from this study, and from a corroborating analysis of ant communities known to be structured by competition, suggest that competition within the ants leads to species aggregation rather than segregation. We believe this unexpected result is linked with the displacement of species following asymmetric competition. We conclude that analysing co-occurrence frequencies across complete species assemblages, separately for each species, and for each unique pairwise combination of species, represents a subtle yet powerful way of detecting structure and compartmentalisation in ecological communities.","We acknowledge support from the University of Cambridge, NERC (Grant number: RG50420), The Royal Society South East Asia Rainforest Research Programme, Yayasan Sabah, Danum Valley Management Committee, and the Economic Planning Unit in Kuala Lumpur.

583,pub.1020299345,10.1093/plankt/fbl042,,,,A physical–biological interaction underlying variable phenological responses to climate change by coastal zooplankton,"Species-specific differential responses to climate warming that alter phenologies can dramatically affect community function. Using time series data from a Northwest Atlantic estuary, we show that the phenology of a top zooplankton predator, the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi, has shifted more in response to climate warming over the past ∼50 years than that of its major prey species, the copepod Acartia tonsa. Before climatic warming, A. tonsa was the dominant secondary producer in the estuary and its main period of production occurred before the seasonal appearance of M. leidyi. However, since 2000, the seasonal peak abundances of the two species have overlapped, intensifying the predator–prey relationship and resulting in the near extirpation of the once-abundant copepod from the estuary. We propose that the physical mechanism driving the different phenological responses of the two species is differential spring warming of the winter refugia of these two species. Substantial amplification of warming patterns in shallow embayments affects overwintering M. leidyi but has little influence over seasonal excystment of overwintering A. tonsa eggs located in the broader, deeper regions of the Bay. In this way, large-scale climatic changes are expressed as local-scale temperature variations that differentially affect alternate planktonic life histories to produce novel spring population growth dynamics of the two species and, ultimately, a new summer planktonic community dynamic in Narragansett Bay.","Financial support for this research was provided by the National Science Foundation (OCE 9103309 to J.H.C., OCE 0115177 to B.K.S. and D.J.G. and RI Sea Grant NA16RG1057 to B.K.S.).

583,pub.1005545633,10.1007/s00027-014-0352-9,,,,Indirect effects of asymmetrical competition among top predators determine spatial patterns of predation risk for prey,"Asymmetrical interspecific competition among top predators can indirectly affect the predation risk for their prey by altering the abundance, diet, and habitat use of inferior competitors. However, the indirect effects of such biological interactions are poorly known because of the difficulties in measuring predation risk in nature. We addressed this issue by assessing the effect of asymmetrical competition among brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and two superior non-piscivorous competitors, creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) and white sucker (Catostomus commersonii), on the predation risk of a brook trout prey, northern redbelly dace (Chrosomus eos). We determined the spatio-temporal patterns of relative predation risk of dace with tethering experiments in 11 lakes containing either only brook trout and dace (n = 5), or brook trout, dace, chub, and sucker (n = 6). The diel pattern of the relative predation risk and the overall relative predation risk of dace were not significantly different in lakes with or without brook trout competitors. However, we observed a significant shift in the relative predation risk from the lower pelagic to the upper pelagic and littoral zones in the presence of brook trout competitors. This study highlights the fact that the outcome of interactions can vary in space and that care should be used when extrapolating the results of small-scale experiments or coarse-scale estimates to the whole ecosystem.","We thank Julie Adams, Maryse Blanchette, Come Garceau, Annie Jacob, Kathy-Andrée Laplante-Albert, Maxime Léveillé, Rachel Massicotte, Aurore Perot, Daniel Pouliot, Raphaël Proulx, Evelyne Roy, and Sylvain Theleme for their assistance at various stages of this research as well as Daniel Boisclair, Laure Devine, and Jim Grant for their comments on earlier versions of this paper.

Hence, it is crucial to conserve this marine biota for future sustainable use and to conserve our marine biodiversity. Conducting studies on the biological interactions of mud crabs in mangrove habitats can be one of the future conservation approaches. Accordingly, an analysis of the functional relationships between Scylla spp. abundance and the respective mangrove habitat have to be carried out. The research was conducted in the mangrove ecosystem of Bee Jay Bakau Resort Probolinggo (BJBR). Data were collected using line transects and quadrant transects. The Associations between mangroves and mud crab habitat structures were analyzed using the Correspondence Analysis (CA) method. The results show that the relationship matrix between Scylla spp. and the structure of the mangrove habitat is centered on the F1 and F2 factorial axes (89.22%). S. serrata of all size classes were associated with dense mangroves (≥15 trees per 100m2) and high salinities (3-4 ppt), while S. olivacea has shown to be associated with rare to very dense mangrove systems. It indicates that S. olivacea tends to have a higher adaptation rate than S. serrata in this mangrove system.

Bacterial communities are key players in most biogeochemical cycles. Here we investigated soil bacterial communities in four adjacent maize farming systems, conventional, transition, natural, and organic in order to study the effects of these practices on soil bacterial community, uncover most influential bacterial taxa and explore them as predictors of categorical and continuous soil variables (i.e. attributes). While richness and diversity were only marginally affected, we found pronounced farming system effects on bacterial community composition. The organic farming system exhibited higher bacterial community stability over two crop years. Conventional farming network exhibited the highest density and number of keystone taxa, however all keystone taxa were shared by one module only. Whilst organic farming presented the biggest and less dense network with the smallest number of keystone taxa. Blastocatellales was one of the most influential orders in organic and natural farming system networks. Bacterial taxa associated to the farming systems were visualized by a bipartite graph and used to build random forest models capable of predicting the farming system regardless of the crop year with high accuracy. The models were also able to predict soil chemical and biological attributes to a different extent. Altogether, we have shown that soil bacterial communities are deeply shaped by the underlying farming system, and can be used as a tool in sustainable farming monitoring.","We thank Dr. Ademir Durrer, Dr. Sérgio Kenji Homma and Mr. Rodrigo Henriques Longaresi for their aid during the samples acquisition.

The Río de la Plata (RdlP) is a major estuary that affects biogeographic patterns of marine coastal organisms in the south-west Atlantic, but studies of the plankton in the RdlP are scarce. Knowledge of the mysid fauna in particular is very limited with a single species (likely alien,
                    Neomysis americana

                    Mysidopsis tortonesei
                    , only recently reported. The purpose of this paper is to contribute with the knowledge of the mysid fauna of this ecosystem by exploring the spatial distribution and

The standing crop of seagrass showed two peaks in spring and fall. Population dynamics of J. slatteryi was closely correlated with the standing crop of seagrass, suggesting that there is biological interaction between these two species. The life-history pattern was annual and iteroparous with two principal periods of juvenile recruitment during the year; in spring (March to May) and fall (October to December). Overall sex ratio was female-biased. The mean body length of adults and brood size was larger in the spring breeding period than in the fall. There was a positive relationship between the brood size and body length of ovigerous females. The mean egg volume was more than 0.03 mm3 in fall breeding periods, but in other periods it was less than 0.03 mm3. Egg volume was positively related to body length of ovigerous females. At any given female size, egg volume was significantly higher in the fall than in the spring, whereas brood size in the spring was significantly larger than that in the fall. The reproductive output of females was much greater in the fall than that in the spring, suggesting higher reproductive effort during the fall breeding period.","We thank H. G. Jeong, S. G.

In this study the effects of nesting, predation, and parasitism on seed germination were evaluated, and the rates of these events were compared between the two populations. Germination tests were conducted in laboratory, using four replicates of 50 seeds. Nesting, predation and parasitism rates for each population were estimated by sampling seeds from 20 fruits per individual, and from 15 individuals per population. The seeds of P. platycephala exhibit dormancy enforced by the seed coat. The nesting breaks the dormancy, and the pre-dispersal predation of seeds by the coleoptera larvae make them inviables. The larvae predation is biologically controlled by the hymenoptera parasitism. The seed predation rates for each population were 28% and 12%, respectively, being significantly higher in the white population, which produces more and smaller seeds per fruit than the other population. The highest predation occurs because of the highest nesting rate by the coleopterans, which is positively correlated with the number of seeds per fruit. The parasitism rate was 8%, approximately, and was not significantly different between the populations. The results indicate that the differences between the densities of these populations were not related to the biological interactions, as seed predation and parasitism.",,,Brazilian Journal of Botany,,FapUNIFESP (SciELO),"0100-8404, 1806-9959",,2008-06,2008,2008-06,,31,2,245-251,All OA; Gold,Article,"de Figueiredo, Paulo Sérgio; Girnos, Emilia Cristina; Santos, Luciene Soares","de Figueiredo, Paulo Sérgio (São Luís, Universidade Federal do Maranhão, Departamento de Biologia, Brazil); Girnos, Emilia Cristina (São Luís, Universidade Federal do Maranhão, Departamento de Biologia, Brazil); Santos, Luciene Soares (São Luís, Universidade Federal do Maranhão, Departamento de Biologia, Brazil)",,"de Figueiredo, Paulo Sérgio (); Girnos, Emilia Cristina (); Santos, Luciene Soares ()",,,,,,,,,,,2,0,,0.21,,http://www.scielo.br/pdf/rbb/v31n2/v31n2a07.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1022142128,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3004 Crop and Pasture Production; 31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4103 Environmental Biotechnology",,,,,,"A06 Agriculture, Veterinary and Food Science",

Our aim was to investigate the independent and interactive effects of litter quality, mechanical fragmentation, and Collembola density on the litter decomposition process. Intact and fragmented leaf litter from two tree species with contrasting leaf litter quality were incubated in laboratory microcosms with high and low Collembola densities. Mass loss, C, and N concentrations of the leaf litter were measured. The results showed that fragmented, low C:N ratio litter with high Collembola density had the fastest rates of decomposition and C, N mineralization, while the lowest decay rates were measured in high C:N ratio litter with low Collembola density, regardless of fragmentation. Mechanical fragmentation alone could not significantly enhance the litter decomposition in either litter type without the presence of Collembola. Meanwhile, high Collembola density without mechanical fragmentation did not significantly achieve faster litter decomposition. However, mechanical fragmentation had a positive effect on increasing N concentrations and supplied with litter of higher C:N ratio. Presence of Collembola enhanced mass loss and C, N mineralization in decomposing litter of either type significantly associated with fragmentation. The positive interaction between mechanical fragmentation and Collembola reported here emphasizes the importance of multiple trophic interactions for regulating decomposition processes, including that of physical and biological interactions among all functional groups.","We thank Dr. Ferry Slik for his useful comments, and Xishuangbanna Station for Tropical Rainforest Ecosystem Studies for conducting field work and Biogeochemistry lab of Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, CAS for lab work assistance.

The population structure and recruitment pattern of both species were studied using modal decomposition of length–frequency distributions. Gastropod populations were collected from Axial Volcano and Endeavour Segment in 2002 and 2003. Polymodal size–frequency distributions, particularly at Axial Volcano vent sites, suggest a discontinuous recruitment pattern for D. globulus. In contrast, there were no distinct peaks visible in the distributions of L. fucensis, suggesting a continuous recruitment pattern for this species. For both species, distributions were positively skewed towards the smaller length–classes, implying post-settlement mortality is high. However, variations in growth, due to short- and long-term variability in environmental conditions in the hydrothermal vent habitat, as well as biological interactions, may also be influencing the distribution and abundance of subsequent life-history stages. Using maximum shell lengths from populations of known ages, the growth rate of L. fucensis was estimated as 9.6 μm day−1, indicating adulthood would be reached in ∼1 year. Our results suggest that, despite occupying the same habitat, abundance and population structure are regulated by different biotic and abiotic processes in L. fucensis and D. globulus.","We thank the crews of the R/V Thomas G.

The size and shape of the burrows varied considerably with the smallest juveniles occupying simple vertical shafts in the substrate. Larger fish were found in much larger burrows (up to 4–5 m in diameter and at least 2–3 m deep) that were funnel shaped in cross-section with the upper conical portions containing numerous smaller burrows of associated crabs. The range of burrow sizes observed suggests a regular sequence of burrow construction by tilefish and the associated crabs. Both juvenile and adult tilefish swam into the burrows head first and exited tail first. This behavior, which would preclude the possibility of ambushing prey, and evidence of predation by sharks and other tilefish, suggests that the burrow is a refuge from predators.Tilefish burrows appear to serve as a focus for biological activity. Species associated with the burrows included galatheid crabs, Cancer sp., Acanthocarpus alexandri, Homarus americanus, Heliocolenus dactylopterus and Conger oceanicus. Tilefish may play an important role in structuring outer continental shelf communities.

It has been suggested for monoecious figs, that fig pollinating wasps avoid ovipositing in flowers located close to the fig wall because of strong parasitic pressure by wasps ovipositing through the fig wall. This behaviour could help explain why mainly seeds are produced in flowers located close to the fig wall, thus stabilizing the fig-pollinating wasp mutualism. In this contribution we explore, for dioecious figs, whether ovipositor length of parasitic species may really be limiting. In dioecious figs, functionally male figs produce pollinating wasps and pollen while female figs produce only seeds, facilitating selection of traits favouring pollinator reproduction in male figs. We show in Ficus erecta that fig walls are thicker in male figs than in female figs. Male figs presenting thick walls, thicker than the length of the parasites' ovipositors, went unparasitized while male figs presenting thinner walls were systematically parasitized. Hence, in F. erecta, ovipositor length of the parasites is limiting access to some figs. However, we also show that in another dioecious species, Ficus formosana, presenting thin walled male figs, no fig is protected against oviposition by its two parasites. Hence in dioecious as well as in monoecious figs, in some Ficus species, ovipositors of the parasites are limiting access to ovules, while in other Ficus species all ovules are exposed to parasitism.","We would like to thank the National Science Council of the Republic of China, Taiwan for financially supporting this study under Contract No. NSC 87-2613-B-005-085 A07 and No. NSC 99-2923-B-002-001-MY3, and grant ANR 09 BLAN-03392-CFD7.

Here, we investigated stream bacterial alpha and beta diversity within taxonomic and phylogenetic contexts around Qiandao Lake in China. We further examined abiotic and biotic factors on bacterial communities by explicitly considering biotic variables including macroinvertebrate species richness, total cover of periphyton and submerged macrophytes. For alpha and beta diversity, there were consistently high correlations between taxonomic and observed phylogenetic metrics. Taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity could be explained by abiotic and biotic variables, though the former showed a stronger influence. Using a null model to break down the association between species phylogeny and co-occurrence, we found non-significant correlations for alpha and beta diversity between taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity, that is, the standardized effect size of phylogenetic diversity (ses.PD) or Unifrac dissimilarity (ses.Unifrac). Variations in taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity at both alpha and beta levels were mainly explained by pure effect of abiotic variables. Biotic variables, such as macroinvertebrate species richness and total cover of periphyton, significantly explained the variations in ses.PD and ses.Unifrac by 19.4% and 18.9%, respectively. Our findings provide an evidence that biotic variables play a non-negligible role in structuring bacterial communities and help to better understand the potential role of biological interactions across trophic levels in streams.","We are grateful to Esta Tonkin for assistance with field sampling.

While classical theory holds that immature neurons migrate to their destinations along radial glia, there is some preliminary evidence showing that vasculature is probably involved in that process as well. In this study, we compared vascular development with that of radial glia and the migration of neurons, so that the relationships among them could be elucidated. We found that the radial glial cells and vasculature were highly similar in their distribution and development. For instance, in the external granular layer (EGL, the putative molecular layer), the processes of radial glial cells were arranged in an orderly radial pattern, whereas in the deep areas of the cerebellum, their arrangements were in relative disorder. On the other hand, the vasculatures in EGL were usually orientated radially, which paralleled the projections of radial glia; however, the distribution of vasculature in the internal granular layer (IGL, the putative granular layer) and white matter was in relative disorder as well, similar to the pattern exhibited by radial glial processes. This high harmonization between vasculature and radial glia suggests their interconnected biological relationships during cerebellar development and neural migration. We also observed that a large number of newborn neurons were migrating along blood vessels, suggesting that the vasculature could serve as a scaffold for cell migration. In conclusion, cerebellar vasculature could guide neural migration not only as a platform for biological interaction with radial glia, but also serve scaffolding functions for neural migration.","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 30771140, 31070952, U1204311).",,Ethology Ecology & Evolution,,Taylor & Francis,"0394-9370, 0373-4137, 1125-0003, 1748-5851",,2014-11-03,2014,2014-11-03,2015-01-02,82,1,15-24,Closed,Article,"Xi, Y.; Chen, W.

In this study, a modeling framework was developed to assess the response of environmental variables to climate change scenarios in Lake Taihu, China. A coupled hydrodynamic-water quality-sediment flux model was employed to simulate water quality processes under future climate scenarios projected from a general circulation model (GCM) forced by the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5). The results showed that the climate change impacted physico-chemical parameters and biological interactions in Lake Taihu. The annual average water temperature increased by 0.96, 2.09, and 3.2 °C by the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s, respectively. Daily temperature stratification tended to occur earlier and the period of stratification increased, especially in summer during calm wind conditions. The sediment flux increased and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration decreased with climate change. Additionally, climate change increased the onset time, duration, and areas of algal blooms. The results showed that the blooms activation time advanced approximately six days per decade. The onset time of algal blooms of 2080s was in February and March and the elevated concentration of chlorophyll a lasted until late autumn in the west lake region. The chlorophyll a concentration in summer did not increase substantially (about 10–15 μg/L). Overall, water management strategies and ecological restoration plans in Lake Taihu, mainly based on nutrient load reduction and hydrodynamic modification, should incorporate anticipated effects of climate change.","We would like to thank the Taihu Laboratory for Lake Ecosystem Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, for providing monitoring data.","The research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 51379061] and Jiangsu Province Science Foundation [grant number BK20131370], [grant number 2010CB951101].

However, rates of sedimentation and the effects of trapped sediments may be influenced by water flow. The first goal of this study was to quantify gradients in sedimentation and flow along fringing and back reefs of the north shore of Moorea, French Polynesia, and determine whether such gradients correlate with changes in the frequency and outcomes of massive Porites–algal turf interactions. On the back reef, the frequency of Porites–algal turf interactions and the competitive success of algal turfs increased significantly with decreasing flow. Sedimentation, however, was not a significant driver of the observed patterns. Along fringing reefs, in the absence of a flow gradient, it was the gradient in sedimentation that best explained spatial variation in Porites–algal turf interaction frequencies and the competitive success of algal turfs. The second goal was to quantify the separate and combined effects of flow and sedimentation on Porites–algal turf interactions in a laboratory setting. The combined effects of low flow and sedimentation significantly increased the area of Porites tissue damaged when in contact with algal turf, while high flow attenuated the negative effects of sedimentation. Together, these results implicate flow and sedimentation as important drivers of biological interactions between massive Porites and algal turf.","Sincere thanks to Dr. Peter Edmunds, Dr. Andrew Brooks, Dr. Mark Steele, and the reviewers of this manuscript for their comments and improvements.

Very little attention has been directed at the responses of tropical plants to increases in global atmospheric CO2 concentrations and the potential climatic changes. The available data, from greenhouse and laboratory studies, indicate that the photosynthesis, growth and water use efficiency of tropical plants can increase at higher CO2 concentrations. However, under field conditions abiotic (light, water or nutrients) or biotic (competition or herbivory) factors might limit these responses. In general, elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations seem to increase plant tolerance to stress, including low water availability, high or low temperature, and photoinhibition. Thus, some species may be able to extend their ranges into physically less favourable sites, and biological interactions may become relatively more important in determining the distribution and abundance of species. Tropical plants may be more narrowly adapted to prevailing temperature regimes than are temperate plants, so expected changes in temperature might be relatively more important in the tropics. Reduced transpiration due to decreased stomatal conductance could modify the effects of water stress as a cue for vegetative or reproductive phenology of plants of seasonal tropical areas. The available information suggests that changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations could affect processes as varied as plant/herbivore interactions, decomposition and nutrient cycling, local and geographic distributions of species and community types, and ecosystem productivity. However, data on tropical plants are few, and there seem to be no published tropical studies carried out in the field. Immediate steps should be undertaken to reduce our ignorance of this critical area.",,,Plant Cell & Environment,,Wiley,"0140-7791, 1365-3040",,1991-10,1991,2006-04-28,1991-10,14,8,763-778,Closed,Article,"HOGAN, K.

Sampling was standardized using nets (25 m x 2 m) of three mesh sizes set for 24-h periods. Based on data from >10,000 hours of gill netting over three years, there were significant differences in assemblage composition among the four habitats. Pair-wise comparisons suggested differences in assemblage composition between all pairs of habitats except creeks and lagoons. Differences in assemblage composition likely arose from species-specific habitat affinities. For example, 21 taxa were collected from both creeks and lagoons, but not from sand banks or the main river channel; each of these 21 taxa were associated with particular features characteristic of creeks and lagoons (e.g. abundant detritus). Assemblage structure also could be influenced by predation or other biological interactions, but mechanistic experiments are needed to evaluate this hypothesis. Assemblage composition was highly variable within all habitat types, likely the result of spatial and temporal heterogeneity associated with seasonal hydrology. Long distance migrations by prochilodontids and other taxa contributed to higher CPUE during the rising-water period of May 2002.

However, little information is available as to how dredging affects the macrobenthic community structure. The objective of this study was to determine the impacts of large-scale exhibition dredging on the macrobenthic community of Gyeonggi Bay, Korea, where sand mining has continued for 20 years. Prior to dredging, the macrobenthic species composition was similar to that of areas near the dredging site, with several common dominant species found before dredging. After dredging, the number of species, density, and diversity (H') in the experimental area (sites 0 and 1) decreased significantly, but no difference was observed at other sites. Multivariate analysis (multidimensional scaling) revealed significant differences in community structure before and after dredging. The amphipod Urothoe grimaldii japonica, which was the most dominant species at sites 0,1, and 2, decreased rapidly at sites 0 and 1 after dredging, but no difference was observed at site 2. In addition, the index of multivariate dispersion (IMD) and the relative IMD (r. IMD) were large at sites 0 and 1, suggesting that the effects of dredging were direct at site 0 and 1, but indirect at site 2. The macrobenthic communities at sites 3 and 4 were not affected by dredging, but they were affected by physical conditions and biological interactions. We suggest that benthic biotope indices such as the IMD and r.IMD may constitute a valid tool for assessing the effects of dredging on the macrobenthic community; long-term monitoring is required to verify this.",,,Ocean and Polar Research,,Korea Ocean Research and Development Institute,"1598-141X, 2234-7313",,2006-06-30,2006,,2006-06-30,28,2,129-144,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Yu, Ok-Hwan; Lee, Hyung-Gon; Lee, Jae-Hac; Kim, Dong-Sung","Yu, Ok-Hwan (); Lee, Hyung-Gon (); Lee, Jae-Hac (); Kim, Dong-Sung ()",,"Yu, Ok-Hwan (); Lee, Hyung-Gon (); Lee, Jae-Hac (); Kim, Dong-Sung ()",,,,,,,,,,,16,2,,1.22,,http://koreascience.or.kr:80/article/JAKO200612242769520.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1022498194,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 41 Environmental Sciences,,,,,,A05 Biological Sciences,

The community is dominated by rotifers in spring and by small cladocerans in summer and fall. It seems that the zooplankton community structure has not been changed markedly since the 1960s. Two Bosmina species, B. longirostris and B. fatalis, show seasonal and reciprocal succession: the dominance of B. longirostris occurs in spring and fall and that of B. fatalis in summer. The summer dominance of B. fatalis has positive correlations with the mean summer water temperature and the mean summer chlorphyll a concentration, suggesting that it is induced by the occurrence of the cyanobacterium Microcystis bloom. Voluminous enclosures were set up in the lake, and experiments were conduced with them to understand the mechanisms maintaining the lake ecosystem. Results of the experiments have shown some important biological interactions related to zooplankton, such as predator-prey relationships and competition. In Lake Suwa, not only the pelagic commuity but also the community in vegetation areas has been studied. These studies have demonstrated that environment is highly diverse in the vegetation area, and that the zooplankton community achieves a higher species richness in the vegetation area than in the pelagic one. It is suggested that the zooplankton community in Lake Suwa is exposed to heavy predation pressure by planktivorous fish, and that the major food chain from primary producer to zooplankton in summer is a detritus food chain.",,,Japanese Journal of Limnology (Rikusuigaku Zasshi),,The Japanese Society of Limnology,"1882-4897, 0021-5104",,2001,2001,,2001,62,2,151,All OA; Bronze,Article,"HANAZATO, Takayuki; ARAKAWA, Takashi; SAKUMA, Masataka; CHANG, Kwang-Hyeon; OKINO, Tokio","HANAZATO, Takayuki (); ARAKAWA, Takashi (); SAKUMA, Masataka (); CHANG, Kwang-Hyeon (); OKINO, Tokio ()",,"HANAZATO, Takayuki (); ARAKAWA, Takashi (); SAKUMA, Masataka (); CHANG, Kwang-Hyeon (); OKINO, Tokio ()",,,,,,,,,,,15,0,,1.12,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/rikusui1931/62/2/62_2_151/_pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1001324521,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 41 Environmental Sciences,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,14 Life Below Water

Quantitative niche models estimate picophytoplankton cell abundance based on photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), temperature and nitrate and thus can be used to study picophytoplankton phenology. We used quantitative niche models to estimate the abundance of picophytoplankton groups for the global ocean in 1-degree grids and the upper 200 m of the water column. The inputs of the models were the monthly climatology of temperature and nitrate from the World Ocean Atlas (WOA) and PAR from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS-Aqua). We aimed to study phenological cycles of picophytoplankton and establish a mean baseline to contrast changes in the distribution of Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus and picoeukaryotic phytoplankton. Prochlorococcus presented high abundances in ≥ 9 months in an uninterrupted area between 20ºN-S, whereas Synechococcus and picoeukaryotic phytoplankton showed high abundances in three areas: between 20ºN-S, and around 45ºN and 45ºS. Abundance seasonal change was 7, 15 and 28% around the annual mean, respectively, and the three groups presented two peaks. The seasonality of picophytoplankton was among the lowest compared to other phytoplankton groups and processes in the global ocean. The combined effects of groups’ ecological sensitivity captured by the niche models and basins environmental variability provided by the WOA shaped the uneven phenological cycle of picophytoplankton groups.","Financial support for this study was provided by Universidad de Buenos Aires UBACyT 20020170100620BA, Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica PICT-2017-3020, ECOS-Sud (A18ST08) and Programa de Investigación, Desarrollo e Innovación en Ciencias del Mar A6 BioMMAr.

567,pub.1146338500,10.1002/ecs2.3971,,,,"Functional dispersion of wetland birds, invertebrates, and plants more strongly influenced by hydroperiod than each other","The relative role of biological and abiotic filters in the assembly of co‐occurring taxa is of broad interest to ecologists. While some authors point to biological interactions (e.g., competition) as the stronger driver of ecological selection, others assert that abiotic conditions are more important because they filter species at the regional level. Because communities influenced by a dominant abiotic filter (e.g., Prairie Pothole Region [PPR] wetlands, each varying in their ponded water permanence) often have strong cross‐taxon relationships, we can study these communities to better understand the relative influence of abiotic versus biotic filters on community structure. Using functional dispersion as our measure of communities, we test six alternate hypotheses about the relative importance of various pathways representing influence of biological and permanence filters on birds, aquatic macroinvertebrates, and wetland plants in the northwest PPR using structural equation modeling. We aimed to understand whether (1) ponded water permanence alone explained functional dispersion; (2) the influence of permanence on functional dispersion was direct or mediated; and (3) abiotic filtering by permanence was stronger than biotic filtering by co‐occurring taxa. The best model suggests that there is a direct influence of permanence on the functional dispersion of each taxonomic group and that both bird and macroinvertebrate functional dispersion are causally related to plant functional dispersion, though for invertebrates, the influence of plants is much less than that of permanence. Thus, the relative importance of wetland permanence and the functional dispersion of co‐occurring taxa depend on which taxon is considered in PPR wetlands.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We are grateful to Alberta Innovates grant #2094A and the Ontario Trillium Scholarship for funding this research.

This process occurs in passive and active ways and can be variable throughout the day, mainly between the nocturnal and diurnal periods. Here, we evaluate the periodicity of the drift of aquatic insects in two streams of the Middle Iguaçu basin, southern region of Brazil. We predicted that the drift of aquatic insects brings the highest richness, diversity and abundance during the nocturnal period, compared to the diurnal period. In addition, we expected that the composition of species is different between these periods. In each stream, aquatic insect sampling was carried out 10 times, for 24 hours, using drift nets. A total of 2,114 aquatic insect specimens were recorded, distributed in 26 families. Of these families, 20 were recorded during the diurnal period and 24 during the nocturnal period. Our results showed an increase in the diversity and abundance of aquatic insect drift in the nocturnal period. However, only abundance was significantly different between the periods. We attribute the higher abundance in nocturnal drift possibly to biological interactions. Thus, nocturnal drift can be a strategy of some aquatic insects to avoid visual predation by other invertebrates and/or vertebrates, in Neotropical streams. We highlight the importance of our study, because it can be used for comparison in surveys of lotic environments that have been impacted by human activity (e.g. by dam construction), which can alter the water flow, and consequently the pattern of insect drift.",,,Acta Scientiarum Biological Sciences,,Universidade Estadual de Maringa,"1679-9283, 1807-863X",,2021-09-14,2021,2021-09-14,,43,,e54931,All OA; Gold,Article,"Campos, Ramiro de; Rosa, Jonathan; Higuti, Janet; Buggenhagen, Tayane Cristina; Krawczyk, Ana Carolina de Deus Bueno","Campos, Ramiro de (); Rosa, Jonathan (); Higuti, Janet (); Buggenhagen, Tayane Cristina (); Krawczyk, Ana Carolina de Deus Bueno ()",,"Campos, Ramiro de (); Rosa, Jonathan (); Higuti, Janet (); Buggenhagen, Tayane Cristina (); Krawczyk, Ana Carolina de Deus Bueno ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,https://periodicos.uem.br/ojs/index.php/ActaSciBiolSci/article/download/54931/751375152716,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143170889,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,A05 Biological Sciences,14 Life Below Water

Increasing visitation, however, can compromise ecological integrity. A fundamental conundrum is that if parks are to serve as our most pristine places, then we must understand how human presence alters biological interactions. Species that redistribute themselves closer to people is of growing management concern both in and out of national parks because of 1) human safety, 2) animal health, and 3) ecological consequences. Drivers of distributional change are often dissimilar but may include increased association with people for predator avoidance – the human shield hypothesis. We examine redistribution patterns with comparative, observational, and experimental approaches contrasting ecological responses of an iconic species in an USA national park - Glacier. Specifically, we focused on the role of predator-avoidance and resource enhancement to test whether a cold-adapted alpine obligate, mountain goats, (Oreamnos americanus), mediate their distribution by increasing spatial overlap with humans. Individuals that enhanced mineral acquisition through access to human urine concomitantly reduced behavioral and ecological responses to grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) experiments. Goats near people also displayed reduced group sizes, vigilance, use of escape terrain, and forfeited migrations to naturally occurring minerals. Our findings re-enforce the increasing complexities of natural area management because visitation is altering ecological interactions. While protected areas offer some forms of baselines for scientists and enjoyment for millions of visitors, redistribution of species and associated ecological changes signifies that additional care will be needed in what we perceive as pristine and what is anthropogenically-altered.","This project was funded by the National Park Service, Federal Highway Administration, the Jerry O&#x27;Neil Fellowship, Wyss Scholarship, and a Sigma-Xi Grants-in-Aid Award.

Here, we identified species associations with T. coccinea by comparing community structure between invaded and non-invaded areas at Búzios Island, SP, Brazil. We also investigated effects of chemical cues from representative benthic species on sun-coral larval performance in the laboratory and quantified the density of sun-coral recruits across different microhabitats in the field. Field surveys showed that the invasion of the sun-coral is more intense at reef areas of higher species richness and diversity, putting at risk a higher number of native species than anticipated and suggesting that local richness offers little resistance to invasion. Highest density of T. coccinea recruits observed on the least bioactive encrusting corallines suggests this taxonomic group may constitute doorways to the establishment of this coral. In contrast, field patterns of sun-coral colonies and recruits, as well as laboratory trials, suggest that cnidarian-dominated habitats represent obstacles to the sun-coral invasion. Thus, while areas dominated by the snowflake coral Carijoa riisei—which showed the greatest negative allelopathic effect on T. coccinea—likely provide resistance to the invader spreading, areas covered by encrusting coralline algae and ‘barren substrates’ probably facilitate its establishment. Because these latter, less-structured microhabitats often prevail after disturbance, damage assessment following human-mediated impacts should include detection and control of sun-coral populations.","We are grateful to the technical staff of the CEBIMar/USP, especially Alex Monteiro, Joseilto Medeiros de Oliveira and Elso Alves da Silva for their support in field surveys and laboratory experiments.

The distribution pattern of corals and benthic space partitioning patterns on the fringing reefs of southern Taiwan were studied by the line‐transect method. The bathymetric distribution of corals in the study area was basically homogeneous except on the protected reef slopes and the exposed reef fronts and terraces. Corals on protected reef slopes are mainly foliaceous, including Montipora foliosa, Merulina ampliata, Mycedium elephantotus, and Pachyseris speciosa, but the dominant species on a reef slope vary from site to site. The formation of the foliaceous coral community is possibly related to a complex of environmental factors, chance, and biological interactions. The reef fronts and submarine terraces of exposed areas are dominated by alcyonacean corals. The most abundant species are Sarcophyton trocheliophorum, S. crassocaule, and Lobophytum sarcophytoides; their distributions are relatively homogeneous. The formation of alcyonacean‐dominated assemblages can be related to the special adaptive strategies of these corals. In regard to space partitioning patterns, the major space occupiers on those reefs exposed to storm disturbances are alcyonacean soft corals, scleractinian corals, and algae; on reefs protected from storms, scleractinian corals and algae dominate. Two conspicuous features of the study area are the high proportion of space occupied by algae and the abundant unoccupied space. The dense algal cover is possibly caused by sewage pollution and overfishing of the reef area. The unoccupied space is most likely related to the high frequency of typhoon disturbances.",,,Marine Ecology,,Wiley,"0173-9565, 1439-0485",,1993-09,1993,2008-05-13,1993-09,14,3,185-204,Closed,Article,"Dai, Chang‐Feng","Dai, Chang‐Feng (Institute of Oceanography, National Taiwan University, P.O.

We consequently assessed patterns of subtidal mollusc assemblages on subtropical rocky reefs in the Solitary Islands Marine Park (SIMP), eastern Australia. Shelled molluscs (specifically shelled gastropods and bivalves) were targeted to test if: (1) mollusc assemblages change with increasing distance from shore; (2) reef orientation (vertical and horizontal reef faces) influences assemblage structure; (3) sessile benthic communities influence the composition of mollusc assemblages. Multivariate analyses of community patterns indicated strong cross-shelf patterns. However, no significant differences were found for summary community variables (species richness, total abundance). Inshore sites were dominated by large herbivores (especially turbinids) and prey-specific ranellids. Mid-shelf assemblages comprised a mix of taxa that occurred in both inshore and offshore assemblages and were thus transitional between these shelf positions. Offshore assemblages were distinctly different to reefs closer to shore and were characterised primarily by the presence of sedentary (Vermetidae and Chamidae), and tropically-affiliated taxa. Relationships with reef orientations were found to be inconsistent and correlations with sessile benthos were relatively weak. The overall patterns are similar to those found for corals and fish in the region and most likely reflect the increasing influence of the East Australian Current offshore.","This study was conducted with support from the School of Environmental and Rural Science and the National Marine Science Centre, University of New England.

Studies focused on the response of low diversity communities in soils of the Antarctic Dry Valleys and the Chihuahuan Desert of the southwestern USA, to manipulations of soil resources and climate, offer the best opportunity to learn about the environmental controls on soil biodiversity and the role of biodiversity in soil functioning. We propose that insights based on research in these extreme environments should be applicable to understanding soil biodiversity in more complex, temperate and tropical ecosystems. The study of extreme soil ecosystems may also provide information on the response of soil biodiversity to increasing occurrences of environmental extremes that are predicted to occur from global change models. Studies from hot and cold deserts show that decomposition-based food webs can be very simple, that aridity produces similar mechanisms for survival and dispersal of organisms in temperate and polar systems, that suitable soil habitats are patchily distributed in arid environments, and the low biodiversity of extreme soil ecosystems creates little or no functional redundancy making these systems susceptible to disturbance. We suggest that species within the same functional group can have small differences in ecology that are sufficient to affect ecosystem processes. When this occurs, differential responses of species to disturbance within a functional group will not stabilise the soil ecosystem, but rather lead to dramatic changes in community composition and ecosystem process rates.","The authors wish to thank Dr. Gina Adams for her critical and helpful review, anonymous reviewers, and Mr. Dan Bumbarger, Mr. Mark St. John and Dr. Andy Parsons for their help with this manuscript.

This prevalence of physical control may be regarded as a typical property of exposed coastal areas. In an offshore direction, the importance of wave effects on the benthos will diminish until a depth is reached where they are no longer significant [wave exclusion hypothesis (WEH)]. This loss of a coastal property may be used to define an offshore depth limit of the coastal zone. We used a large set of benthos data from the SE North Sea to test whether an offshore limit of the coast can be clearly recognised despite strong small-scale variability and how this limit would vary seasonally and from year to year. In accordance with WEH, both species density and total abundance of macrobenthos were low in the surf zone, strongly increased with depth, and averaged over all sampling dates became relatively constant below 30 m depth. Seasonally, these gradients were weaker during summer recruitment than during autumn. Species richness, by contrast, showed no significant difference with depth. In single years, the depth of the turning point from increasing abundances to constant abundances varied between 20 and 31 m (equivalent to 40–80 km off the coastline) depending on wave height. We conclude that this zone can be derived from benthic community gradients.",,,Helgoland Marine Research,,Springer Nature,"1438-387X, 1438-3888",,2013-07-16,2013,2013-07-16,2014-03,68,1,1-16,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Armonies, Werner; Buschbaum, Christian; Hellwig-Armonies, Monika","Armonies, Werner (Alfred-Wegener-Institut Helmholtz-Zentrum für Polar- und Meeresforschung, Wattenmeerstation Sylt, Hafenstr. 43, 25992, List, Germany); Buschbaum, Christian (Alfred-Wegener-Institut Helmholtz-Zentrum für Polar- und Meeresforschung, Wattenmeerstation Sylt, Hafenstr. 43, 25992, List, Germany); Hellwig-Armonies, Monika (Alfred-Wegener-Institut Helmholtz-Zentrum für Polar- und Meeresforschung, Wattenmeerstation Sylt, Hafenstr. 43, 25992, List, Germany)","Armonies, Werner (Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research)","Armonies, Werner (Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research); Buschbaum, Christian (Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research); Hellwig-Armonies, Monika (Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research)",Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research,grid.10894.34,Bremerhaven,,Germany,,,,,,20,6,,2.28,,https://hmr.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1007/s10152-013-0364-1,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1033028440,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,14 Life Below Water

Proportionate abundances of benthic components occurring in rock scrape (131 spp.) and pumped (167 spp.) samples (190 spp. total) were compared using coefficient of community (CC) and percent similarity of community (PSc). Pumped samples were judged better estimators of benthic community structure and composition than were rock scrape samples because they more thoroughly and instantaneously sampled the benthos. Rock scrape samples in particular were subject to loss of Amphipoda. Comparisons among sites using CC, PSc, and cluster analysis indicated two major clusters of sites, one dominated by Chironomidae and the other dominated for the most part by the amphipod Hyalella azteca. No water chemistry differences of biological importance were noted during the fall and no biological interactions, such as fish predation, could explain observed benthic community differences. The factor which best accounted for differences in the benthic community among sites was physical characteristics such as water temperature, shelter from excessive wave activity, and rock configuration. However, despite differences, the most remarkable feature among rock sites was their similarity since dominant taxa of Amphipoda, Chironomidae, Acarina, and to some extent Naididae, were quite predictable, although rank order of dominance changed from site to site. Similarity among sites was attributed to similar trophic conditions, while dissimilarity was attributed to physical characteristics acting within and upon each site.",,,Journal of Great Lakes Research,,Elsevier,0380-1330,,1987-01,1987,,1987-01,13,1,3-17,Closed,Article,"Winnell, Michael H.; Jude, David J.","Winnell, Michael H.

The ability to control the densities of focal organisms makes these structures a powerful tool. However, cages can often produce artifacts that influence the outcome of experiments. Although a subset of these artifacts have been examined previously, the effects of cages on water motion have not been adequately addressed from a quantitative standpoint, especially in high-flow environments. We targeted this data gap by explicitly measuring the fractional degree of velocity reduction inside a variety of experimental cage structures across flow conditions spanning those typical of wave-swept shallow subtidal and intertidal zones. Cages decreased velocities inside by up to 47% and reduced high-energy impact forces by more than 40%. Associated cage controls, employed to mimic physical effects of cages without interfering with organism movement, often had effects on water flow similar to those of cages. However, the nearly half an order of magnitude change in velocities inside cages and their controls reveals the need to be vigilant in considering potential artifacts, especially those tied to secondary biological interactions. These artifacts may be reduced by maximizing mesh size, employing large plot sizes and low profile structures, using cage controls that best mimic effects of the full cage, and monitoring cage controls to avoid the establishment of high-density “consumer hotels” within them. Using such approaches, researchers can minimize experimental biases and simplify the explanation of experimental results.","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation grants OCE-0241447 and OCE-9985946, and is contribution number 2370 from the Bodega Marine Laboratory, University of California at Davis.

During formation, cold water of Slope origin and the associated flora and fauna are entrapped within a ring of Gulf Stream water. These systems generally move southwesterly into the Sargasso Sea and are of biological interest because they offer a unique opportunity to assess the relative importance of physical and biotic factors in determining the distribution and abundance of plankton organisms. In effect, the formation and consequent decay of a cold core ring represents a large-scale ecological field experiment wherein major environmental changes are gradually imposed on a plankton community.Four cruises have been made to sample Gulf Stream rings and the surrounding Sargasso Sea. Biomass has been estimated and selected species of Zooplankton, phytoplankton, and midwater fish populations have been assessed. Concurrent hydrocasts have yielded physical-chemical data.Although a ring may remain physically identifiable for as long as two years, decay of the initially distinct biological community appears to be more rapid. A Zooplankton assemblage appears to persist longer than a phytoplankton assemblage. The season of formation appears to be critical in determining the biological changes of a Gulf Stream ring.

Moreover, studies on nestedness usually rarely incorporate the functional traits of the species and the environmental characteristics of the sites. In this study, we constructed a species presence–absence matrix of a 50-ha forest plot, used the simulated annealing algorithm to reveal the maximum nested structure and further tested the significance of nestedness patterns by constructing null ensembles. The nested ranks were used to represent the orders of species and quadrats in the maximum nestedness matrix. The regression tree analysis was used to reveal the relationships of nested ranks with environmental factors and functional traits. We found that the co-occurrence pattern of local plant communities was significantly nested. The regression tree results showed that the nested ranks of quadrats were determined by soil available phosphorus, soil water content, soil organic carbon and soil pH. Intraspecific variation of functional traits, including leaf C, leaf pH, leaf dry matter content and maximum photosynthetic rate rather than means of functional traits, provided a better explanation for the formation of species’ nested ranks. Understanding the causes of species and quadrats nested ranks provides novel lens and useful insights into ecological processes underlying nestedness, and further improves our knowledge of how local plant communities are assembled.",,,Journal of Plant Ecology,,Oxford University Press (OUP),"1752-9921, 1752-993X",,2022-03-22,2022,2022-03-22,2022-12-01,15,6,1185-1198,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Wang, Weitao; Jiang, Yun; Chen, Yongfa; Luo, Wenqi; He, Dong; Wang, Youshi; Chu, Chengjin; Li, Buhang","Wang, Weitao (); Jiang, Yun (); Chen, Yongfa (); Luo, Wenqi (); He, Dong (); Wang, Youshi (); Chu, Chengjin (); Li, Buhang ()",,"Wang, Weitao (); Jiang, Yun (); Chen, Yongfa (); Luo, Wenqi (); He, Dong (); Wang, Youshi (); Chu, Chengjin (); Li, Buhang ()",,,,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China,,China,grant.8915724,31925027,1,1,,,1,https://academic.oup.com/jpe/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jpe/rtac039/42979047/rtac039.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146526678,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 41 Environmental Sciences,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,

The distribution of microbes, however, is neither uniform nor random. Instead, it is dictated by physical, chemical, and biological processes and conditions and varying over small spatial and temporal scales. The feedbacks between these processes make the soil-microbe complex a self-organizing system capable of adapting to the continuously changing conditions mainly driven by the highly fluctuating water content. For making meaningful predictions on the spatiotemporal dynamics of soil microbes and their functions, we need to integrate knowledge from physics, chemistry, and biology in our modeling approaches. Here, we review modeling studies with a focus on spatiotemporal dynamics of bacteria and bacterial functions in soil microhabitats. We compare these studies along four dimensions: specific aim, model type (individual-based, population-based), scale, and considered physical, chemical, biological processes and aspects. A special emphasis is laid on modeling approaches considering processes and aspects influencing the spatial distribution of bacteria such as motility, vector-based dispersal and biofilm formation. This includes factors like soil structure, carbon and oxygen gradients, temporal variations in hydration conditions or anthropogenic disturbance events. By assessing the importance of different microscale bacterial processes, this review should contribute to the ongoing discussion on challenges related to the upscaling from the microscopic via the profile to the landscape scale.

Yet, these are primarily investigated by assessing abundance fluctuations of a few dominant species, which inadequately reflect ecosystem‐wide changes. In addition, it is increasingly recognized that it is not species identity per se, but their traits that determine environmental responses, biological interactions and ecosystem functioning. In this study, we investigated long‐term, spatio‐temporal variability in trait composition across multiple organism groups to assess whether functional changes occur in a similar way across trophic levels and whether shifts in trait composition link to environmental change. We combined extensive trait datasets with long‐term surveys (30–40 yr) of four organism groups (phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates and fish) in three environmentally distinct areas of a large marine ecosystem. We found similar temporal trajectories in the community weighted mean trait time‐series of the different trophic groups, revealing ecosystem‐wide functional changes. The traits involved and their dynamics differed between areas, concurrent with climate‐driven changes in temperature and salinity, as well as more local dynamics in nutrients and oxygen. This finding highlights the importance of considering both global climate, as well as local external drivers when studying ecosystem changes. Using a multi‐trophic trait‐based approach, our study demonstrates the importance of integrating community functional dynamics across multiple trophic levels to capture ecosystem‐wide responses which could, ultimately, help moving towards a holistic understanding, assessment and management of marine ecosystems.",,,Ecography,,Wiley,"0906-7590, 1600-0587",,2019-11-13,2019,2019-11-13,2020-02,43,2,197-208,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Pecuchet, Laurene; Lindegren, Martin; Kortsch, Susanne; Całkiewicz, Joanna; Jurgensone, Iveta; Margonski, Piotr; Otto, Saskia A.; Putnis, Ivars; Strāķe, Solvita; Nordström, Marie C.","Pecuchet, Laurene (Environmental and Marine Biology, Åbo Akademi Univ., Turku, Finland; Norwegian College of Fishery Science, UiT The Arctic Univ. of Norway, Tromsø, Norway); Lindegren, Martin (Centre for Ocean Life, National Inst. of Aquatic Resources (DTU‐Aqua), Technical Univ. of Denmark, Kgs.

In general, a tendency to assume local processes to be deterministic and regional to be stochastic dominates, although it is challenged. Fortunately, it can be cast as a testable proposition: if correct, the degree of determinism in the final community structure might indicate which process is more prominent in the control of community structure. However, recent findings have also suggested that stochastic patterns can arise from local processes and that dispersal can homogenize communities, which would make them appear deterministic irrespective of the mechanism involved. To evaluate these competing expectations we conducted an experiment where the initial communities had the same composition and species abundances. We hypothesized that if local processes dominate, then arrays of communities will show divergence of community structures whether connected by dispersal or not (i.e., being fully isolated). Alternatively, if regional processes dominate, the dispersal connected communities should converge while isolated ones should not. We found, however, that both groups of experimental communities showed similar patterns of change - a decline in similarity and a tendency to diverge. This suggests that biological interactions, demographic stochasticity, or both, exert noticeable control over community structure such that they reduce similarity among replicate communities and diversify their final states. We speculate that these mechanisms enhance potential for species additions, particularly in conjunction with factors such as dispersal and the size of the regional species pool.",,,Community Ecology,,Springer Nature,"1585-8553, 1588-2756",,2016-06,2016,2016-12-30,2016-06,17,1,1-7,All OA; Green,Article,"Márquez, J.; Kolasa, J.; Sciullo, L.","Márquez, J.

These included seasonal population movements, degree of interspecific horizontal overlap, life stage segregation within and between species, and sand depth stratification. Behavioral interactions related to competition for available space are considered important in affecting the distribution and abundance of amphipod species, and community structure. Significant negative correlations were shown between the abundance and upper distributional limits of the smaller, lower shore Acanthohaustorius millsi and the abundance of the larger, higher shore species Haustorius canadensis. Tolerance limits to a variety of prevailing physical factors alone, were not considered a serious obstacle to occupation of higher intertidal level sands by A. millsi. Summer brooding females of both species occupied similar 5 to 10 cm sand depths, but were strongly segregated horizontally. Laboratory coexistence experiments during the reproductive period showed increased mortality of adults and negligible reproductive output of A. millsi when in combination with H. canadensis compared to controls where the former species was alone. A third species, Amphiporeia virginiana, occupied primarily very shallow sand (0 to 2.5 cm), and performed seasonal movements opposite in direction to A. millsi and H. canadensis. The presence, amount, and refinement of biological interactions across the wave exposure gradient requires further study. Until then, we consider as inappropriate the blanket designation of all types of intertidal sand communities as “physically controlled”.",,,Marine Biology,,Springer Nature,"0025-3162, 1432-1793",,1980-12,1980,,1980-12,61,1,79-88,Closed,Article,"Croker, R.

Physical stress, as measured by rock surface temperature and evaporation of distilled water, was greatest higher on the shore as a result of increased exposure time. Exclusion of herbivores (by caging) and alteration of physical factors (by shading) caused little visible change in community structure in the mid shore. There was also no difference in community structure between open rock areas and control treatments for experimental manipulations at either shore level. Chlorophyll levels increased in rock chips from treatments at both shore levels that excluded herbivores, but still allowed access to sunlight, indicating a developing biofilm. In the low shore, however, treatments that provided refuge from herbivores and direct sunlight were colonized by barnacles (Balanus amphitrite) and an encrusting alga, Hildenbrandia. There appeared to be an interaction between these factors in structuring the community, removal of herbivores allowed the settlement of barnacles which was greatest in shaded treatments. On Hong Kong shores during the summer months biological interactions are important low on the shore in combination with physical factors.

We highlight the prompt response of surface water ecosystems to both orbital- and suborbital-climatic variations. A markedly different spatial response was observed in calcareous plankton assemblages, possibly due to the influence of the North Atlantic climatic system in the western, central and northern areas and of the monsoon system in the easternmost and southern sites. Orbital-induced climatic dynamics led to productive surface waters in the northern, western and central Mediterranean Sea during the last glacial and to distinct deep chlorophyll maximum layers in the eastern Mediterranean Sea coinciding with bottom anoxia episodes. High-frequency planktonic modifications are well documented in the Sicily Channel and Alboran Sea and highlight the occurrence of different steps within a single stadial (cold phase)/interstadial (warm phase) oscillation. The review of planktonic organisms in the marine sedimentary archive casts light on the uniqueness of the Mediterranean Sea, especially in terms of climatic/oceanographic/biological interaction and influence of different climatic systems on distinct areas.

In particular, G. vermiculophylla increases habitat complexity and provides a novel hard substrate in an otherwise two dimensional habitat. Following our observations that the native omnivorous mud snail Ilyanassa obsoleta utilizes G. vermiculophylla for egg capsule deposition, our field surveys demonstrated that the in situ abundance of egg capsules on G. vermiculophylla matched abundances on a native alga Ceramium virgatum and were at least 11–50 times greater than on all other co-occurring macrophytes. Additionally, through mesocosm experiments, we showed that I. obsoleta preferentially deposits eggs on the invasive G. vermiculophylla over native substrates. However, despite the thick layer of egg capsules found on G. vermiculophylla, no detrimental effects were seen on thalli growth. In contrast, growth of the native red alga Ceramium virgatum was significantly reduced when egg capsules were present, suggesting G. vermiculophylla can out-compete native macrophytes in areas of I. obsoleta abundance, while facilitating reproduction of the native mud snail. This novel interaction has the potential to significantly alter biological interactions in soft sediment communities through a variety of different mechanisms, including the alteration of trophic cascades via the increase in mud snail abundance. Furthermore, facilitation of the reproductive success of I. obsoleta may lead to increases in the occurrence of cercarial dermatitis, as I. obsoleta is a known intermediate host organism.","We would like to thank J.

Constant burrowing and subsurface deposit-feeding tend to eject sediment into overlying water, break up the cohesive structure of silt-clay sediment, increase sediment-water content, and increase physical resuspension. Experimental evidence shows that resuspension of sediment is influenced by shear stress at the sediment-water interface and/or by the type, abundance and reworking time of infauna. Resuspension by biota was investigated by monitoring the turbidity of excurrent water of deposit-feeding species. The interaction between biota and physical shear in sediment resuspension was measured using an annular flume and a flume-calibrated Particle Entrainment Simulator.Sediment resuspcnsion, in the absence of physical shear, was caused by Yoldia, Macoma, and Pectinaria during the disposal of pseudofeces (20 mg/min per individual Yoldia at 20°C. The presence of motile deposit-feeders also destabilized cohesive sediment and thus increased physical resuspension. The bivalve Nucula at least doubled physical resuspension at shear values above 2 dyne/cm2.Infaunal activities such as feeding, locomotion and habitat development resulted in direct resuspension and modified physical resuspension. Total resuspension with respect to time (Rtdt) was found to equal the sum of a physical resuspension term (Rp), a biological term (Rb) and a physical-biological interaction term (Rpb). While all terms are time-varying Rp varies as a function of currents, depth and wave height and the biological terms vary with species, abundance and activity rates (temperature).",,,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology,,Elsevier,"0022-0981, 1879-1697",,1993-10,1993,,1993-10,171,2,187-200,Closed,Article,"Davis, Wayne R.","Davis, Wayne R.

In this study, we evaluated the potential effect of grazing by three microcrustaceans, Daphnia laevis, Moina micrura and Thermocyclops decipiens, on the phytoplankton community of Pampulha reservoir, a small tropical eutrophic reservoir. Four experiments were carried out over a season under laboratory conditions with the natural phytoplankton community. Selectivity coefficient and filtration rates were measured for each zooplankton species, and phytoplankton abundance was estimated. The three crustaceans grazed selectively upon the same phytoplankton species, although the species selected were seasonally different between the experiments. Nevertheless, most algal species did not show a significant decrease due to grazing. Only Daphnia laevis, in one of the experiments, produced evident changes in the structure of the dominant groups of the phytoplankton community. The abundance of total phytoplankton available for the microcrustaceans (1.00–4.49 mg C L−1) was always above the threshold food concentration values reported in the literature. Therefore, grazer production could be supported almost exclusively by phytoplankton during most of the year. Food abundance was probably the reason for the almost undetectable top-down effect by the microcrustaceans and the lack of differences among them. These observations provide evidence of the inability of zooplankton to shape and control the phytoplankton community in this tropical system. It is possible that other herbivores such as fish play the role of main consumers of the algal community.",We wish to thank R.M.

However, many factors that underlie the plant invasion process are not well known. There is evidence that some plant traits can be indicators of the degree of invasiveness in woody plants. However, root characters, such as the quantity and diversity of secondary metabolites, have been poorly studied. Flavonoids are widely distributed metabolites in plants and are involved in important biological interactions that take place in the soil. They have been related to increases in defense against pathogens, communication with mutualistic organisms, particularly with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen fixing bacteria, and with allelopathic effects on neighboring plants. If flavonoids are costly to produce and/or implicated in novel interactions established by successful woody invaders, we could expect invasive species to produce unique flavonoids compared to non-invasive ones. We assessed the literature to evaluate whether the production of flavonoids in roots vary among woody invasive and non-invasive species. Specifically, we tested the effect of invasive status on flavonoid richness, composition, and abundance in roots. We also assessed for indicator flavonoids whose presence and abundance reflect the invasive status. Invasive woody species had higher flavonoid richness in roots than non-invasive, particularly within the chemical subgroups flavonols and flavones. Our results suggest that root flavonoids play an important role in determining the invasion success of woody plants.","The authors wish to acknowledge the assistance of the Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET) and the Universidad Nacional de Córdoba (U.N.C), both of which have provided facilities used for this study.

One hypothesis in agricultural ecology is that fine-grain spatial heterogeneity in cropping (many small agricultural fields) should provide better pest control than coarse-grain heterogeneity (few large agricultural fields); this hypothesis has been proposed as an explanation for the increased pest abundance associated with agricultural intensification. However, empirical studies have found mixed support for this hypothesis, and some, surprisingly, demonstrate a strong decrease in pest abundance with increased crop aggregation. We developed a spatially explicit simulation model of pest movement across an agricultural landscape to uncover basic processes that could reduce pest abundance in landscapes with fewer, larger fields. This model focuses on herbivore movement and does not include predation effects or other biological interactions. We found that field aggregation in the model led to severely reduced pest densities and further discovered that this relationship was due to an increased distance between fields and a decreased “target area” in more aggregated landscapes. The features that create a negative relationship between aggregation and pest densities rely on crop rotation and limited dispersal capabilities of the pests. These findings help to explain seemingly counter-intuitive empirical studies and provide an expectation for when field aggregation may reduce pest populations in agro-ecosystems.","We thank Soroush Parsa for guidance on the biology of the potato weevil system and Stephen Ellner, Anurag Agrawal, and their respective labs for comments on the manuscript.

We are especially interested in ways in which species-specific properties, including colony size and shape (diatoms) and motility (flagellates and photosynthetic ciliates) interact with physical processes to regulate phytoplankton dynamics and spatial-temporal distribution patterns. We wish to understand these processes in sufficient detail to be able to predict bloom dynamics, biodiversity, size structure, and the impact of species-specific characteristics of the phytoplankton on ocean optics. Our objective is to evaluate and refine the techniques needed to test the hypothesis that brief exposure to high turbulence levels (such as those occurring during episodic wind events) will break long chains of fragile diatom species and damage or even kill individual cells of sensitive species thus altering the particle characteristics, size structure, and composition of the phytoplankton community and the resulting bulk optical properties of the water column. We are particularly interested in testing and refining the ability of our CytoSense submersible scanning flow cytometer to quantify in situ not only the abundance, length and bio-optical characteristics of large non-spheroid phytoplankton, but also the occurrence of broken chains and damaged or dead cells. We are also interested in testing our lab-based models that predict that growth, chain length and morphology of large chain forming diatoms are affected by sustained exposure to low and moderate levels of turbulence during bloom development.",,,,,,,,2010-09,2010,,,,,,Closed,Article,"Donaghay, Percy L.; Rines, Jan; Sullivan, James","Donaghay, Percy L.

Biological invasions may obviate these coevolved recognition systems resulting in biological interactions with native species that range from novelty advantages to disadvantages for the introduced species. Predator recognition initiates responses that can affect other community members through trait-mediated indirect interactions. In this study we use the Australian invasion of a marine, predatory crab (Carcinus maenas) to determine if populations of a native whelk (Haustrum vinosum) with different histories of Carcinus invasion (no previous exposure, 20 years of exposure and 100 years of exposure) recognize and respond to the introduced crab. Haustrum were subsampled from invaded and uninvaded populations then monitored for foraging behavior, shell growth and tissue growth while maintained in a common garden setting with and without waterborne cues from Carcinus. We found that both invaded and uninvaded populations of Haustrum recognize and respond to Carcinus by reducing shell growth and foraging. In feeding experiments, Carcinus showed a preference for small whelks but not thin-shelled whelks. Our results suggest that introduced populations of Carcinus in Australia do not benefit from a novelty advantage and that the induced morphological changes in Haustrum are not a defense, per se. Haustrum’s induced behavioral response to Carcinus may be more important in reducing predation than morphological defenses, and further propagate the invasive crab’s impacts.","Support was provided by an ARCIF grant to J.W., A.F., C.H. and M.C.

Although these populations are the source of seed supplies for the Chilean mussel culture industry (annual production around 250 thousand Tons), knowledge about natural populations is scarce. Based on video transect recordings, this study carries out research into one of the principal mussel beds and its associated epibenthic community in the Reloncaví Fjord, both along cross-shore and along-shore distribution gradients.ResultsMytiluschilensis was observed between the middle intertidal zone and the upper subtidal zone (between approximately 9 and 26 psu), with a richer associated community towards the subtidal zone and the fjord mouth. The mussel Condition Index (total meat weight/shell length*100) in the intertidal zone was significantly greater than in the subtidal zone, which raises questions about the reproductive contribution of mussels along the intertidal mid-subtidal gradient.ConclusionsSalinity and tidal variations, together with biological interactions, would seem to be key factors for explaining M. chilensis spatial distribution in the Reloncaví fjord, where beds appear to be in a contraction stage, as evidenced by M. chilensis scarcity towards the subtidal zone. The importance of these populations and their persistence in environments with high perturbation frequency, suggests a monitoring program should be implemented that considers both population spatial distribution and the changing environmental conditions.","This study was financed by FONDECYT Project No. 1130716.

(2) Is the mean seed production per syconium higher in the larger forest fragments? Fifty-six trees of F. adhatodifolia were visited in a year, in five fragments and one urban area in southern Brazil. Mature syconia were collected and the seed and wasp production between areas were compared. Considering all forest remnants, we recorded syconia production throughout the year, but no fragment exhibited crop production in all months. The pollinator wasps Tetrapus sp. were found in almost all syconium, thus, indicating that Ficus-pollinator mutualism was not lost. Nevertheless, smaller fragments were not capable of maintaining reproductive individuals throughout the year, therefore, requiring pollinator wasps from other fragments. The size of fragments did not influence seed production [LRT P value = 0.1; LR stat (χ2) = 4.64; n = 370]. Factors such as Ficus resilience and pollinating wasp migration may have contributed to the support of mutualism so far. Therefore, in highly fragmented landscapes such as the study region, the conservation of all forest remnants is essential to mutualistic interaction preservation. This procedure combined with the restoration of degraded areas determined by law are urgent and necessary for the conservation of regional biodiversity.","The authors thank the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior and Fundação Araucária for the PELD-MANP Grant (process number 441540/2016-3).

The seasonal flood pulse may influence this interaction, but there is no information in the literature about the effects that flood events may have on macrophytes assemblages and its associated effects on fish assemblages. Thus, this article aimed to investigate whether species richness, evenness and similarities in fish assemblage composition differed between littoral areas vegetated with macrophytes and unvegetated areas, before and after a flood. We sampled three lakes in the floodplain of the upper Paraná River basin. Sampling was conducted before (December 2004 and January 2005) and after (early March, late March and May 2005) a flood event. Overall, species richness and evenness were higher in macrophytes-covered areas. Before the flood, the composition of fish assemblages was distinct when comparing vegetated and unvegetated areas. After the flood, the similarity in fish assemblage composition was higher, indicating a homogenization effect of floods for fish inhabiting littoral areas of floodplain lakes. After the flood, opportunistic species dominated the fish assemblages in aquatic macrophytes, apparently restructuring assemblages in the littoral, restarting a succession process. Thus, the observed homogenization effect of the flood could minimize biological interactions and could induce fish assemblages to begin a new process of structurization.","We sincerely thank João Dirço Latini, Sebastião Rodrigues and other technicians that helped during samplings.

The planktonic and benthic environments are heterogeneous physically, chemically, and biologically when viewed on the spatial scale of a macroalgal propagule. Macroalgal propagules coexist in the plankton with a wide diversity of other microscopic organisms but we are limited largely to speculation in matters concerning the importance of various biological interactions in the planktonic microenvironments. The layer of water near the bottom where propagules attach is called the boundary layer and is physically, chemically, and biologically distinct from the water above it. Many physical and chemical properties of the boundary layer environment are consequences of the metabolic or secretory activities of the organisms which inhabit the microbial film, but many properties are also influenced by abiogenic factors. Nutrient concentrations in some patches are likely to be much higher than those measured in the water column using standard techniques. Chemical morphogens or toxins may also be produced by bacteria and other microorganisms in the boundary layer. Once a macroalgal propagule firmly attaches to the bottom, competition with other algae becomes more likely than in the plankton and interspecific competition involving germlings has the potential to be very important in regulating macroalgal assemblages. Also, recently settled macroalgal spores and germlings are potential prey for a diverse array of benthic grazers. Motile propagules have the potential ability to actively influence their position in the microenvironment through behaviours such as phototaxis, chemotaxis, settlement stimulation, and active selection of surface depressions.",,,British Phycological Journal,,Taylor & Francis,0007-1617,,1992-09,1992,,1992-09,27,3,253-270,Closed,Article,"Amsler, Charles D.; Reed, Daniel C.; Neushul, Michael","Amsler, Charles D.

Attached benthic communities on rocky, south‐facing shores were sampled at 0.1, 0.3, 0.7, and 1.5 m depths. Multivariate redundancy analysis explained 58% of the variance in algal communities and 75% of the variance in invertebrate communities. Algal composition was determined most by photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) fluxes, whereas the composition of associated invertebrates was driven by a combination of exposure to solar radiation and food quality and quantity. Communities on rock surfaces exposed to high solar fluxes in these lakes had very high concentrations of a photoprotective scytonemin‐like pigment (SLP‐A), and were dominated by filamentous green algae. Conversely, deeper, more shielded communities were dominated by diatoms and had low concentrations of SLP‐A. This suggests that previous paleolimnological evidence of SLP‐A increases might reflect changes in littoral attached algal communities rather than planktonic ones. Decreases in DOC concentrations as a result of climate warming will result in increased penetration of solar radiation in boreal lakes. As a result, in the event of decreased precipitation, we predict that the dominance of UVR‐resistant epilithic algae in littoral zones will occur in deeper waters than before, with coincident reductions in densities of many invertebrate taxa in algal biofilms increasingly exposed to high solar fluxes.",,,Limnology and Oceanography,,Wiley,"0024-3590, 1939-5590",,2003-01-17,2003,2003-01-17,2003-01,48,1,31-47,Closed,Article,"Donahue, William F.; Turner, Michael A.; Findlay, David L.; Leavitt, Peter R.","Donahue, William F.

After 12 months, multidimensional scaling defined five faunal clusters that were dictated primarily by the presence or absence of eelgrass rather than sandprawns. By 18 months, eelgrass and sandprawns played equal roles in defining faunal clusters. After 30 months, sandprawns had displaced the eelgrass transplants and faunal composition converged on that of sandflat control plots.Most species were either ‘eelgrass-associated’ or ‘sandflat-associated’, but three had unique responses to the treatments: two high-shore species (Assiminea globulus and Hydrobia sp.) that were abundant in eelgrass beds never appeared in the eelgrass transplants, whereas another eelgrass-occupant, Siphonaria compressa, became superabundant on the transplants for 18 months.Unexpectedly, the eelgrass fauna was never more rich or diverse than that of unvegetated sandflats, although abundance was greater in the eelgrass. As hypothesised, the sandflats were disproportionally populated by burrowers and eelgrass by non-burrowers, but a second hypothesis that these habitats should support mainly hard-bodied and soft-bodied animals respectively was rejected.The distinctively different faunas of eelgrass and unvegetated sandflats are seemingly respectively maintained by sediment stabilisation by eelgrass versus bioturbation by sandprawns. The transplants of eelgrass into sandflats developed an eelgrass-associated fauna provided sandprawns were excluded, but ultimately reverted to a sandflat fauna once sandprawns reinvaded.","Funding was provided by grants to GMB from the National Research Foundation (NRF), the South African Network for Coastal and Oceanographic Research (SANCOR), the Andrew Mellon Foundation and the University of Cape Town, and a bursary awarded to TS by the NRF.

Background
Most plants have a hyphosphere, the thin zone of soil around extraradical hyphae of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, which extends beyond the rhizosphere. This important interface has critical roles in plant mineral nutrition and water acquisition, biotic and abiotic stress resistance, mineral weathering, the formation of soil macroaggregates and aggregate stabilization, carbon (C) allocation to soils and interaction with soil microbes.ScopeThis review focuses on the hyphosphere of AM fungi and critically appraises the important findings related to the hyphosphere processes, including physical, chemical and biological properties and functions. We highlight ecological functions of AM fungal hyphae, which have profound impacts on global sustainability through biological cycling of nutrients, C sequestration in soil, release of greenhouse gas emissions from soil and the diversity and dynamics of the microbial community in the vicinity of the extraradical hyphae.ConclusionsAs a critical interface between AM fungi and soil, hyphosphere processes and their important ecological functions have begun to be understood and appreciated, and are now known to be implicit in important soil processes. Recent studies provide new insights into this crucial zone and highlight how the hyphosphere might be exploited as a nature-based solution, through understanding of interactions with the microbiome and the impacts on key processes governing resource availability, to increase sustainability of agriculture and minimize its environmental impact. Uncovering hyphosphere chemical and biological processes and their subsequent agricultural, ecological and environmental consequences is a critical research activity.","This study was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFD190090104), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U1703232, 31872184) and the Natural Science Foundation of Henan Province (222300420044).

Our objectives were to analyze its mycorrhizal networks; and, with this data, to identify potential facilitator plants and it's most important mycorrhizal fungal links. This information could be used together in assisted migration programs to connect Abies religiosa saplings to their mycorrhizal network and improve their field establishment. We collected 47 rhizosphere samples from 19 plant species and sequenced their fungal ITS2 region by Illumina. In the whole fungal community, 464 species were mycorrhizal fungi with assigned guild (32%). In this subset, 85 fungi are arbuscular, 365 ectomycorrhizal and 14 from orchid-mycorriza. The Abies religiosa bipartite network is low nested and highly modular, and has a scale-free architecture. Besides Abies religiosa, the plants with the largest degree and the lowest average shortest path were Salix paradoxa, Muhlenbergia spp., and Baccharis conferta. The most important fungal nodes are species of Cortinarius, Genea, Rhodoscypha, Russula, and Tomentella. We suggest to evaluate the Abies ' future establishment in the following scheme: in the first year reintroduce Muhlenbergia spp., and Baccharis conferta, in the second year Salix paradoxa, and in the third year–once the mycorrhizal network is reestablished– Abies religiosa' saplings in close proximity of these plants. This scheme is proposed using the data and network analyses of the present study.","AAM is grateful to the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONACYT) for financial support of Sc.D. studies (grant 374558).

566,pub.1133741668,10.1111/ecog.05379,,,,Ecological drivers of avian community assembly along a tropical elevation gradient,"Community assembly theory hypothesizes that two main niche‐based processes act to shape composition and organization of biological assemblages: abiotic filtering and biological interactions. Here, we conducted repeated surveys of bird abundance along an undisturbed elevational gradient in the tropical Andes to investigate 1) signals of deterministic processes driving community assembly and 2) potential mechanisms by which these forces operate (temperature, habitat complexity, fruit and insect availability), while correcting for imperfect detection and modeling species abundances with N‐mixture models. We observed strong signals of abiotic filtering driving functionally and phylogenetically clustered assemblages towards higher elevations, and a weaker signal of limiting similarity resulting in few overdispersed assemblages at lower elevations. Whereas the decay in species richness with increasing elevation was explained by temperature, trait and phylogenetic dispersion were explained by both temperature and vegetation structure, implying that an interplay of abiotic and biotic mechanisms determines abundance‐based community structure in our montane assemblages. Interestingly, trait and phylogenetic dispersion consistently decreased until ~3000 m but increased above this elevation, highlighting a potential role of competition in resource‐scarce habitats. Combined, our findings suggest abiotic filters are still the main process shaping montane biotas across elevations, whereas resource availability might act locally upon assemblages further modifying them. Our study challenges recent studies in tropical mountains that suggest that biotic filters are a stronger force than abiotic filters in shaping tropical montane assemblages, and exemplifies how accounting for imperfect detection might overcome potential biases in detecting environmental filtering signals in community assembly studies.",,,Ecography,,Wiley,"0906-7590, 1600-0587",,2020-12-21,2020,2020-12-21,2021-04,44,4,574-588,Closed,Article,"Montaño‐Centellas, Flavia A.; Loiselle, Bette A.; Tingley, Morgan W.","Montaño‐Centellas, Flavia A.

However, they can also be exposed to the attack of new herbivores that they might not be able to tolerate. Hence, invertebrate communities can be influenced by invasive non-native plants, which in turn modify interactions and change environmental conditions. In this study, we examined the compositional and trophic diversity of invertebrate species, comparing ecosystems with and without the plant species Carpobrotus edulis in coastal areas in its native (South Africa) and introduced (Iberian Peninsula) ranges. Results show that C. edulis has a clear impact on invertebrate communities in its non-native range, reducing their abundance in invaded areas, and particularly affecting certain trophic groups. Invasive C. edulis also alters the invertebrate diversity by not only reducing abundance but also by altering species composition. Overall, the physical dominance of C. edulis modifies the co-occurrence of invertebrate assemblages, reducing the number of trophic groups and leading to substantial effects on primary consumers. Results suggest that the lack of natural enemies might be an important driver of the expansion of C. edulis in its introduced range. Further work is needed to examine long-term changes caused by non-native plants on invertebrate assemblages and the subsequent modification of biological interactions.","This work was funded by Xunta de Galicia, Spain (CITACA Strategic Partnership, Reference: ED431E 2018/07) and carried out within the framework of the project “Retos en la gestión de la planta invasora Carpobrotus edulis.

                    P. granulosus
                    dominating in the upper levels (up to 73% of emersion and 22°C),
                    P. granulosus
                    and
                    P. violaceus
                    coexisting in the middle levels (48% of emersion and 21.6°C), and
                    A. angulosus
                    dominating in the lower levels (below 20% of emersion and 17.8°C). Size distribution for
                    P. granulosus

Temperature and emersion gradients strongly affected the species richness, abundance and mean size of the species across the intertidal, thus clearly influencing the occurrence and distribution patterns of the species studied. The ability of the upper-middle shore species to tolerate high levels of temperature and emersion is suggested to explain their distribution patterns. Size distribution differences might have been caused by biological interactions as intra and interspecific competition.

Such regulatory role may be of special relevance in novel communities resulting from biological invasions. Non-indigenous species frequently escape natural predators that limit their distribution and abundance in the native range. However, biological interactions also can limit the establishment and spread of non-native populations. There is a growing concern that climate change might affect predator–prey interactions exacerbating the ecological impacts of non-indigenous species. However, mechanisms underlying such interactions are poorly understood in marine ecosystems. Here, we explored if past environmental stress, i.e., increasing temperature and decreasing pH, could affect the vulnerability of two mussel prey, the native Mytilus galloprovincialis and the non-indigenous Xenostrobus securis, to predation by the native dogwhelk Nucella lapillus. In addition, we evaluated the consequences on the feeding behaviour of N. lapillus. First, we exposed monospecific assemblages of each mussel species to combined experimental conditions of increasing temperature and decreasing pH in mesocosms for 3weeks. Then assemblages were placed on a rocky shore and were enclosed in cages with dogwhelks where they remained for 3weeks. Despite the lack of preference, consumption was much greater on the native than on the invasive mussels, which barely were consumed by dogwhelks. However, this trend was diverted when temperature increased. Thus, under a coastal warming scenario shifts in dogwhelks feeding behaviour may help to contain invader's populations, especially in estuarine areas where these predators are abundant.","This research was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation-FEDER (CLINVA PROJECT CGL2009-07205) and FCT project CLEF (PTDC/AAC-AMB/102866/2008), FA was partially supported by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the COMPETE - Operational Competitiveness Programme and national funds through FCT Foundation for Science and Technology, under the project Pest-C/MAR/LA0015/2013.

Studies on the effect of water-level fluctuations are scarce and restricted to Europe and Australia. In the Río Tercero Reservoir (Argentina), the management policies of a nuclear-power plant require a minimum depth of 650 m. During periods of excessive rainfall, however, the input is such that the excess passes over the spillway, thus causing a high turnover of water. Phytoplankton, zooplankton, and physicochemical variables were monitored over 2 years at three sampling stations during a period with annual precipitation higher than the historical annual mean. Different hydrological situations occurred based on precipitation, spillway outflow, and water-renewal rate. At high renewal rates, phyto- and zoo-plankton diversities peaked. During high outflow periods phytoplankton biomass peaked through the contribution of Ceratium hirundinella. Once the spillway outflow ceased, stable conditions (low renewal rates) were achieved, thus allowing the onset of biological interactions. Maximum phytoplankton density (mainly Actinocyclus normanii) was reached at such times, and efficient grazers (Daphnia laevis) with long life cycles dominated in terms of biomass. The structure and dynamics of the plankton community could be altered by changes in hydrological conditions (renewal rate and spillway outflow) that act to compromise the apparent stability imposed by steady water levels. These variables must be considered to identify disturbance conditions and improve knowledge of reservoir environments, so as to implement appropriate management practices.","We thank A.

Some of these results have contributed to make the current systems of classifications more concordant. Recent studies on Cretaceous fossils are related to present–day angiosperms and their floral types. It is concluded that pleiomerous flowers with helically arranged parts (corresponding to the Magnolia type, though probably less elaborate), on the basis of recent evidence can still be regarded as the probably earliest floral type in angiosperms. But the trimerous flowers must also have appeared very early, at least in the Albian. There is also evidence that the monocotyledons had differentiated as a separate group at that time. Similarities between certain extant monocotyledons and certain dicotyledons, in particular between some Dios–coreales and some Annonales–Aristolochiales, indicate that the monocotyledons had their roots in early Cretaceous pro–Magnoliiflorae. Fossil petaliferous flowers from Cenomanian layers, and later of a variety of flower types, such as the obdiplostemo–nous, petaliferous, epigynous Scandianthus (similar to extant saxifragaceous genera), or flowers with secondarily pleiomerous androecia of the theaceous type are discussed in relation to the distribution of corresponding floral types in extant dicotyledons.

Stock size is highly variable from year to year due to the impact of the unstable physical environment on fish early stages. Biophysical models of early life‐stage dispersal of marine organisms have been built by coupling (i) hydrodynamic models and (ii) life history models (i.e. egg and larva stages), and are therefore useful tools to investigate physical–biological interactions. Here, we review biophysical models of anchovy and sardine ichthyoplankton dispersals developed in the Benguela, Humboldt and Canary Current upwelling ecosystems. We also include a similar study conducted in the California Current upwelling on zooplankton. We then integrate this information into a comparative analysis of sardine and anchovy reproductive strategies in the different systems. We found that the main spawning periods match the season of (i) maximal simulated ichthyoplankton retention over the continental shelf in the northern Benguela, southern Humboldt and Canary (for sardine); (ii) maximal food concentration in the southern Benguela, California and Canary (for anchovy); and (iii) maximal shelf retention of ichthyoplankton and food concentration in the northern Humboldt (for both anchovy and sardine). This specificity of the northern Humboldt ecosystem could explain why it sustains the largest small pelagic fish stock. Finally, the possible effects of climate change on these patterns are discussed.","This work was supported by EUR‐OCEANS, a European Network of Excellence co‐funded by the European Commission (6th Framework Program, contract 511106).

(Environ. Ecol. Stat., 2 (1995) 1–14), consisting of local and global approaches. Multivariate ordination procedures are applied that take spatial components into account explicitly through the construction of a neighbourhood graph between closely placed sampling sites, which is then used to weight the data. The result is a decomposition of spatial structure on local and global scales. This method is for the first time applied to macrobenthic data of this region. It shows the underlying importance of spatial scaling in analysis and proves to offer more information than classical ordination methods such as correspondence analysis, which may confuse the two different spatial scales. Global analysis is proposed as a powerful tool to define species assemblages and local analysis as an additional instrument to define partitions resulting from biological interactions. Additionally, this method appears capable of incorporating rare species (which influence classical analyses, often resulting in their elimination from datasets) by minimising their effects on the global scale and conversely maximising them on the local scale. This analysis demonstrates the importance of explicitly incorporating spatial information into the detection and interpretation of patterns in a macrobenthic community.",This work contributed to the ‘GDR Manche’ study under the PNDR programme under the co-ordination of Dr Louis Cabioch and Professor Christian Retière.

They experience large variability across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales, with complex external and internal drivers. Organisms influence pH at a patch scale, where community metabolic effects and hydrodynamic processes interact to produce broad ranges in pH, (∼0.3–0.5 pH units) over daily cycles and spatial scales (mm to m) particularly in shallow vegetated habitats and coral reefs where both respiration and photosynthetic activity are intense. Biological interactions at the ecosystem scale, linked to patchiness in habitat landscapes and seasonal changes in metabolic processes and temperature lead to changes of about 0.3–0.5 pH units throughout a year. Furthermore, on the scale of individual organisms, small-scale processes including changes at the Diffusive Boundary Layer (DBL), interactions with symbionts, and changes to the specific calcification environment, induce additional changes in excess of 0.5 pH units.In these highly variable pH environments calcifying organisms have developed the capacity to alter the pH of their calcifying environment, or specifically within critical tissues where calcification occurs, thus achieving a homeostasis. This capacity to control the conditions for calcification at the organism scale may therefore buffer the full impacts of ocean acidification on an organism scale, although this might be at a cost to the individual. Furthermore, in some areas, calcifiers may potentially benefit from changes to ambient seawater pH, where photosynthetic organisms drawdown CO2.","This is a contribution to projects MEDEICG funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (CTM2009-07013), MedSEA of the FP7 of the EU (contract # FP7-ENV-2010-265103), and the CSIRO Carbon Cluster.

Apart from morphological adaptations and the typical secondary deformations that some parasitic isopods inflict on their host's exoskeleton, traces of feeding behaviours involving isopods on their victim/food are seldom fossilized. Many of these rare occurrences consist of cases for which the degree of association between the isopods and their potential food source is unclear, or the interaction only very briefly explained (recently analysed cases excepted). There are two limiting problems in identifying the biological nature of fossilized associations: (1) direct associations of organisms preserved as ‘imprint’ (as opposed to inclusions in cherts or amber) are shaped by several taphonomic events difficult to identify (such as the time of death, burial and fossilization of the organism); (2) even in modern nature, differences within syn vivo interactions (like parasitism and micropredation) are poorly understood in marine systems. We report the occurrence of isopods associated with ancient chondrichthyans which also represent rare cases of the preservation of several fossil isopods on larger organisms. These organisms are adult electric rays of the genus †Titanonarke Carvalho from the late Ypresian (Eocene) of the Monte Postale site, Bolca Lagerstätte, Italy. By examining: (1) the involved lineages of rays and isopods; (2) the taphonomy of the association; (3) its environmental context; and (4) biological/adaptive features; we identify this association as a selective case, either of ancient scavenging or of micropredation on specific electric rays by isopods.","We firstly want to warmly acknowledge R.

Oyster reef construction (or restoration) can therefore be expected to have wide ranging effects, from increased refuge for organisms, to lower turbidity. We measured changes in sediment characteristics and benthic nutrient fluxes near a constructed intertidal oyster reef in the Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve in NE Florida, USA. Within one year of reef construction, particle size distribution shifted towards finer sediment, and organic matter content increased to 7.3% ± 2.1 (standard error) compared to 2.9% ± 0.8 (standard error) at control sites, where oysters were absent. After three years, up to 15 cm of this fine, organic-rich sediment had accreted immediately shoreward of the reef. In benthic flux experiments performed under dark conditions, reef sediments released 167 μM/m2/hr NH4 + compared to –4 μM/m2/hr from control site sediments. Under light conditions both reef and control fluxes were insignificant. This was presumably due to uptake by benthic microalgae; chlorophyll a concentrations were 3 times higher in reef sediments compared to controls. Deposition of organic rich sediment near oyster reefs might render important ecosystem services from carbon burial and perhaps increased denitrification. However, burial of live oysters with excessive sediment accretion might threaten reef success in some cases. Our results highlight the complexity of physical-biological interactions and the need for complete assessment of ecosystem services in order to optimize design and thoroughly evaluate restoration outcomes.",,,Journal of Coastal Zone Management,,OMICS International,2473-3350,,2017,2017,2017,,20,1,,Closed,Article,"Southwell, Melissa W; Veenstra, Jessica J; Adams, Charles D; Scarlett, Elizabeth V; Payne, Kristy B","Southwell, Melissa W (); Veenstra, Jessica J (); Adams, Charles D (); Scarlett, Elizabeth V (); Payne, Kristy B ()",,"Southwell, Melissa W (); Veenstra, Jessica J (); Adams, Charles D (); Scarlett, Elizabeth V (); Payne, Kristy B ()",,,,,,,,,,,12,9,,2.03,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1085402559,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 41 Environmental Sciences,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,

Here we report evidence on the effect of canopy closure on non-random patterns in the functional structure of herbaceous plant communities in temperate forest. We evaluated SLA (specific leaf area), leaf area and shape, dry matter content, presence of rhizomes, and plant height and inclination. In one of the three sites surveyed we found clear patterns of both trait-convergence and trait-divergence. Along the canopy closure gradient we observed communities formed by species with large SLA and long and narrow leaves being replaced by communities formed by species with smaller SLA and rounded leaves, which we interpret as environmental filtering producing such a trait-convergence. Further, communities located in more open sites contained more distinct species in terms of SLA, leaf area and leaf shape, i.e., indicating a divergence pattern along the canopy closure gradient. The other study sites showed no significant patterns when analyzed alone. When the three sites were analyzed jointly, a significant pattern of convergence for plant inclination was found.

Population ecology plays a central role in conservation ecology. Persistence of the metapopulation rather than that of each local population should be pursued in species conservation management. Biological interactions essential to reproduction and soil seed bank components of the population should be investigated and applied to planning for the conservation of a plant population. Gravelly floodplains and moist tall grasslands are among typical riparian habitats containing many threatened plants in Japan. These riparian habitats are now subjected not only to heavy fragmentation but also to intensive invasion of highly competitive alien (nonnative) plants. Extreme habitat isolation may result in reproductive failure or fertility selection in a plant population without pollinators, as exemplified by a nature reserve population of Primula sieboldii. Biological invasions, which are facilitated by extensive changes in the river environment including decreased seasonal flooding, abandonment of traditional vegetation management, eutrophication, and extensive clearing of the land for recreational use, threaten endemic riparian species. To preserve safe sites and growing conditions for threatened plants such as Aster kantoensis, active management to suppress the dominance of alien invader plants is necessary. Population management and habitat restoration should be based on sound information on the population ecology of both threatened and alien invader plants, designed as an ecological experiment to clarify effective ways for management.",,,Population Ecology,,Wiley,"1438-3896, 1438-390X",,2001-12,2001,2018-11-29,2001-12,43,3,189-195,Closed,Article,"Washitani, I.","Washitani, I.

Spatial patterns of freshwater fish species at regional and local scales were investigated to explore the possible role of interspecific interactions in influencing distribution and abundance within communities occupying coastal streams of North‐Western France. 2. Nine sites from nine streams situated in the same biogeographical region were sampled annually over the 6‐year period from 1990 to 1995. 3. Similar habitats (sites) with richer regional colonization pools exhibited proportionally richer local communities in terms of number of species, total density and total biomass of individuals. Furthermore, no negative relationships were found between density and biomass of each of the most common species and local species richness. 4. Results of dynamic regression models (applied to the above‐mentioned species) suggest an absence of strong competition between all pairs of species. 5. The evidence on lack of density compensation for species‐poor communities and absence of perceptible interspecific competition between species suggest that the communities studied are non‐interactive. 6. Two main explanations can be advanced. First, the local abundance of species in the communities studied could be determined through differential responses to unpredictable environmental changes, rather than through biological interactions. Second, as a result of historical events, the communities studied are reduced in congeneric species which can limit, in turn, the influence of interspecific competition in structuring these communities. 7. These results underline the strong influence of regional processes in shaping local riverine fish communities and minimize the possible influence of species interactions in governing these communities.",,,Journal of Animal Ecology,,Wiley,"0021-8790, 1365-2656",,1998-05,1998,2002-01-05,1998-05,67,3,472-484,All OA; Bronze,Article,"OBERDORFF, THIERRY; HUGUENY, BERNARD; COMPIN, ARTHUR; BELKESSAM, DJAMILA","OBERDORFF, THIERRY (Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle, Laboratoire d’Ichtyologie Générale et Appliquée, 43 rue Cuvier, 75231 Paris Cedex 5, France); HUGUENY, BERNARD (Antenne ORSTOM, Laboratoire d’Ecologie des Eaux Douces, Université Claude Bernard Lyon I, 43 Bld du 11 Novembre 1918, 69622 Villeurbanne Cedex, France); COMPIN, ARTHUR (Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle, Laboratoire d’Ichtyologie Générale et Appliquée, 43 rue Cuvier, 75231 Paris Cedex 5, France); BELKESSAM, DJAMILA (Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle, Laboratoire d’Ichtyologie Générale et Appliquée, 43 rue Cuvier, 75231 Paris Cedex 5, France)",,"OBERDORFF, THIERRY (National Museum of Natural History); HUGUENY, BERNARD (Claude Bernard University Lyon 1); COMPIN, ARTHUR (National Museum of Natural History); BELKESSAM, DJAMILA (National Museum of Natural History)",National Museum of Natural History; Claude Bernard University Lyon 1,grid.410350.3; grid.7849.2,Paris; Villeurbanne,; ,France; France,,,,,,79,4,,,,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1046/j.1365-2656.1998.00211.x,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1015674069,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,C14 Geography and Environmental Studies,14 Life Below Water

Unlike other trematode parasites, schistosomes (along with the Didymozoidae) have evolved separate sexes or dioecy. Sex is determined by a chromosomal mechanism. The dioecious state created an opportunity for the sexes to play a role in schistosome evolution that has resulted in an interesting interplay between the sexes. The classical observation, made more than 50 years ago, is that female schistosomes do not develop unless a male worm is present. Studies up through the 1990s focused on dissecting the role of the sexes in mate attraction, mate choice, mating behavior, female growth, female reproductive development, egg production, and other sex-evolved functions. In the mid-1980s, studies began to address the molecular events of male–female interactions. The classic morphological observation that female schistosomes do not complete reproductive development unless a male worm is present has been redefined in molecular terms. The male by an unknown mechanism transduces a signal that regulates female gene expression in a stage-, tissue-, and temporal-specific manner. A number of female-specific genes have been identified, along with signaling pathways and nuclear receptors, that play a role in female reproductive development. In addition, a number of host factors such as cytokines have also been demonstrated to affect adult male and female development and egg production.

Distinctive sponge faunas of Caribbean coral reefs and mangroves seem to support the assumption that abiotic factors determine sponge diversity within habitats and faunal differences between habitats because these habitats differ greatly in abiotic characteristics and because lower species diversity on mangroves appears to reflect their inferiority as sponge habitat. 2 A way to test this assumption is provided by unusual mangrove cays in Belize that are inhabited by the typical Caribbean reef sponge fauna. Reciprocal transplant experiments, combined with caging (predator‐free space) and artificial substrata (competitor‐free space), demonstrated control of community membership by biological interactions for 12 common species: spongivorous predators excluded typical mangrove sponges from reef sponge assemblages, and reef sponges were excluded from mangrove sponge assemblages by competition. 3 Variation in growth rate was related inversely to variation in defences against predators in the species studied, suggesting a trade‐off between resistance to competitors and to predators. 4 This trade‐off influences community structure, as the key importance of competition for space among mangrove species results in lower within‐habitat diversity, while multiple challenges, including predation, may maintain high diversity of reef sponges. Differences in species composition between habitats are maintained, as this trade‐off precludes success of individual species as members of both faunas. 5 Most surprising is that typical faunas of mangroves and reefs are not tied to these habitats by abiotic factors. Greater sponge species diversity on the reef does not necessarily indicate superior conditions for sponges. Instead reefs may be a refuge for species that grow too slowly to coexist with typical mangrove species.

Predicting the conditions under which such switches occur remains a key challenge for ecologists. 3 The purpose of this study was to understand how co‐habiting species of opposing effect (damselfish as habitat facilitators vs. sea urchins as habitat consumers) can directly and indirectly influence the persistence of algal habitats on a tropical coast, including their potential to initiate switches among habitat types (productive ‘turfs’ of filamentous algae vs. ‘barrens’ of encrusting algae). 4 Using a series of five independent experiments, we observed that damselfish facilitated the production of algal turfs both directly, through active farming of selected species, and indirectly, by vigorously attacking and expelling invading urchins from the local area (i.e. preventing herbivory). In contrast, urchins consumed algal turf to directly maintain barrens. 5 The negative effects of urchins on algal turf were strong enough to initiate a habitat switch from turf to barrens, but this was conditional upon the absence of damselfish and the presence of a particular species of urchin. 6 Synthesis. These results build upon our understanding of the dynamics of habitat persistence by demonstrating the conditions where biological interactions of opposing direction (positive vs. negative) maintain or switch habitat types.

554,pub.1069664812,10.2307/1942464,,,,"Diversity, Patterns of Adaptation, and Stability of Nova Scotian Kelp Beds","There are two alternate community states in the rocky subtidal of the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, an unproductive sea urchin/coralline alga community, and highly productive kelp beds dominated by Laminaria longicruris. Disease—induced mortality of the sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) triggered a switch from the first state to the second and provided a unique opportunity to study (1) the ability of L. longicruris to recover its former dominant status, and (2) its stability when competing with other seaweeds and when perturbed by storms and grazers other than urchins. Rates of recolonization of L. longicruris depended on the proximity of a refugial source of spores. When reproductive plants were nearby, a closed canopy developed within 18 mo of urchin mortality. When a reproductive population was several kilometres away, there was sparse recolonization for 3 yr, then a massive recruitment occurred with closure of the canopy in the 4th yr. Laminaria is clearly the competitive dominant in the seaweed community. Manipulative experiments showed that the kelp limits the abundance of several understory species, but there was no evidence that the abundant annual seaweeds limited kelp recruitment. When sea urchins were rare, the density and growth rates of Laminaria were influenced mostly by intraspecific competition. When the canopy of adult plants was removed there was a dramatic increase in kelp recruitment, but the recruits that grew in dense patches in the clearings were significantly smaller than those of a similar age that grew more sparsely beneath the canopy. Once the kelp recovered from destructive grazing and formed a mature forest, it was able to maintain its dominance, even in habitats subject to severe nutrient stress for 8 mo of the year. For most of the year mortality and erosion of laminae outweighed the effects of recruitment and growth, and the canopy declined, especially during winter when storms were frequent. Erosion was exacerbated by grazing of the gastropod Lacuna vincta. However, in late winter and early spring, recruitment and rapid growth restored the canopy. When severe storm damage was simulated by completely removing Laminaria in patches, the kelp rapidly recolonized and soon outgrew other seaweeds. Unlike the competitive dominants in kelp bed systems in the northeast Pacific, L. longicruris in Nova Scotia manifests multiple patterns of adaptation that enable it to dominate early and late stages of succession in a range of habitats of different levels of nutrient stress and of disturbance from storms and grazers. The principal threat to the stability of the kelp beds is destructive grazing by sea urchins. We suggest that the considerable differences between the dynamics of kelp beds in Nova Scotia and those of the northeast Pacific, and the high degree of stability of L. longicruris stands in Nova Scotia, is attributable to the low diversity of kelps and therefore low levels of competition in Nova Scotia, and to the multiple adaptations of L. longicruris that enable it to tolerate several stresses and disturbances. We argue that the dynamics of community organization, and therefore the stability properties of this system are determined primarily by biological interactions and not by physical variables. This differs from the kelp communities in the northeast Pacific, in which both biological and physical factors influence dynamics significantly at a primary level. We offer a qualitative model of the dynamics of community structure in Nova Scotia that may be viewed as a set of deterministic ""subroutines,"" in which each subroutine describes the outcome of a particular biological interaction. The subroutine(s) that predominate at one point in time and space are probably determined mostly by physical hydrographic variables that have a large stochastic component.",,,Ecological Monographs,,Wiley,"0012-9615, 1557-7015",,1988-06,1988,1988-06,1988-06,58,2,129-154,Closed,Article,"Johnson, Craig R.; Mann, Kenneth H.","Johnson, Craig R.

554,pub.1069664712,10.2307/1942223,,,,The Establishment and Development of a Marine Epifaunal Community,"Because of the nature of their substratum, the sessile invertebrate species of the marine epifaunal community living on rocks occur in discrete patterns of distribution. The rocks are finite patches or habitat islands with a limited space for colonization and growth. Such a system is ideal for studying the parameters affecting the distribution of species within a community. Also, because of the small size and immobility of the adults, the system is also ideal for studying the pattern of change in species composition and diversity within a community. This study used multiple series of manipulated experimental plates, which both duplicated natural rock surfaces and could be compared with samples of the rocks, to investigate the developmental and distributional processes of this community. Five major factors were found to be important to both the development of the community and its distribution on the rocks: (1) the selectivity of the metamorphosing larvae as to site of attachment; (2) the seasonal fluctuation in larval abundances; (3) the biological interactions within and between species; (4) the size of rock substrata; and (5) the physical disturbance of the substrata (rock turnover). Initially, the developmental process can be uncoupled from the effects of the substrate size and disturbance. Predation is relatively unimportant as a biological interaction within this community, but the species can be ranked according to their ability to compete for the available space on a substratum. This ranking implies a type of successional sequence in the development of the community; however, the sequence is greatly affected by historical components. The colonization of a substratum is directly dependent upon the abundance of settling larvae, which in turn is a function of seasonality and selectivity. The eventual competitive outcome and development of the community will depend upon which species have immigrated onto the substratum and is thus dependent upon history. The process is, therefore, open ended: colonization will be highly variable and change seasonally and, although one species may eventually dominate the substratum, it may be one of nine different species depending upon the individual history of that area. The frequency with which a substratum is disturbed (with the resultant extinction of its fauna) is a function of wave force and is inversely proportional to both the size of the substratum and the depth at which it occurs. Disturbance will determine when a substratum is initially exposed for colonization and how long it will have for development. In the shallow subtidal (mean low water to —2.5 m), the frequent disturbance of small rocks will cause them to support less than their equilibrium number of species and their fauna will reflect immediate larval abundances. Large rocks will remain stable for long periods of time and will usually be dominated by a single species. Intermediate—sized rocks (1 to 10 dm3) will remain stable long enough to develop an equilibrium number of species but will be disturbed before dominance occurs. They will thus have the highest diversity because of their 'optimal' frequency of disturbance. In deeper water (10 m) smaller rocks will be more stable. More rocks will develop dominance and the smaller size of a rock at the optimum frequency will mean that substrata at this frequency will have a lower equilibrium number of species and thus a lower diversity. The increased stability with depth will mean a lower overall diversity for the community. Lastly, the increased disturbance and lower pool size for rocks in the intertidal will also cause diversity to be lower in this area. There appears, therefore, to be an optimal frequency of disturbance at which diversity is maximized. An increase or decrease in this level causes a reduction in diversity because of a decrease in the number of species present or an increase in dominance. This optimum will vary with the physical environment and the type of community.",,,Ecological Monographs,,Wiley,"0012-9615, 1557-7015",,1977-12,1977,,1977-12,47,1,37-63,Closed,Article,"Osman, Richard W.","Osman, Richard W.

Climate change modifies geographic ranges, phenology, and biological interactions—key components of species ecological niche. Alterations in distribution ranges could decrease the size of the populations and thus threaten the persistence of the species. Here, we seek to test the Eltonian Noise Hypotheses (ENH), which states that biotic interactions do not affect species distribution at large geographical scales, using Tacinga palmadora (Cactaceae), an endemic species to the Caatinga dry forest in Brazil, as the case study. We first modeled the current distribution of T. palmadora and its pollinators, the hummingbird Chlorostilbon lucidus and the stingless bee Trigona spinipes, separately using only climatic variables. Then, we modeled T. palmadora current distribution using C. lucidus and T. spinipes distributions as input layers alongside the climatic variables. Afterwards, we projected the model to the future to predict climatic conditions for the year 2070 (average for 2061–2080), using optimistic (RCP4.5) and pessimistic (RCP8.5) greenhouse gas emission scenarios. We analyzed model performance and determined habitat suitability of the species for all models. In general, biotic interactions did not increase model performance and the best-supported models were the ones considering climatic variables only. We found that T. palmadora suitable habitats are most likely to be reduced by climate change. In this sense, our results supported the ENH and showed that T. palmadora may lose a part of its climatic envelope, already restricted by its endemism, generating negative cascade effects on the region.",,"This study was funded by the Long-term Ecological Research Program (PELD) Catimbau/CNPq, process number: 403770/2012–2 and Programa de Apoio a Núcleos de Excelência (PRONEX)/FACEPE/CNPq, process number: APQ-0138–2.05/14.

552,pub.1141136560,10.3897/biss.5.74375,,,,Classification of Biological Interactions: Challenges in the field and in analysis,"Within biological communities, species interact in a wide variety of ways. Species interactions have always been noted and classified by naturalists in describing living organisms and their ways. Moreover, they are essential to characterize ecological communities as functioning entities. Biodiversity databases, as a rule, are comprised of species records in certain localities and times. Many, if not most, originated as databases of museum specimens and/or published records. As such, they provide data on species occurrences and distribution, with little functional information. Currently, online databases for species interaction data are being formed or proposed. Usually, these databases set out to compile data from actual field studies, and their design reflects the singularities of particular studies that seed their development. In two online databases: the Web of Life (2021) and the Interaction Web DataBase (2020) (IWDB), the categories of interactions are quite heterogeneous (Table 1). For instance, they may refer explicitly to certain taxonomic groups (e.g., anemone-fish), or do so implicitly (host-parasitoid; parasitoids are all holometabolous insects with arthropod hosts); conversely, they may encompass almost any taxon (food webs). In another example, the Global Biotic Interactions database (Poelen et al. 2014) (GloBI) offers a choice of relational attributes when entering data, ranging from undefined to quite restricted (Table 2). Here we intend to contribute to the development of interaction databases, from two different points of view. First, what categories can be effectively applied to field observations of biotic interactions? Second, what theoretical and applied questions do we expect to address with interaction databases? These should be equally applicable to comparisons of studies of the same kind or mode of interaction, and to contrasts between interactions in multimodal studies.",,,Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,,Pensoft Publishers,2535-0897,,2021-09-14,2021,2021-09-14,,5,,e74375,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pinheiro, Rafael B.

Over this time, a parallel increase in HABs has also been observed in the Chilean southern austral region (Patagonia fjords). HAB species like Alexandrium catenella—responsible for Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP)—are of great public concern due to their negative socioeconomic impacts and significant northward geographical range expansion. Many toxic dinoflagellate species (like A. catenella) produce benthic resting cysts, yet a holistic understanding of the physical-chemical and biological conditions influencing the distributions of cysts in this region is lacking. In this study, we measured a combination of hydrographic (temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen) and sediment physical-chemical properties (temperature, pH and redox potential), in addition to meiofaunal abundances –as sediment bioturbators and potential cyst predators– to determine the factors influencing dinoflagellate cyst distribution, with emphasis on A. catenella in and around a “hotspot” area of southern Chile. An analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) test revealed significant differences (p < 0.011) in cyst assemblages between the fjords and oceanic environments. Permutational Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) showed significant effects of sediment temperature and silt proportion in explaining differences in the cyst assemblages. A generalized linear model (GLM) indicated that sediment temperature, silt/sand, anoxic conditions, and low abundances of Harpacticoida —a meiofauna herbivore group and potential bioturbator— are associated with the higher resting cyst abundances of the harmful species A. catenella. The implications for A. catenella resting cysts dynamics are discussed, highlighting physical-chemical and biological interactions and their potential for PSP outbreak initiation.","This work was funded by Comité Oceanográfico Nacional [CONA-C24F, 2018] by projects CONA C24F 18-06 (Patricio A.

In lizards, competition and predation are major forces influencing distribution and abundance, but there is also increasing evidence pointing at the influence of habitat structure and prey abundance. Our work explored the latter further by quantifying the effects of vegetation and prey abundance on occupancy and abundance (i.e., estimated probability of detecting more than two individuals) of two sympatrically occurring species in the northern karst belt of Puerto Rico. We hypothesized that Anolis cristatellus would occur in trunkground substrates and Anolis krugi on grassbush substrates according to their ecomorphological classification. We also hypothesized that prey abundance, a component of habitat quality, would have a positive and strong effect on occupancy and abundance. Anolis cristatellus exhibited high occupancy rates (>0.80), influenced by mid-story tree size. A. cristatellus abundance fluctuated over time, with highest probability of detecting two or more individuals in JanuaryMarch and JulySeptember when prey abundance transitioned from low to high levels. Occupancy of A. krugi was positively influenced by sapling density and prey abundance. Prey abundance exerted a stronger influence on occupancy, but its influence on abundance was negative and strong. Biological interactions and the type of understory substrates may explain the negative relationship. Our study supported predicted relationships between ecomorphology and habitat, but also showed that higher prey abundance may not always translate to higher local abundance. We shed light on these interactions, knowledge needed to advance anole conservation in the advent of land use and climate change.","We thank J. Sustache Sustache, R. Luis Rivera, and H.

552,pub.1121826173,10.1002/edn3.41,,,,A performance evaluation of targeted eDNA and eDNA metabarcoding analyses for freshwater fishes,"The use of environmental DNA analysis has revolutionized biodiversity monitoring. Initially, eDNA monitoring surveys in aquatic environments utilized a targeted approach, but there has been a steady shift toward whole community assessments (eDNA metabarcoding). Both approaches can increase the detection sensitivity for rare and elusive species, compared to more conventional methods. However, it is important to understand the benefits and limitations of targeted and whole community eDNA monitoring to tailor surveys to research questions and management objectives. Here, we aimed to test the relative merits of targeted eDNA analysis versus eDNA metabarcoding in an intermittent river system. First, samples collected during different seasons were used to assess the influence of seasonality on the detection probabilities of both methods. Second, detection probabilities from the two monitoring approaches for one focal species were compared to evaluate the sensitivity of both methods. Finally, the data from an eDNA metabarcoding survey conducted across the outer distribution limits of an invasive species were used to evaluate whether species interactions can be inferred by this method. Analyses showed that sampling intermittent river systems during low flow events increases the performance of the targeted eDNA surveys, while sampling season does not influence the performance of eDNA metabarcoding surveys. Environmental DNA metabarcoding was found to be less sensitive than a targeted monitoring approach, thus making the latter more suitable for generating detailed distribution data. Nevertheless, eDNA metabarcoding survey data can be interpreted in a semiquantitative manner and can provide insights into biological interactions. A comparison of targeted eDNA monitoring and eDNA metabarcoding showed a higher detection sensitivity for targeted surveys. Environment DNA metabarcoding surveys can, however, be used to monitor species interaction.","We wish to thank the Invasive Animals Cooperative Research Centre (Project 1.W.2) and the Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment (Project 164) for providing funding for this research.

552,pub.1101729163,10.1111/jbi.13216,,,,Drivers and constraints on floral latitudinal diversification gradients,"The latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) is a primary emergent property of the biosphere, yet the cause(s) of this pattern are still debated. Key to many hypotheses is the origins and maintenance of tropical hyperdiversity, and the role of climate in driving low latitude speciation. Here, we analyse patterns of tropical and extratropical floral diversification and migration during the early Palaeogene “greenhouse” interval, to shed further light on the relationship between climatic change, latitude and floral diversity. The early Palaeogene, from ~63 to 42 million years ago, of the US Gulf Coastal Plain (GCP) and Colombia. Terrestrial plants, using pollen and spores as a proxy. We analyse species diversity trends using coverage and sample size‐based interpolation and extrapolation, Chao1 estimated richness, and evenness metrics. Capture–mark–recapture (CMR) modelling is used to estimate origination and extinction probabilities. Origination patterns on the GCP are separated into in situ speciation versus immigration. While Colombian (tropical) palynofloral richness and origination rates increased in conjunction with warming, GCP richness remained stable. The single rise in GCP origination rates, coincident with the Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, was largely driven by the immigration of Eurasian taxa, rather than in situ origination, which was the case in Colombia. These results show that the relationships among climatic parameters and diversification and dispersal are not straightforward. While temperature may have driven diversification in the tropics, other factors, such as precipitation, insolation or biological interactions, may have constrained diversification in the extratropics. Furthermore, our results suggest that outward dispersal from the tropics was limited in the warm world of the early Palaeogene, with most GCP immigrants being sourced from other extratropical regions. These findings suggest that the tropics and extratropics may have functioned independently at this time.","We thank D. Dockery III and R. Carroll for their help and logistic support during fieldwork.

We used a suite of sampling methods (light attraction and airlift devices) to evaluate the variability of larval, post-larval and macrobenthic assemblages associated with kelp forests (Lessonia trabeculata) in Central Chile (30° to 33°S). Pelagic collections identified two assemblages: early-life stages and emerging macrobenthos, with the later contributing three quarters to the total abundance regardless of the source of illumination (permanent or flashing). Field experiments showed that moon phases affected the structure and composition of the samples. Surveys carried out during new moon showed the highest abundances and taxonomic richness of emergent assemblages. However, species composition varied in both assemblages depending on the moon phase. Although the pelagic assemblages collected at sites with contrasting upwelling intensity did not show differences in community structure, differences in composition were evident for early-life stages. The relationship between pelagic and benthic collections indicated that four decapod crustaceans were represented at both larval and early juvenile stages; however, only the high abundances and densities of Paraxanthus barbiger allowed for estimations of benthic-pelagic coupling. For this species, larval abundances and benthic juvenile densities demonstrated contrasting local and regional patterns, suggesting a decoupling between pelagic and benthic environments. These findings highlight the differential variability in smaller components of kelp forests, but also suggest that post-settlement processes may be driving biological interactions through these highly productive and complex environments.","The authors would like to thank several people who provided logistical support.

552,pub.1083527258,10.1002/lno.10445,,,,Changes in epilithic fungal communities under different light conditions in a river: A field experimental study,"In lotic ecosystems, the community structure of periphytic fungi changes depending on the quantity and quality of allochthonous organic matter supplied. However, little is known about the effects of the input of autochthonous organic matter on the community structure. To examine the relationship between a periphytic fungal community grown on inorganic substrates and the algal production, we performed field experiments. If the fungal species differ in their relative ability to exploit allochthonous and autochthonous organic matter, the species composition of the fungal community might differ between shaded conditions, without algal production, and light conditions, with algal production. To examine such a possibility, we assessed the fungal community that developed on ceramic tiles that were fixed on opaque or clear pipes at three sites in the Natori River. The experiment showed that the periphytic chlorophyll a and the number of fungal species in the unshaded tiles were significantly greater than those in the shaded tiles. However, a nested structure was not detected between the fungal assemblages of the unshaded and shaded tiles. Instead, the taxon compositions largely differed between these tiles, which indicated most fungal species that colonized the shaded condition were replaced by others in the unshaded condition where algae grew. The results indicate that light facilitate the colonization and growth of several epilithic fungal species through the growth of sessile algae and suggest that not only the supply of autochthonous organic matter but also biological interactions play a pivotal role in shaping the epilithic fungal communities in lotic habitats.","Acknowledgments We are grateful to Satoshi Chiba, Takao Suzuki, and Wataru Makino as well as the two anonymous reviewers that helped to improve this manuscript.

Both Barbus species are of the large fluvio-lacustrine ecophenotype and thus they share habitats in the river. Mitochondrial (N = 35) and nuclear (N = 256) DNA sequences were completed with the aim of estimating the extent and genetic consequences of the B. barbus invasion. The phylogenetic analyses, based on cyt b mtDNA, S7 ribosomal protein and growth hormone (GH) nuclear genes, revealed 59 haplotypes as B. plebejus and 37 as B. barbus. Genetic diversity values (H and π) and the mismatch distribution analyses indicated B. plebejus was still experiencing demographic radiation from a modest number of founders. The B. barbus cyt b haplotypes suggested their original source was the River Danube. Through analysing the nuclear paralog sequences, evidence was provided of consistent genetic admixture between B. plebejus and B. barbus, being recorded in over 40% of the sampled fishes, indicating that their ecological and biological interactions are disrupting the genetic integrity of B. plebejus. Bayesian analysis and factorial correspondence analysis then revealed that the habitat fragmentation of the Adda River is not limiting population connectivity. It was apparent there has been recent and rapid upstream dispersion of B. barbus, with individuals overcoming barriers to their migration through using fish passes and/or through translocation between impounded sections by anglers. The potential conservation implications of this for the endemic Barbus species are discussed.","We thank Gaetano Gentili, Francesca Salmaso and the GRAIA srl team for the support in the sampling collection.

An ecological macroepibenthic survey was conducted in three ecoregions in the north-western Weddell Sea, on the continental shelf of the Antarctic Peninsula in the Bransfield Strait and on the shelf of the South Shetland Islands in the Drake Passage, defined by their environmental envelop. The aim was to improve the so far poor knowledge of the structure of this component of the Southern Ocean ecosystem and its ecological driving forces. It can also provide a baseline to assess the impact of ongoing climate change to the benthic diversity, functioning and ecosystem services. Different intermediate-scaled topographic features such as canyon systems including the corresponding topographically defined habitats ‘bank’, ‘upper slope’, ‘slope’ and ‘canyon/deep’ were sampled. In addition, the physical and biological environmental factors such as sea-ice cover, chlorophyll-a concentration, small-scale bottom topography and water masses were analysed. Catches by Agassiz trawl showed high among-station variability in biomass of 96 higher systematic groups including ecological key taxa. Large-scale patterns separating the three ecoregions from each other could be correlated with the two environmental factors, sea-ice and depth. Attribution to habitats only poorly explained benthic composition, and small-scale bottom topography did not explain such patterns at all. The large-scale factors, sea-ice and depth, might have caused large-scale differences in pelagic benthic coupling, whilst small-scale variability, also affecting larger scales, seemed to be predominantly driven by unknown physical drivers or biological interactions.","Thanks are due to the SCAR biology programme ‘Antarctic Thresholds—Ecosystem Resilience and Adaptation’(AnT-ERA) due to financial support of a post-expedition workshop held in Dijon, France, in 2014 and to the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft for financial support of project JA-1063/17-1.

Patella allowed barnacle settlement by preventing growth of competing green algae, but reduced post-settlement densities. Small clumps of Fucus spiralis L., F. vesiculosus L, and F. serratus L. all reduced settlement considerably more so than limpets. F. serratus had the greatest sweeping effect.Interactions between macroalgae and Semibalanus balanoides have been investigated at all levels on sheltered shores and low down on more exposed shores. In the Fucus spiralis and F. vesiculosus zones, post-settlement numbers were higher than in adjacent areas where the canopy was removed. Barnacles did not settle readily in the Ascophyllum zone in either experimental or control areas. Settlement occurred in the upper part of the Fucus serratus zone in experimental areas where the canopy was removed but not in control areas. No settlement occurred in either treatment or control areas lower in the F. serratus zone. At all levels on the shore fucoid canopies seemed to reduce cyprid settlement, but the effect was greatest amongst F. serratus where there was total prevention. High on the shore the effect of enhanced post-settlement survival under the canopy outweighs reduction of cyprid settlement thus there are greater numbers in the controls.

While previous research has focused on the physical and biological impacts of large-scale tidal restrictions, such as dikes and undersized culverts, the effect of smaller historic earthen barriers (average height = 0.71 m ± 0.12 SE; average length = 166 m ± 41 SE), or berms, is less understood. Here, we investigate how salt marsh plant communities respond to berms located in the interior of the marsh and oriented parallel to tidal rivers or creeks. Based on the observations from a descriptive study, the landward side of the berm consistently shows a distinct plant species assemblage from the reference areas (ANOSIM: R = 0.541, p = 0.001), which is most likely a result of landward pool development. A follow-up manipulative transplant experiment considers how the landward pools affect the governing factors (e.g., physical stress, competition, etc.) controlling the distribution and abundance of Schoenoplectus maritimus and Spartina patens in the landward and seaward zones. The experimental results show that while physical stress seems to prevent robust S. patens growth in the landward zone (ANOVA: F = 24.697; p < 0.001), herbivory seems to be the main driving factor behind the low S. maritimus cover found in the seaward zone (Mann–Whitney: U = 56, p = 0.015). The combined results from the two studies show that berm-associated pools have the potential to impact biological interactions within and across trophic levels in salt marshes.","We are grateful to Gregg Moore, Thomas Lee, Chris Peter, Alyson Eberhardt, and Chris Neefus for their guidance on study design and statistical analyses.

Carbon mineralisation rates, as based on sediment oxygen consumption rates, ranged from 54 to 89 g C m−2 y−1. The relatively high carbon mineralisation rates, large macrofaunal biomass (9 to 16 g C m−2) and macrofaunal production (11 to 19 g C m−2 y−1) provide evidence of high organic-matter input and intense benthic–pelagic coupling. This is further supported by the high dominance of the suspension-feeding bivalve Corbula gibba, which accounts for 52 to 63% of the total annual macrofaunal biomass production. Although the infaunal distribution of total macrofauna showed a sharp decline in densities and biomass with depth into the sediment, different patterns within the dominant taxa were observed. Whilst the bivalve Corbula gibba and the amphipod Ampelisca sp. were restricted to the surface layer, other species such as the dominant bivalve Mysella sp. and the gastropod Hyala sp. were not confined to a specific depth level and the majority of the populations occurred deeper than 5 cm into the sediment. Bioturbation, based on the occurrence of macrofauna, extended to at least 20 cm. Nematodes and foraminifera together formed 80 to 90% of the meiofaunal community in the upper 5 cm of the sediment. Annual mean densities ranged from 3.40 to 6.07×106 ind. m−2. Maximum abundance of meiofauna was not encountered at the station where maximum macrofaunal activity was recorded, and this could reflect the negative effect of biological interaction on meiofaunal densities in areas that have a high food supply.","Peter Herman is acknowledged for valuable discussions during the various phases of this study as are Karline Soetaert and Els Flach for critically reading the manuscript.

Short‐term field experiments (<2 months’ duration) were set up to quantify the effects of both grazing and pre‐emption on species replacement in the assemblage in three different seasons. An 8‐month field experiment was set up to quantify long‐term effects, including the indirect effects of both grazing and competitive dominance on the community structure. Results suggested that seasonal change in the algal assemblage resulted from the interaction of abiotic environmental change, competition and grazing. The relative contribution of these factors varied within a short period, presumably as a result of seasonal changes in physical environmental stress, free space availability and grazing pressure. From February to March, when grazer density was low and there was much free space available for algae, the dominant species shifted from foliose green alga Monostroma angicava to filamentous red alga Bangia atropurpurea, because B. atropurpurea grew faster than M. angicava. This species replacement was not influenced strongly by biological interaction but by temporal changes in abiotic environmental conditions. From April to mid May, when there was less free space available for algae in the natural community, the dominant B. atropurpurea decreased with increasing foliose red alga Porphyra yezoensis, because only P. yezoensis was able to invade an area pre‐empted by algae. Grazing did not affect this species replacement. After mid May, the two dominant species, P. yezoensis and B. atropurpurea, decreased. Their decline was mainly caused by desiccation stress and was partially affected by grazing.",,,Ecological Research,,Wiley,"0912-3814, 1440-1703",,2003-11,2003,2004-01-05,2003-11,18,6,695-709,Closed,Article,"Noda, Takashi; Minamiura, Noriko; Miyamoto, Yasushi","Noda, Takashi (); Minamiura, Noriko (Laboratory of Marine Biodiversity, Faculty of Fisheries, Hokkaido University, 3‐1‐1 Minato‐cho Hakodate 041‐8611, Japan); Miyamoto, Yasushi (Laboratory of Marine Biodiversity, Faculty of Fisheries, Hokkaido University, 3‐1‐1 Minato‐cho Hakodate 041‐8611, Japan)","Noda, Takashi ","Noda, Takashi (); Minamiura, Noriko (Hokkaido University); Miyamoto, Yasushi (Hokkaido University)",Hokkaido University,grid.39158.36,Sapporo,Hokkaidô,Japan,,,,,,8,0,,0.55,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1021856535,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,

Transects (n 43) were placed evenly along an altitudinal gradient at Finse, Hardangervidda, western Norway, from ridges to late snowbeds. These gradients were systematically sampled (Repeated Gradient Analysis, RGA) and an adjusted F-test was used to determine repeated trends in species distribution along the transects. Of the 41 taxa analysed 22 showed a significant change in expected occurrence in response to time of snowmelt (when a site becomes free of snow) as altitude increased. Three types of response were observed: (1) no change in response: (2) increased occurrence as altitude increases, i.e. the taxon invades snow-free sites as altitude increases, and (3) decreased occurrence as altitude increases, i.e. the taxon retreats from snow covered areas. It is suggested that the changes in response are due to both environmental factors (temperature related) and biological interactions. Decreases in expected occurrence are probably due to increased environmental severity as altitude increases (temperature related decreases). These species are represented by taxa preferring intermediate cover of snow. The invasion of earlier snow-free sites is probably due to reduced competition from lee-side taxa as altitude increases. A predictive model based on the species-environmental relationships suggests that a 1 K temperature increase changes the limits of occurrence in response to time of snowmelt from 3 to 20 days for the different taxa.

The unique coastal ecosystems of the mangrove belt along the coast of the Guianas in South America are influenced by cycles of a massive accretion of mud supplied by the Amazon River and wave induced erosion. This study characterized, for the first time, how benthic infaunal assemblages, as proxies of mechanisms of mangrove resilience, were structured by the natural growth track of Avicennia germinans dominated mangroves in French Guiana. We sampled 4 mobile mud stations and 27 consolidated mud stations distributed over 9 tidal transects from bare to vegetated mudflats colonized by young mangroves during the dry season. We collected a complete dataset of sediment and vegetation variables together with the benthic meso- (>0.25 mm) and macrofauna (>1 mm). We used a combination of eigenvector based multivariate analyses and variance partitioning on this multiple set of variables to identify which environmental variables likely drive the benthic diversity patterns. Mangrove early development increased the alpha and beta diversities of the infaunal communities for the two size classes. A total of 20–30% and 7–12% of the beta diversity are explained by linear and nonlinear spatial variables, respectively. However, 7% to 9% of the variance partioning could be determined by other biotic/abiotic variables, biological interactions or neutral processes, not described here. This study has highlighted the necessity of taking into account mangrove dynamics at suitable spatial scales for benthic biodiversity evaluation and mangrove management or restoration plans.",,,Sustainability,,MDPI,2071-1050,,2022-02-28,2022,2022-02-28,,14,5,2829,All OA; Gold,Article,"Michaud, Emma; Aschenbroich, Adélaïde; Gauthier, Olivier; Fromard, François; Aller, Josephine Y.; Aller, Robert C.; Brunier, Guillaume; Anthony, Edward J.; Gardel, Antoine; Le Garrec, Vincent; Leynaert, Aude; Thouzeau, Gérard","Michaud, Emma (); Aschenbroich, Adélaïde (); Gauthier, Olivier (); Fromard, François (); Aller, Josephine Y.

Understanding the patterns in phenotypic changes under multiple stressors is key to identify the principles in relationships between traits and phenotype–environment associations. In the present study, we examined the changes in fitness‐related parameters (somatic growth, fecundity, survival and population growth), and expression patterns of three phenotypic responses (hemoglobin production, enlargement of filter‐screen area and neck teeth formation) in the freshwater zooplankton Daphnia pulex, by rearing their individuals under factorial combinations of three environmental stressors (oxygen deficiency, food limitation and presence of kairomones released from Chaoborus spp.). Changes in the fitness parameters indicated the presence of trade‐offs with energy allocation between life‐history traits and phenotypic changes. The hemoglobin expression level was enhanced not only by low oxygen conditions but also by presence of the kairomones, however, it was reduced under low food conditions. Interactive effects of multiple stressors on morphological changes were also detected: the development level of neck teeth was reduced under low oxygen conditions, and the filter‐screen adaptation under low food conditions was also slightly suppressed by exposure to the kairomones. Various ecological situations can interactively determine the phenotypes, affecting population dynamics and consequent community structures through the modification of biological interactions. We evaluated effects of multiple stressors (oxygen deficiency, predator cue and resource limitation) on fitness parameters and phenotypic plasticity (hemoglobin synthesis, neck teeth formation and filter‐screen enlargement) in Daphnia pulex. Changes in fitness parameters (somatic growth, survival and fecundity) of D. pulex indicated the presence of trade‐offs between life‐history traits and phenotypic responses. Several limited or enhanced patterns in the phenotypic responses under combination of different stressors were found.",ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This study was supported by a JSPS KAKENHI grant for Scientific Research (C) to Masaki Sakamoto (Grant No. 17K00584).

Whether shallow backwater lakes in large river floodplains exhibit similar alternate stable states is less understood. This study considers mechanisms, interactions and feedbacks associated with a shift in environmental conditions and biotic community structure in backwater lakes of a hydrologically dynamic floodplain river system. We use long-term data from backwater lakes to show an increase in submersed aquatic vegetation, improved water quality, and resulting shifts in the community structure of aquatic vegetation and fish following a 4 year period of summer low water discharge on the Upper Mississippi River. Backwater lakes in our study span a gradient of environmental conditions. Backwater lakes located in the upper reach of our study area were chronically turbid and support only sparse aquatic macrophytes, whereas those downriver exhibited clearer water and abundant vegetation. An increase in submersed aquatic vegetation in the lower backwater lakes resulted in a fish community shift to more vegetation-associated species. A lesser response in submersed aquatic vegetation abundance and fish community shift was observed in the upper, more turbid backwater lakes. The combination of vegetative cover and turbidity were key environmental variables associated with fish community structure in lower backwater lakes. Turbidity was the key environmental variable associated with submersed aquatic vegetation in both upper and lower backwaters. Providing further insight into the physical, chemical and biological interactions associated with ecological shifts will help guide management and restoration decisions towards more resilient, macrophyte-rich floodplain backwaters.","This study was funded as part of the Upper Mississippi River Restoration Program, Long Term Resource Monitoring element; a cooperative effort between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Survey, and the states of Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, and Wisconsin.

This investigation was carried out with the purpose of estimating the variation of the metabolism and physicochemical variables in the lower basin of the Cesar River, during the period of maximum dry season, the trophic state of the lower basin of the aquatic ecosystem was determined by observations in the changes of the O2 consumption and CO2 accumulation, the processes of photosynthesis and respiration were quantified. Two samplings were carried out in four stations, between February-April 2013, equivalent to the dry period. Physicochemical variables in situ and some nutrients were measured. The metabolism protocol was applied, using the Winkler method (clear and dark bottles), with measurements every hour for 24 h (daily curve). The net metabolism was -10732.23 O2/m3-h, the dark one of -10731.41 02/m3-h and the gross primary production of the entire aquatic community of -10736.91 02/m3-h.

We have attempted, here, to place into perspective one interrelationship that could have important implications in the production and vigor of seagrasses. This is the relationship between epiphytic fouling by macroalgae and periphyton and the grazers which consume them as a food source while leaving the leaves intact. Our approach to this review was first to describe the relationships between macroalgae, periphyton and the seagrass host in terms of physical benefits, biochemical interactions, factors which reduce fouling on the host, and the effects of epiphytism on seagrass photosynthesis. We then examined the importance of epiphytes as a food source for those herbivores found in seagrass beds, and looked at the consequences of this grazing and removal of epiphytes for the seagrass host. Based on the potential impact of epiphytes on seagrass and grazers on epiphytes, we developed a hypothetical model that describes the effect of increasing epiphytic fouling on seagrass production in the presence and absence of grazers. From this model, we have made predictions on the direction of seagrass decline with diminishing light along depth and estuarine gradients. Lastly, we touched briefly on the problem of eutrophication and how it affects the balance of these interrelationships, and the management options to insure the health and survival of seagrass habitats in the face of increasing stress by man on these critically important ecosystems.",,,Aquatic Botany,,Elsevier,"0304-3770, 1879-1522",,1984-03,1984,,1984-03,18,1-2,43-69,Closed,Article,"Orth, Robert J.; Van Montfrans, Jacques","Orth, Robert J.

551,pub.1040664566,10.1016/j.jembe.2007.01.010,,,,Persistent regional variation in populations of a tidepool fish,"Understanding the factors that drive population dynamics is particularly challenging in systems that are connected via propagule dispersal because the rate of arrival of new individuals is both notoriously unpredictable and potentially critical in determining future dynamics. Furthermore, patterns of propagule recruitment can be fundamentally modified by post-recruitment interactions. We investigated how variation in both the recruitment of juveniles and local community structure affected the demography of an intertidal fish in two oceanographically distinct regions in Oregon. From 2001–2003, we observed persistently higher densities of adult tidepool fish Clinocottus globiceps (Girard) at Cape Foulweather, a stronger-upwelling region compared to Cape Perpetua, a weaker-upwelling region. In 2002, recruitment was roughly two times higher in the Cape Perpetua region. By the following spring, densities of adults were more than three times higher in the Cape Foulweather region, implicating intense post-recruitment mortality in the Cape Perpetua region as the cause of regional differences in adult densities. We manipulated, using a factorial experimental design, the presence and absence of dominant sessile organisms in tidepools at one site in each region in the spring of 2002 and explored whether differences in tidepool communities could be related to regional variation in fish abundance. Fish recruited disproportionately to pools with low cover of mussels in both regions. By the following spring, adults were more abundant in pools with mussels in one region and equally abundant in pools with or without mussels in the other region. Possible explanations for regional differences in C. globiceps populations include regional variation in the cover of intertidal invertebrates, in local biological interactions such as predation, or in coastal bathymetry that may be linked to variation in physical processes controlling recruitment and over-winter survival.","We thank the many interns, technicians, and graduate students who were always willing to lend a hand in the field.

Nine mesocosms were deployed in the Bay of Calvi (Corsica, France) in summer 2012. Six mesocosms were subjected to different levels of CO2 partial pressures (pCO2; 550, 650, 750, 850, 1000 and 1250 μatm) covering the range of atmospheric pCO2 anticipated for the end of this century depending on future emission scenarios, and the last three mesocosms were unaltered (ambient pCO2 of ∼450 μatm). During this 21-day experiment, we monitored copepod egg and naupliar stocks, estimated copepod (Acartia clausi and Centropages typicus) feeding rates and determined the abundance and taxonomic composition of the mesozooplankton community at the start and at the completion of the experiment. This community was clearly dominated by copepods and its final composition slightly varied between mesocosms most likely due to natural and experimental variability that cannot be related to CO2 conditions. The abundances of eggs and nauplii as well as feeding rates of A. clausi and C. typicus on diatoms, dinoflagellates and ciliates showed no significant differences among CO2 levels. The above findings suggest that the experimental set-up especially for the specific trophic conditions and the short duration of the experiment did not provide the information on the effect of acidification that was expected. The acidification might have an effect on planktonic communities and even worsen the problems imposed by food limitation, therefore on this short time scale experiment and under the extreme ologotrophic conditions the signal that dominates was the food limitation.","This work was funded by the EC FP7 project ‘Mediterranean Sea Acidification in a changing climate’ (MedSeA; grant agreement 265103), the project European Free Ocean Carbon Enrichment (eFOCE; BNP-Paribas foundation), the MISTRALS-MERMEX program (Institut des Sciences de l’Univers, INSU), the Corsican local authorities and the Rhone-Mediterranean and Corsica Water Agency (http://www.eaurmc.fr).

A broader perspective that considers multiple components of food webs is necessary to understand natural systems. In particular, consumer diversity needs to be more thoroughly examined as trophic interactions and indirect effects can alter ecosystem properties. We test the potential for consumer diversity (fish richness and composition) to govern food web dynamics at two levels of environmental complexity (mesocosms and experimental ponds) and explore the consequences of removing individual species of fish on lower trophic levels. In mesocosms, both the richness and density of zooplankton were reduced when more fish species were present. No effects from the fish treatments were found on phytoplankton, but phosphorus levels increased with higher fish richness. Removing either generalist or specialist fish species increased the richness and density of zooplankton and the amount of phytoplankton, whereas all fish species had redundant effects on nutrients. In ponds, a dominant fish species (specialist shiner) determined the richness and density of zooplankton. In contrast, phytoplankton and nutrients were reduced by higher fish richness in the fall and spring. Overall, the specialist shiner had unique effects on the pond food web suggesting the key to understanding function is the presence of a dominant species and their biological interactions. Differences between mesocosms and ponds are likely due to increased heterogeneity of resources in the ponds allowing species to specialize on different prey. Our study links the biodiversity ecosystem function paradigm with food web concepts to improve predictions for conservation and management actions in response to changes in biodiversity.","We thank the staff at the Kaskaskia and Sam Parr Biological Stations, Illinois Natural History Survey, especially K.

Climate indices associated with oceanographic processes, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation in the North Pacific, and the Arctic Oscillation in the Arctic, were strongly correlated with macrobenthic density and taxon richness, indicating inadequacies of inferences concerning biodiversity from short-term studies as shifts in benthic assemblages are possible when influenced by climate-driven changes in water circulation. Species accumulation curves demonstrate that less than 50 % of biodiversity information may be captured in an area within two years, independent of sampling scale, with 90 % captured in 17 years. Additionally, assumptions of water temperature as a limiting factor for benthic organisms may not hold in Alaska as many organisms are widely dispersed across temperature regimes and, instead, some species may be limited by regional-scale biological interactions. Thus, species-specific investigations of life history and environmental tolerances together with long-term data sets are needed to predict future climate-driven responses to better conserve and manage resources. The two study areas share 33 % of species in common as a result of oceanographic linkages indicating that past geological history is as important as current oceanographic conditions for our understanding of the present. Better availability and retrospective analyses of historic data will contribute to a greater understanding of macroscale ecological patterns. The study also demonstrates the importance of considering broader studies in management decisions, like the long-term Port Valdez study, that can inform decision processes for research in Arctic seas.","The Port Valdez Environmental Studies Program was funded by Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.

It is difficult to forecast how climate change will influence community function or the probability of invasion as it alters multiple marine environmental parameters including rising water temperature, lower salinity and pH. In the present study, we correlate changes in environmental parameters to shifts in species composition in a subtidal community in Newcastle, NH through comparison of two, 3‐year periods separated by 23 years (1979–1981 and 2003–2005). We observed concurrent shifts in climate related factors and in groups of organisms that dominate the marine community when comparing 1979–1981 to 2003–2005. The 1979–1981 community was dominated by perennial species (mussels and barnacles). In contrast, the 2003–2005 community was dominated by annual native and invasive tunicates (sea‐squirts). We also observed a shift in the environmental factors that characterized both communities. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate characterized the 1979–1981 community while sea surface temperature, pH, and chlorophyll a characterized the 2003–2005 community. Elongated warmer water temperatures, through the fall and early winter months of the 2000s, extended the growing season of native organisms and facilitated local dominance of invasive species. Additionally, beta‐diversity was greater between 2003–2005 than 1979–1981 and driven by larger numbers of annual species whose life‐history characteristics (e.g., timing and magnitude of recruitment, growth and mortality) are driven by environmental parameters, particularly temperature.","Field assistance was provided by L.

This study analyzed the community structure of rotifers and their secondary production in two lakes of an Upper Paraná River floodplain (Brazil) differing in their hydrology: one connected to the river and the other isolated. Integrated samples of the water column were collected daily during 15 days in the low and high water periods. Three statistical methods, ANOVA, MRT, and IndVal were applied to distinguish the structure, biomass, and secondary production of their rotifer communities. The rotifer fauna was rich (91 species). Temperature, an indicator of seasonal change, and hydrological connection to river were major factors structuring rotifer communities. The community presented differences between periods in the isolated lake, but had a higher stability in the connected lake. We identified 34 indicator species of the groups formed by the MRT analysis. Production was low and consistent in the connected lake (∼1.5 µg DW m−3 day−1), being higher and more variable in the isolated lake (peaking at ca. 60–90 µg DW m−3 day−1). Results also showed that changing environmental conditions verified in the low water period and in the isolated lake were determinant for both the community structure and the secondary production of rotifers. We demonstrate that not only flooding but also the levels of isolation from the river during low water period are the driving forces for the structure and dynamics of organisms in floodplains. Thus, the isolated lakes represent important areas for rotifer biodiversity.","Acknowledgments The authors thank to PELD (site 6)/CNPq provided financial support and CNPq provided doctoral (J.D.D.) and Research Productivity scholarships (C.C.B.).

To examine the potential roles of habitat and food availability, we compared spatial data on distribution and abundance from aerial surveys undertaken during the seasonal transition into early summer, with corresponding data for river discharge and salmon abundance. Principal component regression indicated strong relationships with rates of river discharge that explained over 90 % of the inter-annual variability of beluga abundances recorded in the Susitna Delta. Belugas moved away from the Susitna Delta when flow rate from the Susitna River was low relative to rivers draining into the Knik Arm and Turnagain Arm. Using only three principal components describing shape, river discharge during May explained 86 % of the inter-annual variability in abundances recorded in the Susitna Delta. In years of reduced abundance in the Susitna Delta, movement was toward the Knik Arm until 2003, transitioning thereafter to the Turnagain Arm including Chickaloon Bay. In contrast, escapements of Chinook salmon in the Deshka River (a tributary of the Susitna River) showed an inverse relationship with beluga abundance in the Susitna Delta, suggesting that escapements were dependent on beluga abundance. These results demonstrated the influence of highly dynamic habitat availability on the distribution of belugas and the importance of the physical environment in structuring the activity of higher predators on prey species.","The study was supported by the Kenai Peninsula Borough, award No. KPB 271.21135.90216.43011, NOAA Fisheries Alaska Region, contract No. HA133F10SE3655 and NOAA Climate Programs, Award No. NA08OAR4310613.

551,pub.1129776574,10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106741,,,,Using realized thermal niche to validate thermal preferences from laboratory studies. How do they stand?,"Temperature is recongnised as the main factor controlling the species fitness and performance. Naturally, the thermal preferences (TP) of aquatic organisms obtained in controlled conditions have been used to relate physiological performance with field data since they are a good proxy to the fundamental niche. Literature suggests that dispersal capabilities, biological interactions, acclimatisation, adaptation, among others might play a role in species distribution; thus, in reality, species are usually occupying a realized thermal niche (RTN). Therefore, this study was designed to inquire into the following questions: Are the TP of tropical aquatic ectotherms found in laboratory conditions similar to their RTN? Can TP be validated with occurrences in the wild? To answer these questions, this study compared the TP obtained from previously published works with the RTN of the crabs Callinectes similis and C. sapidus, the fishes Centropomus undecimalis and Ocyurus chrysurus, the lobster Panulirus argus, and the octopus Octopus maya obtained from occurrences from 1693documents. When RTN values were tested against the TPs obtained in laboratory, no significant differences were found for fish species (P > 0.05); in contrast, differences for the benthic invertebrates were reported (P < 0.05). At least two factors could have been affecting these results: differences in the average tolerances between geographically distinct populations (local adaptation) and the dispersal capabilities that might have been forcing a differentiation between populations If, as proposed, fishes can actively follow thermal optimum, their response to warming scenarios could be faster than benthic organisms. If our hypothesis is true, the uncertainty of climate change could be reduced when the local adaptation is taking into consideration.","This study is the result of a Graduate Studies doctoral degree thesis at Ciencias del Mar y Limnología, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM); the authors are grateful to UNAM and to the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONACYT) for the scholarship funding the development of this research.

Here the term 'purification' is defined, in a wide sense, as a potential role of the lakecontributing to reduction of pollutants and thus restraint to eutrophication; in which various processes concerning seasonal nutrient fixation such as uptake by aquatic plants, attachment to foliage substrates and feeding by organisms of higher-trophic level are regarded as biological purification processes together with eternal losses or removals from waters. In order to evaluate thepurification capacity, a numerical lake ecosystem model was developed highlighting on the roleof macrophyte colonies that inhabit alongshore, and applied to Lakes Suwa, Kasumi, Biwa andfive attached sublakes of Lake Biwa.The model takes account of the biological interactions between pelagic compartments (phytoandzooplankton, detritus, dissolved organic matter, pelagic fish and nutrients) and benthic compartments (macrophytes, attached algae, attached small animals, macro- and megalobenthos anddemersal fish). Under the time-dependent conditions of meteorological and hydraulic factors, themodel was run over a year to evaluate annual nutrient budget and purification capacity of eachlake. The results revealed that the purification capacity is generally estimated, from the standpoints of both stock and flux, higherin the shoreregion than in the offshoreregion becauseof awide variety of organisms including aquatic plants. Moreover,it almost increases in proportion tovegetation densityof the shoreregion.Nutrientfluxes associatedwith purificationprocessesturnedout closely related to surfacearea or equivalently to retentiontime of lake waters,suggestingthatthe biological purificationdoes not becomedominantagainst physical turnoveruntil the surfacearea reaches around 103 ha or the retention time exceeds around 10^2 days.",,,海洋理工学会誌,,,1341-2752,,2019-02,2019,,,7,1+2,31-52,Closed,Article,"浩一, 田口; 喜三郎, 中田; 日出春, 田森","浩一, 田口 (株式会社シーティーアイ); 喜三郎, 中田 (東海大学海洋学部); 日出春, 田森 (社団法人日本水産資源保護協会)",,"浩一, 田口 (); 喜三郎, 中田 (Tokai University); 日出春, 田森 ()",Tokai University,grid.265061.6,Tokyo,Tôkyô,Japan,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1116340501,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 37 Earth Sciences,,Generic health relevance,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,14 Life Below Water

I experimentally tested for higher order interactions in a freshwater food web by independently manipulating the presence and absence of two predators (the salamander Notophthalmus viridescens and the crayfish Cambarus bartonii) and their tadpole prey (Hyla chrysoscelis) in a series of artificial ponds. By destructively sampling selected ponds early in the larval period (days 5 and 6), I hoped to predict whether the predators would have an interactive effect on tadpole survival and growth on day 30. Early destructive samples adequately predicted subsequent influences of interactions on the survival, but not on the size of Hyla. Early samples predicted that the predators would interact to determine tadpole survival and size. The two predators did not act additively to determine tadpole abundance: more survived in the presence of both predators than was predicted. This higher order interaction was most likely caused by physical interference between the predators and predator avoidance by the tadpoles. Early samples correctly predicted higher order interactions would be seen on tadpole growth, but completely failed to predict their direction because the biological interactions changed over time. Early in their larval period, tadpoles behaviorally avoided predators, which caused slower growth, but later, tadpoles in predator treatments grew faster due to diminished intraspecific competition. These results suggest that higher order interactions may be important in nature. Short—term experiments may prove useful in predicting when higher order interactions will occur, but detailed models may be required to predict their outcome accurately.",,,Ecology,,Wiley,"0012-9658, 1939-9170",,1990-08-01,1990,1990-08-01,1990-08,71,4,1609-1616,Closed,Article,"Fauth, John E.","Fauth, John E.

Among many individual and environmental aspects affecting mortality during the early life-stages of fish, encountering food at greater than average concentrations is regarded important for survival. Intense aggregations of zooplankton in near-surface waters provide these conditions for larval fish. Simulation studies by individual-based modeling can help understanding of the mechanisms for survival during early life-stages. In this study, we examined how growth and survival of larvae and early juveniles of Lesser Sandeel (Ammodytes marinus) in the North Sea are influenced by availability and patchiness of the planktonic prey by adapting and applying a generic bioenergetic individual-based model for larval fish. Input food conditions were generated by modeling copepod size spectra dynamics and patchiness based on particle count transects and Continuous Plankton Recorder time series data. The study analyzes the effects of larval hatching time, presence of zooplankton patchiness and within patch abundance on growth and survival of sandeel early life-stages in the North Sea. Simulations of patchiness related starvation mortality are able to explain observed patterns of variation in sandeel growth. Reduced prey densities within patches decrease growth and survival rate of larvae and match–mismatch affect growth and survival of larvae with different hatch time due to plankton seasonality. Of general scientific and environmental management interest, the results indicate a steep threshold concentration critical for survival at around 0.04–0.05 no. zooplankton/mL.","This study is funded by the grants from the Directorate for Food, Fisheries and Agri Business: Modelling the Impact of Hydrography and Lower Trophic Production on Fish Recruitment (MODREC, Contract no. 3304-FVFP-060683) and the Danish Strategic Research Council: Sustainable fisheries, climate change and the North Sea ecosystem (SUNFISH, Contract no. 2101-07-0080).

A large-scale field experiment was conducted to investigate effects of eliminating the polychaete Arenicola marina on benthic microbes (prokaryotes, heterotrophic and autotrophic protists) and metazoan meiofauna in a marine intertidal flat of the North Sea, Germany. Over a period of 2 years, quantity and composition of micro- and meiobenthos from unmanipulated sites were compared to those from sites deplete of lugworms. These grazer treatments were cross-classified with different sediment characteristics (low- and mid-intertidal areas). Lugworm removal resulted in an initial increase in abundance of prokaryotes and nanoflagellates, which became less pronounced in the second year. Ciliates were not affected quantitatively, but in the absence of lugworms, diversity and the proportion of carnivorous forms increased. Meiobenthos (nematodes, ostracods and copepods) were affected only moderately. The observed changes are probably due to a combination of release from grazing/predation pressure, changes in the species composition of higher trophic levels (namely large polychaetes) and altered environmental conditions (such as depth of the oxygenated layer and sediment grain size). Spatial differences between sites of different tidal exposure/grain size appeared to be as large as temporal differences during the 2 years following the manipulation of the system. We conclude that in intertidal sediments, indirect effects due to habitat transformation are as important as direct biological interactions (grazing pressure and competition) for the dynamics of the benthic microbial food web.","This work received financial support from the Knowledge Innovation Program of CAS (KZCX2-YW-417), the German Research Community (DFG BE 2279/3-1), the National Science Foundation of China (40706047 and 40576072) and the `100 Talents Project’ of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Steps to formulating statistical models on the dynamics of populations and assemblages are discussed. Current models are mostly conceptual (~70% of studies surveyed), falling into 2 main classes: population dynamics (including recruitment, mortality, dispersal and availability of patches) and process‐orientated studies (including the response of individuals to the physical environment, biogenic habitat modification, biological interactions and physical perturbations). Most recent studies were descriptive or on the population dynamics of species and were undertaken mostly at spatial scales of up to 1 km and temporal scales of months. The development of statistical models appears to be impeded by the limited scope of studies, an over‐emphasis on conceptual models (but recognizing an important role for a rigorous experiment framework) and a difficulty in using outcomes from small‐scale processes at the level of individual organisms to predict larger scale outcomes where many interactions contribute to variation in abundances. Currently, few studies undertake field assessments of the defining characteristics of habitats, the dynamics of those habitats and the relative importance of different habitats to individual populations. Much urgent work is required to develop large scale (space: > 1 km; time: > 1 years) statistical models. This is because attention needs to be given to those interactions and processes in the ecological systems that will provide for the greatest reduction in uncertainty in the quantitative predictions derived from these models.",,,Australian Journal of Ecology,,Wiley,"0307-692X, 1442-9993",,1999-08,1999,2009-08-12,1999-08,24,4,452-476,Closed,Article,"Constable, Andrew J.","Constable, Andrew J.

Samples were taken monthly from August 2006 to July 2007. The well-defined climatic seasons were reflected in variations of the physical and chemical properties of the water. The zooplankton community consisted mainly of Rotifera, Cladocera and Copepoda, with occasional representatives of Chaoborus brasiliensis (Diptera), Ostracoda, Protozoa and Turbellaria. Rotifera was the dominant group in zooplankton community in 5 of the 12 months of the study and were represented by 35 taxa. Redundancy analysis between the rotifer population abundances and the set of environmental variables showed significant (p < 0.05) positive correlations with the chlorophyll a in the rainy season. In the dry period, predation was probably the environmental factor that had the strongest effect on rotifer populations; in particular, the density of the cyclopoid Thermocyclops decipiens showed significant (p < 0.05) negative correlations with many of the rotifer population abundances. In addition, analysis of the co-occurrence of different rotifer species indicated strong competitive interactions between populations, during the rainy period (p < 0.001). Among the biotic environmental factors analyzed, algal biomass had an important role during the rainy period and inter-rotifer competition was also significant in these months. It was probably that predation by the cyclopoid copepod Thermocyclops decipiens determined the structure and dynamics of the rotifer populations in the Sapucaí arm of the Furnas reservoir, during the dry period.",,,Biota Neotropica,,FapUNIFESP (SciELO),"1676-0603, 1676-0611",,2010-12,2010,2011-07-29,2010-12,10,4,173-182,All OA; Gold,Article,"Negreiros, Natalia Felix; dos Santos-Wisniewski, Maria José; dos Santos, Renata Martins; Rocha, Odete","Negreiros, Natalia Felix (São Carlos, São Paulo, Universidade Federal de São Carlos, Brazil); dos Santos-Wisniewski, Maria José (Alfenas, Minas Gerais, Universidade Federal de Alfenas, Department of Biology, Brazil); dos Santos, Renata Martins (São Carlos, São Paulo, Universidade Federal de São Carlos, Brazil); Rocha, Odete (São Carlos, São Paulo, Universidade Federal de São Carlos, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Brazil)",,"Negreiros, Natalia Felix (Federal University of São Carlos); dos Santos-Wisniewski, Maria José (Federal University of Alfenas); dos Santos, Renata Martins (Federal University of São Carlos); Rocha, Odete (Federal University of São Carlos)",Federal University of Alfenas; Federal University of São Carlos,grid.411180.d; grid.411247.5,Alfenas; São Carlos,; ,Brazil; Brazil,,,,,,7,2,,0.63,,http://www.scielo.br/pdf/bn/v10n4/23.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1008097237,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,
551,pub.1149143821,10.1111/oik.08890,,,,Marine gastropods at higher trophic level show stronger tolerance to ocean acidification,"Climate change and anthropogenic activities are producing a range of new selection pressures, both abiotic and biotic, on marine organisms. Although it is known that climate change can differentially affect fitness‐related traits at different trophic levels of the food web, it is not clear if different trophic levels will respond via phenotypic plasticity in the form of maintenance of phenotypes in the face of abiotic and biotic environmental stress similarly. To answer this question, we combined a mesocosm experiment (120 days) using a food web comprising three gastropod species from two trophic levels (grazers and meso‐predators) and a meta‐analysis including 38 studies to address whether different trophic levels exhibit similar phenotypic responses to abiotic and biotic variables. Abiotic (ocean acidification) and biotic (predation) stress significantly influenced body mass, shell mass, shell thickness and shell strength in both grazers and meso‐predators in the mesocosm experiment, with the magnitude of OA effects greater on the meso‐predator than the grazers; a result supported by the meta‐analysis. In contrast, both mesocosm experiment and meta‐analysis found that predation risk induced stronger responses in shell morphology for grazers compared to meso‐predators. Together, our findings indicate that higher trophic level species are better able to maintain aspects of their phenotype under OA, suggesting that they may show greater tolerance to climate change effects in general, while lower trophic levels express higher levels of plastic inducible defences to maintain function when under threat of predation. By using marine snails as a model, our study provides new knowledge for understanding how changing environmental conditions may alter biological interactions, and increases our understanding of how climate change may affect ecological communities in which gastropods play a key role.",Acknowledgments – We thank the China Scholarship Council (CSC) for supporting PhD studies for Nan Hu.

551,pub.1137605759,10.1111/1440-1703.12230,,,,Ecosystem engineering structures facilitate ecological resilience: A coral reef model,"Ecosystem engineers are organisms that affect ecosystem state by modifying the physical habitats in which biological interactions occur. Such engineering effect depends on both the engineers for environmental transformation and the persistency of engineered structures, but the distinction has rarely been considered. Here, we examined their relative effect on ecosystem in terms of ecological resilience. We used a mathematical model of a coral reef that incorporates reciprocal facilitation between corals and herbivores. Coral skeletons create physical habitats and promote habitat complexity, allowing more herbivore grazing on macroalgae, which opens further space for coral colonization. By quantifying resilience in form of its basin of attraction, we found that resilience declined much rapidly with the loss of habitat complexity (engineered structures) than from the loss of either corals (engineers) or herbivores, under the substantial pressures of fishing and eutrophication. This model outcome is in accordance with observed empirical patterns. It arises due to two characteristics of habitat complexity: slow temporal changes and habitat provisioning. Habitat complexity can persist even when corals are lost, facilitating the recovery of herbivores and, in turn, of corals. Our model suggests that, as the persistency of engineered structures increases, their influence on ecosystem dynamics increases and becomes independent from that of ecosystem engineer. Identifying such a distinction and its context are vital to preserving ecosystem resilience and to better avoid catastrophic shifts. Our coral reef model shows that ecological resilience could be more susceptible to the loss of habitat complexity than to that of ecosystem engineers. A general implication across ecosystems is that such influence of engineered structures on ecosystem dynamics would increase with their structural persistency and the strength of their interaction with biota.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Mr Chun‐Wei Chang and Dr Vianney Denis for their valuable suggestions on the earlier versions of the manuscript.

We considered great apes (Gorilla gorilla gorilla and Pan troglodytes troglodytes) as model species, and we used nest surveys, dietary analysis and botanical inventories to evaluate whether the traditional methods that use abundance data alone were consistent with the survival of the species. We assumed that setting a local priority area for animal conservation can be made possible if at least one variable (abundance or habitat variables) is spatially clustered and that the final decision for a species may depend on the pattern of spatial association between abundance, nesting habitat and feeding habitat. We used Kernel Density Estimation to evaluate the spatial pattern of each biological variable. The results indicate that all three variables were spatially clustered for both gorillas and chimpanzees. The abundance variables of both animal species were spatially correlated to their preferred nesting habitat variables. But while the chimpanzee feeding habitat variable was spatially correlated to the abundance and nesting habitat variables, the same pattern was not observed for gorillas. We then proposed different methods to be considered to design local priority areas for the conservation of each great ape species. Alone, the abundance variable does not successfully represent the spatial distribution of major biological requirements for the survival of wildlife species; we, therefore, recommend the integration of the spatial distribution of their food resources to overcome the mismatch caused by the existence of a biological interaction between congeneric species.","This research was supported financially by a research grant offered by the Conservation Action Research Network (CARN) to LRDT through the Congo Basin Grant Program, and by the Centre for Research and Conservation (CRC) of the Royal Zoological Society of Antwerp (RZSA) through its continued support of PGS activities.

Most studies have focused on the effect of large invasive fishes such as salmonids, whereas the effect of smaller fish on amphibians has been seldom investigated. We experimentally studied effects of the invasive Eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) on pygmy newts (Triturus pygmaeus), a species endemic to the Iberian Peninsula. We set up outdoor mesocosms in Doñana National Park with native aquatic flora and invertebrate fauna, and containing larval newts at two experimental densities. Density of larval newts was also crossed with presence or absence of mosquitofish, either free-swimming or caged, in order to distinguish consumptive and non-consumptive effects. Increased density of coexisting larval newts did not reduce their survival, but reduced their growth and development. Newt survival and size at metamorphosis were dramatically reduced in the presence of free-swimming mosquitofish, whether at low or high fish densities. Caged mosquitofish, however, had no effect on larval newts. In laboratory trials, mosquitofish preyed more efficiently on insect larvae than did larval pygmy newts, highlighting the high competitive potential of mosquitofish. This was confirmed by the depletion of zooplankton that free fish caused in the experimental outdoor mesocosms. Our study suggests that invasive mosquitofish exert a high negative impact on coexisting newt populations. Such effects can be explained by a combination of direct predation, injuries caused by predation attempts, and intense competitive exploitation of common food resources.","We thank Lola Asencio, Rosa Arribas, Pablo Burraco, Rafael Carmona, Sara Castro, Carmen Fernández, Pilar Fernández, Ana Herrero, María León, Raquel López and Daniel Moen for help in the field or in the laboratory.

Their properties include composition, structure, habitat, distribution, biological interactions and ecosystem functions. The community concept has a central role in conservation planning, and is a key approach for biodiversity conservation above the species level. The relatively recent application of risk assessment and regulatory systems to conservation of ecological communities has highlighted a number of challenges related to intrinsic uncertainties in the definition, diagnosis and assessment of ecological communities. In this review, I aim to elucidate some key conceptual issues essential to the interpretation of communities. Effective description, diagnosis and assessment of communities rests on an understanding of community theory in relation to environmental gradients and ecosystem dynamics. Continuum and discrete models can both contribute to interpretation of communities for conservation. Different sources of uncertainty are inherent in the key properties that characterize communities. Although some of these are reducible, remaining uncertainty must be incorporated into assessments and decision‐making processes for conservation. Protocols for assessing extinction risks of communities address rates of decline in distribution, size of distribution and rates of decline in ecological functions. Some protocols assess these factors in a manner that may be inconsistent with equivalent methods for assessing species. Communities may be viewed in a framework that distinguishes thematic, spatial and temporal scales. These scales influence the outcomes of risk assessment, the benefits and limitations of maps and how well communities perform their function in conservation planning. When applied effectively, ecological communities can be powerful tools for delivering cost‐effective outcomes for land‐use planning and biodiversity conservation.","This paper is based on invited plenaries presented at the Banded Ironstone Formation forum (Perth 2007), the Threatened Species Conservation Symposium (Sydney 2007) and workshops on vegetation mapping (Perth 2008) and Red List criteria for threatened ecosystems (London 2008).

Nevertheless, density-dependent factors also can drive population dynamics. In this paper, we analyzed thirteen years of a relative abundance index of two clupeoids fish populations coexisting in the central-south area off Chile, namely the common sardine, Strangomera bentincki, and anchovy, Engraulis ringens. We applied the classical diagnostic tools of time series analysis to the observed time-series. Also, the realized per capita population growth rate was studied with the aim of detecting the feedback structure that is characterizing the population dynamics of the two species. The analysis suggests that population fluctuations of the two species have an important density-dependent component, displaying first-order (direct density-dependent) and second-order (delayed density-dependent) simultaneously. The density-dependent component explained 70.5 and 55.6 % of the realized per capita population growth rate of common sardine and anchovy, respectively. The deterministic skeleton model showed an asymptotic convergence to equilibrium density. In presence of a stochastic environment, fluctuations were reproduced for the species showing a component of fluctuation with a period of 4 year. The intrinsic dynamics of each species is typical of interacting species resulting from trophic interactions. It is postulated that the second-order dynamics of S. bentincki and E. ringens in central-south Chile, may be the result from interactions with a specialist predator (the fishing fleet), interacting with exogenous environmental factors.","We thanks to Aquíles Sepulveda of the “Instituto de Investigación Pesquera”, by facilitate the database to compute the relative abundance index data used in our analyses.

551,pub.1042196155,10.1071/mf9890079,,,,Variation in the components of Benthic community structure in a Coastal Lagoon as a function of Spatial Scale,"The perception of community structure is strongly related to the spatial resolution of data collection. To quantify variation in community structure at several spatial scales, the benthos was examined on the limestone substratum in a nearshore coastal lagoon. Community structure was described using a form of pattern analysis called correspondence analysis. Variance at three spatial scales was measured. These scales were described as: (I) between offshore and nearshore reefs (kilometres); (2) among areas on the nearshore reef-line (< 1 km); and (3) between community types on the nearshore reef-line (tens of metres and less). Organisms were classified according to higher taxa/functional classes. Parameters which varied between reef-lines included: (i) community composition determined using multivariate ordination, (ii) cover by calcareous and filamentous algae and (iii) abundance of seagrass and juvenile kelp (Ecklonia radiata). Among the areas on the nearshore reef-line, variance in community composition was due to the distribution of animals. There was a south to north gradient of increasing cover by encrusting animals and abundance of ascidians. Within the areas on the nearshore reef-line, there were two distinct community types characterized by macrophytic plants or sessile invertebrates. The major potential controls of the variation in benthic community structure were different at each of the spatial scales examined. The strong relationships between extrinsic factors and components of the communities suggested that the major potential controls were: (a) exposure to swell at the large scale (between reef-lines), (b) availability of food at the medium scale (within areas on the nearshore reef-line) and (c) biological interactions or responses to microtopography and light climate at the small scale (between and within communities on the nearshore reef-line).",,,Marine and Freshwater Research,,CSIRO Publishing,"1323-1650, 0067-1940, 1448-6059",,1989-02-01,1989,1989-02-01,1989,40,1,79-96,Closed,Article,"Hatcher, A","Hatcher, A ()",,"Hatcher, A ()",,,,,,,,,,,23,0,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1042196155,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,

The present study envisages temporal variations of bycatch with regard to the species and their biological interactions based on data obtained from commercial single-day bottom trawlers operating off Goa, west coast of India. The data revealed that bycatch constituted about 68% of the trawl catch, the remaining being target species (shrimp, flat fishes, sciaenids, squids and crabs). Approximately 89% of the species discarded into the sea comprised of juveniles of target and trash species, suggesting a major share of non-target species, leading to species loss. Out of 196 taxa observed in the trawl catch, 174 constituted bycatch with a significantly high percentage of biomass. Abundance of discarded bycatch species (crustaceans, echinoderms, teleosts) displayed distinct peaks during pre-monsoon whereas molluscs, crustaceans and teleosts dominated during post-monsoon. A conspicuous increase in abundance of molluscs during post-monsoon (October, 2012) and echinoderms during pre-monsoon (April, 2011 and April, 2013) is largely attributed to the recruitment process. Cluster analysis identified different clusters during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon season corresponding to their recruitment patterns and diverse species assemblages. Principal Component Analysis performed using three environmental parameters accounted for 84% (five components) and 86% (four components) of variance during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon, respectively. Regression analysis indicated a significant linear relationship between total catch and bycatch (R2=0.89), and between bycatch and discarded catch (R2=0.94).","The first author is grateful to Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, New Delhi for a fellowship supporting the Ph.D. programme CSIR grant no. 09/409(0023)/2011-EMR-1.

551,pub.1025170728,10.2307/1940438,,,,Settlement Cues and Determination of the Vertical Limit of an Intertidal Barnacle,"The settlement behavior of the barnacle Chthamalus anisopoma near its upper intertidal limit was investigated using field surveys and experiments. The upper limit of Chthamalus was found to be extremely variable, ranging from 1.5 to 2.6 m above MLW. Chthamalus showed increased settlement in response to chemical cues produced by several species whose vertical distributions overlapped with its vertical distribution. Within a single species there was significantly more settlement in response to cues associated with Nertia funiculata that occurred with Chthamalus than to N. funiculata that occurred only above the vertical limit of Chthamalus. Another species that induced settlement, Acanthina angelica, is the major predator of adult Chthamalus. Acanthina may be a good settlement cue because it is a reliable indicator of the vertical distribution of Chthamalus and because (1) the clusters of Acanthina that induced settlement may move away before the new barnacles become edible; and (2) Chthamalus can develop a predator—resistant morphology in responses to Acanthina. I was also able to induce Chthamalus recruitment into areas well above their normal upper limits using a conspecific extract, indicating that conspecifics function as a strong settlement cue. The evolution of larval attraction to settlement cues should be dependent on the reliability of the cues and the consequences of not using them. Reliable cues and harsh consequences should lead to the development of ""strong"" (i.e., attractive) cues. However, reliable cues may be conservative; their absence may not indicate a ""bad"" settlement site. Therefore, a variable distribution of strong settlement cues could lead to temporal and spatial variability in a species regardless of other factors such as pre— and postsettlement physical conditions or biological interactions.",,,Ecology,,Wiley,"0012-9658, 1939-9170",,1988-04-01,1988,1988-04-01,1988-04,69,2,400-407,Closed,Article,"Raimondi, Peter T.","Raimondi, Peter T.

551,pub.1014891230,10.4141/p03-159,,,,Managing arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in cropping systems,"Market globalization, demographic pressure, and environmental degradation have led us to reconsider many of our current agricultural systems. The heavy use of chemical inputs, including fertilizers and pesticides, has resulted in pollution, decreased biodiversity in intensively-farmed regions, degradation of fragile agro-ecosystems, and prohibitive costs for many farmers. Low input sustainable cropping systems should replace conventional agriculture, but this requires a more comprehensive understanding of the biological interactions within agro-ecosystems. Mycorrhizal fungi appear to be the most important telluric organisms to consider. Mycorrhizae, which result from a symbiosis between these fungi and plant roots, are directly involved in plant mineral nutrition, the control of plant pathogens, and drought tolerance. Most horticultural and crop plants are symbiotic with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Mycorrhizal literature is abundant, showing that stimulation of plant growth can be mainly attributed to improved phosphorous nutrition. Although the mycorrhizal potential of its symbiosis to improve crop production is widely recognized, it is not implemented in agricultural systems. There is an urgent need to improve and widely apply analytical methods to evaluate characteristics such as, relative field mycorrhizal dependency, soil mycorrhizal infectivity, and mycorrhizal receptivity of soil. Decreased use of fertilizers, pesticides, and tillage will favour arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. However, shifting from one system to a more sustainable one is not easy since all components of the cropping system are closely linked. Different cases, from actual agricultural practices in different countries, are analyzed to highlight situations in which mycorrhizae might or might not play a role in developing more sustainable agriculture.

551,pub.1013253385,10.1007/s10750-006-0463-y,,,,Community structure of the macroinfauna inhabiting tidal flats characterized by the presence of different species of burrowing bivalves in Southern Chile,"Several species of bivalves coexist at the lower intertidal of large tidal flats located in the enclosed or inland coast of the northern area of the Nord-Patagonic archipelagos on the Chilean coast (ca. 40–42°S): Tagelus dombeii (Lamarck), Mulinia edulis (King & Broderip), Venus antiqua King & Broderip, Semele solida (Gray), Gari solida (Gray) and Diplodonta insconspicua Philippi. To explore possible spatial variation in the community structure of the macroinfauna inhabiting sediments with different assemblages of these bivalves, seasonal sampling was carried out during 2003–2004 at two tidal flats of that area. Higher species richness and specimen densities of the macroinfauna occurred in sediments with the higher densities of bivalves, especially in sediments where the deep burrower T. dombeii reaches its greatest abundances. Our results suggest that, apart from presence of bivalves, the burrowing depth of these organisms is also important in promoting the abundance of macroinfauna. Our results are in contrast with earlier conceptualizations for community organization of the soft bottom macroinfauna inhabiting intertidal flats, related to biological interactions occurring among different phyletic groups, such as that arguing that suspension feeding bivalves (such as T. dombeii and V. antiqua) will negatively affect the recruitment of species with planktonic larvae, by filtering them before they become established in the substrate. Thus, it is concluded that beneficial effects of bivalve bioturbation overcome that negative effects on the macroinfauna, although detrimental effects may well occur at bivalve densities higher than those studied here.","To M.

Although the effects of climate change on ecosystems are currently a major concern, the issues tightly associated with winter climate change have been underrepresented. Given the importance of winter climate variables and events for determining the spatial distribution of communities and their phenological and physiological responses, and the functional roles of each species, all of which are expected to substantially influence community dis/re‐assemble in the future, this review focuses on the ecological responses and consequences of terrestrial communities to changing winter climate. In particular, the effects on processes supported by biological interactions are largely undetermined. In this context, focusing on plant–soil feedback as a major interactive multi‐system is worthwhile; these interactions can be disentangled through careful evaluation of the functional roles of organisms involved in the feedback (i.e., plants and soil organisms). The underlying mechanisms are indeed complex because direct (i.e., changes in physical conditions) and indirect pathways (i.e., plant‐mediated influences on soil‐organisms and vice versa) from winter climate change influence the functionality of future ecosystems. To face these issues, the framework of response–effect‐traits deserves research priority since this can define community re‐organization as the accumulated responses of individual species, which determines the stability and performance of ecosystem functioning. Thus, research that quantifies functional responses and roles of organisms under a changing climate will continue to be essential for the issues of winter climate change, which may become more serious and significant in the near future.",We thank Makoto Kobayashi for organizing the symposium on winter climate change held during the annual meeting of the Ecological Society of Japan.

551,pub.1151953930,10.1007/s12542-022-00641-7,,,,Turtle barnacles have been turtle riders for more than 30 million years,"In contrast to other kinds of biological interactions, symbiosis is a scarcely investigated aspect of the fossil record. This is largely due to taphonomic biases that often frustrate any attempt to make a strong case that two organisms shared an intimate association in life. Among extant marine vertebrates, the sea turtles (Cheloniidae and Dermochelyidae) bear a broad and diverse spectrum of epibiotic symbionts, including specialists such as the turtle barnacles (Chelonibiidae and Platyleapadidae). Here, we reappraise an early Oligocene (Rupelian) fossil cheloniid skeleton, featuring the remains of cirripedes on the exterior of its entoplastron, from the Rauenberg fossil-lagerstätte, southwestern Germany. The barnacle specimens are assigned to Protochelonibia melleni, an extinct protochelonibiine species and the geologically oldest known member of Chelonibiidae. In the light of taphonomic and palaeoenvironmental considerations, and given that the extant chelonibiids are mostly known as epizoic symbionts of sea turtles, we conclude that this unique fossil association resulted from the epizoic growth of the barnacles on the external surface of the plastron of the turtle during its lifetime. This remarkable fossil association provides evidence that chelonibiids, including the extinct protochelonibiines, have been chelonophilic epizoans for more than 30 Myr. A survey of the trace and body fossil records shows that platylepadids are also likely as old as the Rupelian as is their symbiotic association with cheloniid hosts. This early emergence of the modern-looking, turtle-dwelling barnacle lineages corresponds to a climate-driven phase of major radiation and taxonomic turnover among sea turtles at the Eocene–Oligocene transition.","We are grateful to Doug Perrine and Mark Flint for generously sharing their own photographs of extant chelonibiids and cheloniids.

We reviewed the evidence for climate and landscape change impacts on freshwater biodiversity in real-world ecosystems at the global scale. Using our compiled database of 150 studies, we asked (1) what are the study characteristics within the available evidence base and (2) what are the main knowledge gaps and recommendations for future research?Recent FindingsMost studies employed an observational design and examined climatic and landscape change trends over a broad regional spatial scale (median = 97 sites/study). Ecological complexity was well represented in studies with a median of 11 predictor variables that characterized the relevant climate, landscape condition, and many other environmental attributes. Community-level metrics were common response types across all biota including larger, more mobile organisms such as fish that are challenging to examine in an ecologically-relevant context within controlled laboratory settings.SummaryWe identified several knowledge gaps including the need for more published time-series data, particularly with respect to understanding climate change impacts. Other opportunities for improved future research included incorporating more stressor and biological interactions, examining potential climate stressors over multiple seasons and streamlining methods for dealing with the pervasive challenges of multicollinearity in real-world systems. We emphasize the unique role of ‘natural experiments’ in validating experimental findings and provide a suite of recommendations for creating more strategic field studies to inform conservation efforts.","We thank Mike Dusevic, Brooke Etherington, and Patrice Mathieu for their assistance with data screening.

For instance, seed dispersal by birds can increase seed rain, seed germination, and, as a consequence, the probability of establishment of new invasion foci. Schefflera arboricola, an ornamental shrub with fruits largely consumed by birds, is invasive in several countries. To our knowledge, this is the first research project on mechanisms that might explain the success of S. arboricola in areas where it is invasive. The main aim of this study was to assess the invasiveness of S. arboricola associated with seed dispersal by birds. Fruit availability and frugivory interactions with local birds were registered and the germination percentage of seeds not consumed by birds was compared to the germination of seeds collected from bird feces. Our results show that frugivory and seed dispersal by native birds increase the establishment of S. arboricola. In addition, intrinsic species traits such as extended flowering and fruiting, high percentage of seed germination, early germination due to frugivory, and ability to establish in different microhabitats facilitate invasion by S. arboricola. Given the intensive horticultural use of S. arboricola and seed dispersal interactions with generalist birds, there is an imminent risk of invasion in forest remnants close to wherever S. arboricola is cultivated. We recommend that adult plants of S. arboricola are eliminated from gardens and semi-natural areas close to protected areas as a prevention measure to avoid invasions and impacts on natural habitats.","We thank F.

Despite this, ecological information on the species, including its biological interactions and habitat use, is scarce, especially for the Andes. In some regions, Nasua nasua is sympatric with other closely related species of the Procyonidae family, including the mountain coati Nasuella olivacea. Here, we assess the influence of environmental and anthropogenic factors on the occupancy of these two species and the spatial and temporal bases of their co-occurrence along an elevational gradient. Camera trapping (with 85 camera-trap stations) was conducted during the dry season of 2016 along elevations from 1600 to 3600 m above sea level (m. a. s. l.) in northern Peru. We observed a total of 244 detections for Nasua nasua and 17 for Nasuella olivacea over 9457 cumulative camera-days. Occupancy modelling (Royle-Nichols model) showed that Nasua nasua occupancy was significantly and negatively related to elevation but positively related to forest cover. In contrast, Nasuella olivacea occupancy was significantly and positively related to elevation. In addition, Nasuella olivacea was detected in only 5 of the 45 total sites occupied by Nasua nasua; therefore, spatial overlap was low. Consequently, co-occurrence modelling based on a Bayesian approach showed no evidence of avoidance between the two coati species. Additionally, activity patterns suggest low levels of temporal overlap; however, we consider this a preliminary finding due to the limited number of detections for Nasuella olivacea. Our results not only increase the understanding of the ecology of both Nasua nasua and Nasuella olivacea but also provide information towards their conservation in this part of their distribution range.","We are grateful to the institutions that made this study possible, the administration office of the Tabaconas Namballe National Sanctuary and the National Service of Natural Protected Areas (SERNANP).

Accumulating evidence seems to suggest that defensive mutualism provides the best framework for understanding plant-endophyte interactions in general. We conducted a meta-analysis of 99 published studies on 36 plant (inc. both grass and tree species), 62 herbivore and 17 predator or parasitoid taxons to test the importance of defensive mutualism in multitrophic interactions. In general, statistical perusal revealed that we still know little about these seemingly well-studied biological interactions. The conceptual framework for endophyte-grass interactions has largely been based on endophyte-plant-herbivore studies of two, economically important, artificially selected and introduced agricultural grass species, tall fescue and perennial ryegrass, and two generalist invertebrate pests. Only 10 original publications provided data of higher trophic levels. Consistent with the defensive mutualism hypothesis, the meta-analysis indicates that endophytes slightly increase grass resistance to herbivores, and the defensive mutualism appears to be most commonly detected in systemic and vertically transmitted grass endophytes compared to horizontally transmitted tree endophytes. However, variation appears to increase when higher trophic levels are considered. In addition to taxonomical bias, the literature is strongly biased toward short-term laboratory and greenhouse experiments rather than field conditions. Thus, current literature is insufficient to capture the breadth of variability inherent in the wild grass-endophyte populations and communities, and the general importance of defensive mutualism remains to be solved in future studies.",This study was funded by the Academy of Finland (Project no. 110658).,,Fungal Diversity,,Springer Nature,"1560-2745, 1878-9129",,2010-01-30,2010,2010-01-30,2010-03,41,1,101-113,Closed,Article,"Saikkonen, Kari; Saari, S.; Helander, M.","Saikkonen, Kari (MTT Agrifood Research Finland, Plant protection, 31600, Jokioinen, Finland); Saari, S.

551,pub.1029116052,10.1016/j.ecss.2016.11.011,,,,Resource utilization and trophic niche width in sandy beach macrobenthos from an oligotrophic coast,"One of the paradigms underlying sandy beach ecology is the overriding control by physical processes; thus, biological interactions (i.e. food availability, competition and predation) are believed to play a role structuring macrofaunal communities only in benign habitats such as dissipative beaches. Moreover, sandy beaches are characterized by low in-situ productivity, so their food webs rely heavily on marine inputs. Studies have shown that estuarine organic matter plays a key role in influencing the dynamics of marine ecosystems. However, very few studies have tested the role of estuarine input on sandy beaches. Here, we aim to determine the impact of estuarine input on the food web of a sandy beach macrobenthic community. To this end, particulate organic matter (POM) samples from the marine environment and the estuary, as well as macrobenthic samples from the beach, were analysed for their stable isotope (SI) signature. Our results indicated that the POM SI signatures were not different along the beach, but differences were recorded between marine and estuarine sources. Bayesian mixing models indicated that the organisms did not make use of the estuarine POM at the beginning of the wet season, but relied more heavily on this resource towards the end of the wet season. This leads to the conclusion that changes in estuarine flow throughout the wet season can impact the trophic structure of macrobenthos communities, confirming a link between lotic and marine communities. Moreover, SI signatures suggest that the species collected here exhibit overlapping trophic niches, indicating high level of inter-specific competition. This highlights that species in low-productivity areas, such as the one studied here, can experience high levels of competition even in physically controlled environments such as sandy beaches.","This study was financed by the NRF-IRDP project (KZN Coastal Trophic Flows, ICD2006072700035).

To identify the biological cause of density dependence, we manipulated both population density and the availability of shelter (crevices used as refuges from predators) in small plots of continuous reef. We detected strong density‐dependent mortality in plots with few refuges, but mortality was density independent in plots with abundant refuges, indicating that limited shelter causes density dependence. Predator density was unrelated to the density of gobies and refuges, suggesting that predators displayed a type III functional response in patches with few refuges. In a second experiment, we manipulated goby density within replicate plots of three sizes (4, 16, and 64 m2) that varied naturally in the availability of refuges. If refuge availability was ignored, mortality appeared to be density independent at all scales. If, however, plots were grouped by refuge availability, mortality was density dependent in plots with few refuges, but low and density independent in plots with many refuges at all spatial scales. Understanding the mechanism of density dependence (refuge shortage) was thus required to measure the strength of density dependence in natural, spatially variable, habitat. We suggest that density dependence was detectable in plots of different sizes because the relationships between the densities of gobies, refuges, and goby predators were similar across the spatial scales we studied. Our work demonstrates that identifying the biological interactions that cause density dependence, and characterizing the spatial domains at which those interactions operate, will be important to accurately assess the effects of density dependence on population dynamics.","Many thanks to all of those who helped us with field work, including Danielle Ameen, Scott Bull, Bryn Evans, Ian Greenspan, Liz Kintzing, Linda O&#x27;Bryan, Rachel Finley, Amy Karpenske, Jenna Krug, Jameal Samhouri, Jake Sausman, Julie Standish, Jeff Schinske, Eric Tynes, Jessica Tallman, Chau Tran, Denise Weisman, and Clare Wormald.

An introduction is doomed to fail if any one of these factors is unsuitable. A few Atlantic blue crab Callinectes sapidus Rathbun, 1896 specimens have been collected along a limited stretch of the central Portuguese coast since the late 1970s, but a viable population was never detected. However, starting in 2016, a population of the Atlantic blue crab has established and expanded along the southern Portuguese coast. The objective of the present study was to provide insights into the invasion of the Atlantic blue crab in Portugal based on unpublished museum collection records and new records made by citizen scientists on the western coast and to provide a mechanistic explanation for the recent expansion based on observational oceanography data. Citizen science records along with observational oceanography data from 2019 and 2020 suggest that the southern Portugal population is expanding towards the western coast due to warmer coastal countercurrent events that form in the Gulf of Cadiz during the reproductive period of the Atlantic blue crab (summer–early fall). This oceanographic feature facilitates the transport of larvae towards the western coast of Portugal, which increases propagule pressure, while estuaries along the southwestern coast may serve as stepping stones supporting the northwards expansion of the species in tandem with increasing sea temperature. This study also highlights the value of citizen science in detecting the range expansion of invasive species over wide geographical areas.","The authors greatly appreciate the contribution of each citizen scientist to the NEMA campaign.

In this study, we test the hypothesis that phylogeographical patterns of coral‐dependent fish species inhabiting the peninsula may be driven by a combination of ocean circulation, larval behaviour and seascape features. Arabian Peninsula. Coral reef fish. A biophysical modelling system that relies on stochastic Lagrangian framework and Individual‐Based Model was used to simulate larval dispersal through three putative barriers, by tracking three‐dimensional movements of virtual particles in ocean circulation scenarios. We explored the range of dispersal capabilities across reef fish species by creating 72 hypothetical strategies, each representing a unique combination of five biological traits, namely pelagic larval duration, spawning periodicity, mortality rate, reproductive output and vertical migration. The strength of the barriers was highly variable as a function of all biological traits (except reproductive output) and indicated high asymmetry of connectivity, and hence gene flow, between adjacent areas. In addition, direction and distance travelled by the virtual larvae varied according to both the geographical position of releasing site and biannual monsoonal winds. On average, larvae released during the summer exhibited a higher potential for dispersal than larvae released during the winter. Our biophysical models showed that in the Arabian Peninsula, the combination of hydrodynamic, seascape features and larval traits likely affects the distribution of genetic lineages due to the interruption, reduction or asymmetry of larval movements through the putative barriers.",ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The author F.T. is supported by a CNPq/Brazil fellowship through the programme Science Without Borders (Proc. 232875/2014‐6).

Knowledge about the biology of the Symphrasinae is summarized, and all biological interactions are tabulated. Larvae of all species whose biology has been documented are ectoparasitoids of larvae and pupae of holometabolous insects. Species of Plega Navás, 1928, and apparently of Anchieta Navás, 1909 probably have a generalist feeding ecology with primary larvae actively seeking for hosts, likely with some degree of “host-searching” ability of the females. Meanwhile, species of Trichoscelia Westwood, 1852 appear to have a specialized feeding on larvae and pupae of the vespid wasps Polybia Lepeletier, 1836, as well as a complex mechanism to invade wasp nests. The egg and first larval instar of Plega are described and illustrated. The main characteristics of the genus are discussed in a comparative context of the known primary larva and egg of Mantispoidea. The genus is distinguished among other Mantispoidea by the presence of a elongate head capsule, with two anterolateral stemmata, inwardly curved mandibulo-maxillary stylets, where the mandibles are robust with serrate apex; in the labium, the postmentum is enlarged and subquadrate and the palpus is 2-segmented, although a first palpomere was probably fused to the prementum; the legs have all the podomeres differentiated as separate subunits, with setal characters providing a landmark to understand the leg morphology of Mantispa Illiger, 1798, in which a partial fusion of the tibia and tarsus has taken place.","This article is part of AAC&#x27;s doctoral dissertation as partial fulfillment to the requirements for the degree at Posgrado en Ciencias Biológicas, UNAM.

551,pub.1107329698,10.1016/s0140-1963(18)30684-0,,,,Ecology of coastal dune fauna,"The distinguishing feature of coastal dunes is their connection to the shore. This maritime influence results in most coastal dunefields exhibiting a marked shore-normal gradient of decreasing physical stress and increasing complexity and vegetation cover landwards. Physical stresses include sand movement, salt spray, temperature variability, wind and disturbances such as storms. Increasing vegetation cover, often coupled to succession, mediates physical stress, creates stable microenvironments and is responsible for a general increase in habitat complexity landwards. Fauna respond to this gradient in a number of ways. Crustaceans of marine origin decrease in abundance landwards. Many of the special adaptations, which equip fauna for psammophilic lifestyles and allow them to cope with salt spray and temperature extremes, are only encountered near the beach. Insects, vertebrates and interstitial fauna increase in abundance landwards as vegetation cover, height and diversity increase, soil develops and greater stability is attained. Biological interactions and impacts of fauna on vegetation via grazing, seed dispersal and disturbance also increase landwards. There may be a shift from primarily r-strategist species near the beach to k-strategists inland and birds may replace small mammals as vegetation height increases. Coastal dune fauna differs from that of deserts in being more diverse and having a well developed interstitial component. Furthermore, coastal dune inhabitants are less specialised to cope with physical extremes and are seldom unique or endemic to these systems. However, this fauna has received considerably less attention than that of desert dunes and much research is warranted on subjects such as adaptations to sand movement and salt spray, endemism, trophic relations and exchanges with adjacent systems. Wind is the major factor impinging on these dune ecosystems.",,,Journal of Arid Environments,,Elsevier,"0140-1963, 1095-922X",,1991-09,1991,,1991-09,21,2,229-243,Closed,Article,"McLachlan, Anton","McLachlan, Anton (Department of Zoology, University of Port Elizabeth, South Africa)",,"McLachlan, Anton (Nelson Mandela University)",Nelson Mandela University,grid.412139.c,Port Elizabeth,,South Africa,,,,,,71,14,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1107329698,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 37 Earth Sciences; 41 Environmental Sciences,,,,,,C14 Geography and Environmental Studies,

In this study, we analysed patterns of growth in three abundant sublittoral sponges from the western Mediterranean Sea, chosen for their close phylogenetic relatedness, sympatric distribution, and contrasting amounts of photosymbionts: high in Irciniafasciculata, lower in I. variabilis, and absent in I. oros. Sponge area, perimeter, number of oscula, and epibiont abundance were quantified from in situ digital images taken monthly for 1.5 years and volumetric growth rates were calculated from empirical area–volume relationships. Volumetric growth rates were different among species and coherent with the photosymbiont abundance: high in I. fasciculata (40.03 ± 4.81 % year−1, mean ± SE), low in I. variabilis (5.65 ± 6.11 % year−1), and almost nil in I. oros (−0.04 ± 3.02 % year−1). Furthermore, a marked seasonality was observed in the first two species, with greater growth during the warm season. The high growth rates of I. fasciculata were likely fuelled by symbiont-derived photosynthates and required to compete in the well-lit, algal-dominated habitats this species prefers. In contrast, I. variabilis and I. oros tended to dwell in shaded habitats, where competition from slow-growing invertebrates is intense, and featured lower growth rates. The flattened morphology and lower circularity of I. variabilis indicates a capacity for adaptation to any space that is freed, while I. oros had less oscula and was more massive and circular, suggesting a strategy of passive occupation and minimisation of biological interactions. The results show that even congeneric species living sympatrically can achieve important biomass using different growth and substrate occupation strategies.","We thank Dr. S López-Legentil (UB) for critically reading previous versions of the manuscript and F.

To characterize habitats along the estuarine gradient, we measured several abiotic and biotic variables concurrently with gillnet sampling. Juvenile (age-0 and age-1+) bluefish were captured regularly during both years along with large numbers of Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), which were confirmed by diet analyses to be bluefish’s primary forage species. The date of initial appearance of age-0 bluefish and menhaden in the estuary varied between years and may have been related to interannual differences in seawater temperatures on the continental shelf during spring. Delayed estuarine arrival of prey fishes may have contributed to variability in bluefish diets between years. Within the estuary, bluefish spatial distribution were consistent across seasons and years: bluefish were most common in areas associated with high concentrations of suspended materials and the presence of menhaden. Community analyses also indicated habitat overlap between bluefish and menhaden. Spatial distribution patterns revealed the consistent occurrence of piscivorous bluefish in shallow estuarine habitats that retained suspended materials and aggregated prey fishes. Foraging success of bluefish and other estuarine piscivores may be closely linked with the availability of these productive habitat, highlighting the need for future study of biological interactions and the governing physical processes.",,,Estuaries and Coasts,,Springer Nature,"1559-2723, 1559-2731, 0160-8347",,2004-06,2004,,2004-06,27,3,426-436,Closed,Article,"Scharf, Frederick S.; Manderson, John P.; Fabrizio, Mary C.; Pessutti, Jeffrey P.; Rosendale, John E.; Chant, Robert J.; Bejda, Allen J.","Scharf, Frederick S.

We present results from a high-resolution (sub-hourly to sub-daily) hydrodynamic and biogeochemical study, along with a coupled long-term (several months) hydrodynamic study, conducted on the back reefs of Ofu, American Samoa. During the high-resolution study, mean temperature was 29.0 °C with maximum temperatures near 32 °C. Dissolved oxygen concentrations spanned 32–178 % saturation, and pHT spanned the range from 7.80 to 8.39 with diel ranges reaching 0.58 units. Empirical cumulative distribution functions reveal that pHT was between 8.0 and 8.2 during only 30 % of the observational period, with approximately even distribution of the remaining 70 % of the time between pHT values less than 8.0 and greater than 8.2. Thermal and biogeochemical variability in the back reefs is partially controlled by tidal modulation of wave-driven flow, which isolates the back reefs at low tide and brings offshore water into the back reefs at high tide. The ratio of net community calcification to net community production was 0.15 ± 0.01, indicating that metabolism on the back reef was dominated by primary production and respiration. Similar to other back reef systems, the back reefs of Ofu are carbon sinks during the daytime. Shallow back reefs like those in Ofu may provide insights for how coral communities respond to extreme temperatures and acidification and are deserving of continued attention.","This manuscript benefitted greatly from the thoughtful comments of two anonymous reviewers and Heidi Hirsh.

551,pub.1037184395,10.1111/j.1439-0485.2007.00148.x,,,,Experimental evidence of habitat provision by aggregations of Riftia pachyptila at hydrothermal vents on the East Pacific Rise,"Habitat created or modified by the physical architecture of large or spatially dominant species plays an important role in structuring communities in a variety of terrestrial, aquatic, and marine habitats. At hydrothermal vents, the giant tubeworm Riftia pachyptila forms large and dense aggregations in a spatially and temporally variable environment. The density and diversity of smaller invertebrates is higher in association with aggregations of R. pachyptila than on the surrounding basalt rock seafloor. Artificial substrata designed to mimic R. pachyptila aggregations were deployed along a gradient of productivity to test the hypothesis that high local species diversity is maintained by the provision of complex physical structure in areas of diffuse hydrothermal flow. After 1 year, species assemblages were compared among artificial aggregations in low‐, intermediate‐, and high‐productivity zones and compared to natural aggregations of R. pachyptila from the same site. Hydrothermal vent fauna colonized every artificial aggregation, and both epifaunal density and species richness were highest in areas of high chemosynthetic primary production. The species richness was also similar between natural aggregations of R. pachyptila and artificial aggregations in intermediate‐ and high‐productivity zones, suggesting that complex physical structure alone can support local species diversity in areas of chemosynthetic primary production. Differences in the community composition between natural and artificial aggregations reflect the variability in microhabitat conditions and biological interactions associated with hydrothermal fluid flux at low‐temperature hydrothermal vents. Moreover, these local ecological factors may further contribute to the maintenance of regional species diversity in hydrothermal vent communities on the East Pacific Rise.","We would like to express our gratitude to the captain and crew of the R/V Atlantis and the pilots and crew of the DSV Alvin for the expertise, professionalism, and generosity in shipboard and submersible operations.

The fossil-bearing beds were deposited in littoral to sublittoral environments within sediments of mostly pyroclastic origin. We interpret many traces to have been produced by predators and/or scavengers while the penguins were still in a breeding area. Many bones show cracking marks due to aerial exposure. The material is disarticulated as is usual in recent breeding areas. Potential predators were coeval terrestrial mammals, most probably marsupial carnivores. After a marine transgression, these bones were buried or exposed on the sea bottom where they could be colonized by algae, sponges, cnidarians, and other benthic organisms. We identified sponge borings in several bones. Other traces are interpreted to have been produced by echinoderms feeding on sponges or algae. No evidence of other invertebrate predators such as muricid or naticid gastropods, or decapods was found. Finally, other traces appear to have been generated by shark and possibly teleostean vertebrates feeding on epibionts. One coracoid is interpreted to have been marked by a shark that is common in the Gaiman Formation, the carcharhiniform Galeocerdo aduncus. From an ethological (Seilacherian) classification, traces on bones from the Gaiman Formation include Domichnia (sponge perforations), Praedichnia (terrestrial marsupials, sharks, teleosteans) and Pasichnia (echinoderms). Remarkably, remains of marine organisms with skeletons made of calcium carbonate are very poorly preserved in the Gaiman Formation. Only large oysters, sparse shell fragments, skeletal moulds, and bioturbation is evident. The fossil assemblage is mainly composed of phosphatic (e.g. teeth, bones, crustacean parts) and siliceous (sponge spicules, diatoms) remains.","We thank the Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas and Universidad Nacional de La Plata for financial support.

We designed a simulation model of a three-species acarine system, containing a phytophagous tetranychid mite, Panonychus ulmi Koch, and two predators: a phytoseiid (Typhlodromus caudiglans Schuster) and a stigmaeid (Zetzellia mali Ewing) to attempt to complement the extreme precision of an empirical transition matrix model of the same system of Woolhouse and Harmsen (1987), with biological realism. As Woolhouse and Harmsen speculated, but were unable to show using their empirical model, our simulation model demonstrated that age structure, availability of prey and abundance of predators are important determinants of the dynamics of the acarine system. More specifically, our model provided evidence that age structure and life history (particularly that of P. ulmi), the overall functional response of predators, the high preference of stigmaeids for P. ulmi eggs and other stigmaeid characteristics such as cannibalism all strongly influence predator-prey and predator-predator interactions. Both model types are useful for management purposes: the empirical or statistical approach produces accurate predictions, but cannot provide managers with information on how to manipulate the biology of the system to produce favorable conditions for control; the mechanistic or reductionist approach provides information on how complex biological interactions affect overall population dynamics, but cannot provide the same degree of precision as the empirical approach. We suggest that using two or more modeling approaches to the same problem, each seeking to maximize one of the three recognized aims in ecological modeling (i.e. realism, precision and generality), may be an efficient method for achieving a more complete understanding of ecological systems.",,,Ecological Modelling,,Elsevier,"0304-3800, 1872-7026",,1991-12,1991,,1991-12,59,3-4,257-277,Closed,Article,"Clements, David R.; Harmsen, Rudolf; Clements, Peter J.","Clements, David R.

The surface water layer influenced by the low salinity Black Sea waters (BSW) is considered in this paper. We attempted to study horizontal distribution patterns of major mesozooplankters within a more comprehensive framework, taking into account not only hydrology but also available, concurrently collected data on lower trophic levels (autotrophic and microbial heterotrophic communities). BSW was mainly restricted in the eastern part of the surveyed area where it was entrapped in a ca. 50-km wide anticyclone (the “Samothraki” gyre). High Chlα concentrations, autotrophic biomass as well as abundance and biomass of mesozooplankton were associated with the BSW, with the highest values recorded inside the gyre as well as at its coastal northern periphery and the lowest values towards the western and offshore part of the surveyed area characterized by high salinity waters of Levantine origin. Among mesozooplankters, cladocerans (mainly Penilia avirostris) showed a high abundance within the gyre in contrast to the very low abundance of copepods and appendicularians. Low salinity-high temperature gyre waters were characterized by the dominance of cyanobacteria of the genus Synechococcus in autotrophic biomass and the significant contribution of heterotrophic nanoflagellates in microbial heterotrophic biomass. Based on existing knowledge on ecophysiological traits and prey size-spectra selectivity, we discuss the observed distribution patterns of major mesozooplankton groups in terms of ambient abiotic parameters and the possible biological interactions among these groups as well as with lower or upper trophic levels.",The present study was supported by the EU project ANREC (QLRT-2001-01216).

Fewer studies have considered interactions between root glucosinolates and soil organisms. Similarly, data comparing local and systemic changes in glucosinolate levels after root- and shoot-induction are scarce. An analysis of 74 studies on constitutive root and shoot glucosinolates of 29 plant species showed that overall, roots have higher concentrations and a greater diversity of glucosinolates than shoots. Roots have significantly higher levels of the aromatic 2-phenylethyl glucosinolate, possibly related to the greater effectiveness and toxicity of its hydrolysis products in soil. In shoots, the most dominant indole glucosinolate is indol-3-ylglucosinolate, whereas roots are dominated by its methoxyderivatives. Indole glucosinolates were the most responsive after jasmonate or salicylate induction, but increases after jasmonate induction were most pronounced in the shoot. In general, root glucosinolate levels did not change as strongly as shoot levels. We postulate that roots may rely more on high constitutive levels of glucosinolates, due to the higher and constant pathogen pressure in soil communities. The differences in root and shoot glucosinolate patterns are further discussed in relation to the molecular regulation of glucosinolate biosynthesis, the within-tissue distribution of glucosinolates in the roots, and the use of glucosinolate-containing crops for biofumigation. Comparative studies of tissue-specific biosynthesis and regulation in relation to the biological interactions in aboveground and belowground environments are needed to advance investigations of the evolution and further utilization of glucosinolates in natural and managed ecosystems.",,,Phytochemistry Reviews,,Springer Nature,"1568-7767, 1572-980X",,2008-06-06,2008,2008-06-06,2009-01,8,1,171-186,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"van Dam, Nicole M.; Tytgat, Tom O.

A simple numerical model of tidal current hydrodynamics was developed based on field measurements of shear stresses near the bottom. Burrowing behavior of bivalves was incorporated into the model of bedload transport by using estimates of entrainment rates of Gemma gemma and Mya arenaria in a laboratory flume, and jump lengths of the bivalves were estimated by methods previously developed for noncohesive particles. Based on the flood domination and strong gradient of shear stresses in the Navesink estuary, our model predicted that juvenile bivalves would accumulate in the center of the estuary, traveling up to several kilometers over 30 days. Field distributions of juvenile bivalves were consistent with the model predictions for other species of bivalves but not for G. gemma, for which field distributions of both <500- and >500-μm individuals were concentrated in the eastern end of the estuary. Differences between the bedload model and G. gemma distributions suggest that spatial variation in burrowing behavior or biological interactions are playing an important role in maintaining distribution patterns of this species in spite of high levels of bedload transport. This modeling approach is applicable to other juvenile benthic invertebrates that disperse as bedload and is a useful model against which to compare field observations of rates of transport and patterns of distribution and abundance.","E.

During the investigations of forest arboreal small mammals using wood nest boxes between January and December 2021, nestings of Camponotus kiusiuensis Santschi were observed at high frequencies in a census site on Mount Kyougatake, Saga Prefecture, Kyushu, Japan. We surveyed the nesting site preference of C. kiusiuensis and conducted monthly observations of colony compositions from spring to winter. Among three types of nest boxes, small (500 cm3), medium (1,000 cm3), and large (2,000 cm3), C. kiusiuensis nested in the large nest boxes at significantly higher frequencies. Although the nest boxes were either set at low (1.5–2.0 m high) or high (3.5–4.0 m high) positions of trees, no significant differences were detected in the nesting sites between them. The number of colonies was the highest in April and it gradually decreased from spring to autumn. In the nest boxes in which colonies of C. kiusiuensis were continuously observed until autumn, the developmental stages of immature individuals inside were almost uniform: larvae were observed from April to June, pupae in July, and many adults including males and new alate queens were found in August and September. No or very few ant individuals were observed in October and November, suggesting that workers moved the larvae to other places in late autumn.

By comparison, biogeographers study the distribution of the same organisms, but focus on historic, larger‐scale processes that can cause mass mortalities, such as earthquakes. Here we document cascading effects of rare biogeographical (seismic) and more common ecological (temperature‐related) processes on the distribution and abundances of coastal foundation species. Intertidal wave‐exposed rocky reefs around Kaikōura, New Zealand, dominated by large, long‐lived, and iconic southern bull kelps (Durvillaea antarctica and Durvillaea willana). In November 2016, a 7.8 Mw earthquake uplifted the coastline around Kaikōura by up to 2 m, and a year later the region experienced the hottest summer on record. Extensive sampling of intertidal communities over 15 km coastline were done shortly after the earthquake and heatwaves and 4 years after the earthquake. Durvillaea lost 75% of its canopy to uplift and the heatwaves reduced canopies that had survived the uplift by an additional 35%. The survey done 4 years after the earthquake showed that Durvillaea had not recovered and that the intertidal zone in many places now was dominated by small turfs and foliose seaweed. Cascading impacts from seismic uplift and heatwaves have destroyed populations of Durvillaea around Kaikōura. Surviving smaller and sparser Durvillaea patches will likely compromise capacity for self‐replacement and lower resilience to future stressors. These results are discussed in a global biogeographical‐ecological context of seismic activity and extreme heatwaves and highlight that these events, which are not particularly rare in a geological context, may have common long‐lasting ecological legacies.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This research was supported by a grant from Brian Mason (Impacts of marine heatwaves) and with support from the Ministry of Primary Industries and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (earthquake impacts and recovery‐UOCX1704).

Theory suggests that the role of interspecific competition can be significant in the maintenance of elevation replacement distributions. Despite this, there has been limited work investigating factors beyond thermophysiology in determining ranges in temperate montane species.Objectives and methodsWe investigated agonistic (i.e. aggressive) behaviour in response to a simulated intruder (conspecific versus heterospecific 3D printed models) in two sister species of temperate montane lizard, Liopholis guthega and L. montana, from south-eastern Australia. The two species have similar thermal tolerances at an area of distributional overlap between 1600 and 1700 m above sea level, above which L. montana is replaced by the high elevation specialist L. guthega.ResultsWe found that response to intruder stimuli differed between the two species, with the high elevation L. guthega actively biting both conspecific and heterospecific models, whereas the lower elevation L. montana, never attacked either model type. Our findings provide evidence of asymmetric agonistic response in the two montane reptile species.ConclusionsThese findings have important implications for understanding how biological interactions and behaviour, in addition to thermo-physiological data, might mediate landscape scale distribution patterns both now and as environments change in the future. More broadly, our results are not consistent with the widespread idea that low elevation species will inevitably ‘push’ higher elevation species out, as global warming erodes species’ thermal envelopes.","We acknowledge First Nations Australians of the Ngarigo and Wurundjeri, upon whose land this research was undertaken.

Using two congeneric limpet species, with different biogeographic distributions, and whose ranges are expected to alter with climatic warming, we separated the magnitude of their grazing activity over time and the subsequent consequence for macroalgal growth.The northern/boreal limpet, Patella vulgata (L.), consistently grazed more than the southern/lusitanian limpet, P. depressa (Pennant), particularly during spring and summer when P. depressa was reproductively active. Individuals of Fucus vesiculosus (L.) that settled during this time were able to grow to a size where they escaped the grazing activities of P. depressa, resulting in mature F. vesiculosus being present in all P. depressa treatments. In contrast, P. vulgata, which was not reproductively active during this period, exhibited no reduction in its grazing activity and prevented macroalgae from growing in experimental treatments. It therefore appears that P. vulgata has a stronger role, than P. depressa, in controlling macroalgal abundance on shores of southwest Britain.We present a conceptual model highlighting the direct and indirect interactions between these two limpet species and F. vesiculosis. If as predicted, under current warming scenarios, P. depressa becomes the dominant limpet on shores of southwest Britain there will be subsequent changes in rocky shore community structure and ecosystem functioning. Our research emphasises that even closely related species with similar ecological niches can exhibit different behaviours that fundamentally alter their biological interactions with other organisms leading to idiosyncratic responses to predicted changes in climate.","PM was funded by a joint studentship from the University of Plymouth and the Marine Biological Association of the UK.

It is the main prey of endangered species, it causes severe impacts on vegetation, as well as has a considerable hunting economic value but damages agriculture. We assessed drivers of European rabbit habitat selection on Fuerteventura Island (Canary Islands, Spain) in order to understand the ecology and to contribute with data for managing this introduced species. To measure rabbit abundance, we counted the total number of fresh pellets and latrines. We used Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) to analyze the relationship between rabbit abundance and four groups of variables that represented the biological requirements of the species (environmental, food resources, refuges/shelters, and biological interactions). Hierarchical partitioning techniques were used to estimate the explanatory capacity of these different groups of variables. Our model better explained fresh pellet abundance (89% of total deviance) than latrine abundance (57%). Variables related to food resources best explained the abundance of both latrines and pellets. We identified a set of plant species highly correlated with rabbit abundance, which probably makes up the species’ diet. Variables relating to refuge/shelter and the environmental were also relevant. Interactions with other mammals did not strongly affect rabbit abundance on Fuerteventura Island. Mean annual precipitation and temperature were variables that individually best explained abundance, although half of their relevance is shared with others non-environmental variables. Our results provide policy makers and land-managers with applied information on the relationship between rabbit populations and micro-scale components of Fuerteventura.","We are sincerely grateful to José A.

Some organisms use other species as substrates for attachment, shelter, feeding or parasitism, but there may also be mutual benefits from the association. Here, we highlight the structural attributes and biotic effects of the habitats that corals, sea pens, sponges and xenophyophores offer other organisms. The environmental setting of the biological structures influences their species composition. The importance of benthic species as substrates seems to increase with depth as the complexity of the surrounding geological substrate and food supply decline. There are marked differences in the degree of mutualistic relationships between habitat‐forming taxa. This is especially evident for scleractinian corals, which have high numbers of facultative associates (commensals) and few obligate associates (mutualists), and gorgonians, with their few commensals and many obligate associates. Size, flexibility and architectural complexity of the habitat‐forming organism are positively related to species diversity for both sessile and mobile species. This is mainly evident for commensal species sharing a facultative relationship with their host. Habitat complexity is enhanced by the architecture of biological structures, as well as by biological interactions. Colony morphology has a great influence on feeding efficiency for suspension feeders. Suspension feeding, habitat‐forming organisms modify the environment to optimize their food uptake. This environmental advantage is also passed on to associated filter‐feeding species. These effects are poorly understood but represent key points for understanding ecosystems and biodiversity on continental margins. In this paper we explore the contributions of organisms and the biotic structures they create (rather than physical modifications) to habitat heterogeneity and diversity on the deep continental margins.","We acknowledge the COMARGE project of the Census of Marine Life and the Total Foundation for supporting an international workshop in 2008 on margin diversity that led to the development of this paper, and for supporting production of a special volume devoted to heterogeneity–diversity relationships on continental margins.

The vertical distributions of the metanauplii and adult females suggest that N. couchi liberates its young within the euphotic zone as mature metanauplii which, in a matter of hours, moult into the first feeding stage (Calyptopis I). The ascent migration by adult females took a maximum of 3 h (17.10 to 20.05 hrs) and had an amplitude of ∼50m (54 to 4 m) from below to above the thermocline. A ∼7C° thermocline occurred between 20 to 30 m in these profiles. The nocturnal migrations by the females were for the purpose of breeding as well as feeding within the euphotic zone and were not influenced by the presence of the thermocline. The majority of the calyptopes and furciliae remained above the thermocline over the sampling period. The post-larval males and females migrated; their vertical distributions showed a pattern similar to those of the adult females. The larger the developmental stage, the deeper was the mode of its vertical distribution. The zooplankton dry weight in the profiles ranged from 3.74 to 6.91 g per haul (=1.85 to 3.45 g C m-2, 0 to 100 m). The euphausiids represented ∼35% of total zooplankton dry weight and their migrations removed a large percentage of the total zooplankton biomass from the euphotic zone for ∼18 h d-1. Such a large displacement of biomass would have a major impact on the biological interactions within the ecosystem.",,,Marine Biology,,Springer Nature,"0025-3162, 1432-1793",,1985-11,1985,,1985-11,89,3,257-262,Closed,Article,"Williams, R.; Fragopoulu, N.","Williams, R.

To assess the effects of climate warming on bivalve-seagrass interactions, we carried out a pioneering field experiment in which open top chambers (OTCs) were used to increase air and sediment temperature in a shellfish bed in NW Spain during two consecutive spring tides (16 days of exposure to OTCs). The temperature increase produced by OTCs was significant, as observed in the daily maximum and mean temperature and in degree hours, although the difference was greater in air and at the sediment surface (up to 8 °C and 3 °C, respectively) than at 5 cm depth (up to 1 °C). Warming was less acute in boxes with the seagrass Zostera noltei, which acted as a thermal buffer, reducing the mean temperature by 1 °C at the sediment surface in OTC boxes and control boxes (without OTCs). Although the short-term increase in temperature did not greatly affect physiological responses of Z. noltei, the carbohydrate reserves and nutrient content increased in the presence of clams. Growth of the native clam Ruditapes decussatus was significantly slower in OTC boxes with bare sediment, and the seagrass thus buffered the negative effect of warming on growth. The presence of Z. noltei may save clams from having to spend energy to burrow deeper to encounter cooler conditions, leaving more energy available for growth. Conversely, growth of the introduced clam R. philippinarum did not differ between habitats or treatments. Our findings confirm a two-way facilitative interaction that may be particularly important in relation to the resilience of both species in the current context of global warming.","This research was supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación/Agencia Estatal de Investigación (10.13039/501100011033) for the ZEUS project (grant RTI2018-095583-B-I00) and by the Autonomous government Xunta de Galicia-FEDER (project ED431C 2021/42): “ERDF A way of making Europe”.

However, trait selection and measurement are usually not standardized between studies, even for groups that have been widely studied, such as the Drosophilidae (Diptera). In order to suggest a standardized framework for trait selection and measurement for the Drosophilidae, here we reviewed the literature published between September 2018 and June 2021. The review returned 52 relevant papers, and based on the traits presented, we organized three categories of functional traits which we suggest need to be analyzed in order to understand functional pattern of the Drosophilidae: habitat perception, flight performance, and ecophysiological responses. Habitat perception includes those traits that provide the ability to recognize an environment and access its available resources. Flight performance includes those traits related to flight and mobility, while ecophysiological responses include those traits related to energy allocation, survival, and reproductive efficiency. Based on these categories, we projected the expected results for a broad application of the traits we selected in studies with Drosophilidae in natural environments, for example, using the functional approach for a comprehensive diagnosis of the relationship between Drosophilidae and their environments. We encourage a wide use of our framework for both basic and applied studies of Drosophilidae, particularly for those that seek to test hypotheses regarding community structure.","The authors would like to thank Dr Maria João Ramos Pereira, Dr Cristiano Agra Iserhard and Dr Marlúcia Martins for their intellectual contributions and comments.

However, there has not been systematic evidence from a landscape ecology perspective about the evolution of research in this field as well as the main gaps in knowledge.ObjectivesOur objective was to track the advancement of research on ecological impacts of LC by identifying the main topics, as well as emerging trends, primary findings and main impacts of LC in a Chilean biodiversity hotspot.MethodsWe used CiteSpace to conduct a bibliometric analysis to represent the knowledge domain and to identify scientific literature related to the impacts of LC in a Chilean biodiversity hotspot between 1990 and 2019.ResultsWe found that articles most frequently focused on compositional attributes of biodiversity (41%) and on analyzing impacts at the community (43%) and population level (34%). In particular, changes in community structure and composition and biologic interactions were the most frequently studied. Research on quantifying forest loss and fragmentation using spatially explicit modeling techniques over a long temporal scale were a turning point in LC impact research. We found several gaps in LC research, including lack of studies that simultaneously address multiple levels of the ecological hierarchy and that address linkages between ecological processes and the provisioning ecosystem services.ConclusionsStudies that address the impacts of LC at multiple levels of ecological hierarchies and on ecosystem processes and services are needed. Furthermore, our findings highlight the importance of place-based research syntheses to identify research gaps and meet sustainability goals.",This research was supported by the “Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico” Fondecyt regular 1181374.,,Landscape Ecology,,Springer Nature,"0921-2973, 1572-9761",,2021-04-28,2021,2021-04-28,2021-06,36,6,1587-1603,Closed,Article,"Hernández, Camilo; Echeverría, Cristian; Nelson, Cara","Hernández, Camilo (Laboratorio de Ecología de Paisaje, Facultad de Ciencias Forestales, Universidad de Concepción, Victoria 631, Concepción, Chile); Echeverría, Cristian (Laboratorio de Ecología de Paisaje, Facultad de Ciencias Forestales, Universidad de Concepción, Victoria 631, Concepción, Chile; Millennium Nucleus Center for the Socioeconomic Impact of Environmental Policies (CESIEP), Santiago, Chile); Nelson, Cara (Department of Ecosystem and Conservation Sciences, W.A.

Many studies have been done on the effects of grazing intensity and grazer species on arthropods in grassland ecosystems, but the information on the effects of grazing timing and frequency are less available. We investigated the abundance of ground-dwelling arthropods in spring, summer and autumn in an experimental steppe grassland that had experienced four grazing management (no-grazed control (T0), June-and-August grazing (T1), July-and-September grazing (T2) and plant growing season grazing (T3)) over four years in central Inner Mongolia. We found that (i) Phytophagous, parasitic and detritivore arthropods were more abundant in autumn than spring, whereas predatory and omnivorous arthropods were less abundant in autumn than spring and summer. (ii) Grazing reduced the abundance of detritivore or predatory arthropods, but not that of omnivorous arthropods. (iii) Grazing had no effects on the relative abundance of different arthropod guilds in spring, but T2 and T3 reduced the relative abundance of detritivore or predatory arthropods, but increased that of omnivorous arthropods in summer. (iv) The variations in the abundance of arthropod guilds was closely associated with the changes in vegetation attributes induced by current-year grazing (height, standing biomass and quality), not by grazing over multiple years (relative biomass of dominant plant species, soil available N and total C:N ratio). Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms of the biological interactions across tropic levels under different management and is helpful to the development of management regimes for steppe ecosystem conservation.","We thank Haiyan Chen, Baihui Hao, and Zhimin Yang for field and lab assistance.

551,pub.1128293267,10.1007/s13199-020-00687-8,,,,New insights into fungal diversity associated with Megaplatypus mutatus: gut mycobiota,"The ambrosial forest pest Megaplatypus mutatus causes high economic losses in Argentina and has been classified as an emerging pest in Europe. The high diversity of susceptible tree-species (native and non-native) and its wide geographical distribution turn this ambrosial beetle into a serious threat to forest plantations. This work aimed to characterise the fungal communities associated with M. mutatus` gut, compare the current results with previous culture-dependent and independent datasets and test the specificity of the fungal communities among adults, larvae and host-plants. A total of 2200 fungal strains were isolated by culture method from Males, Females and Larvae from Populus deltoides, grouping them into eleven fungal taxa. Additionally, the larval gut was studied by culture-independent method (454-pyrosequencing) analysing P. deltoides and Casuarina cunninghamiana. The Principal Component Analyses showed a separation between fungal species within adults and larvae, strongly suggesting that males and Graphium basitruncatum association would be even more specific than previously reported. The use of complementary culture-methods, integrated into different scales of study, reflected an important biological complexity in the studied interaction, showing that the specificity in the Fungi-M. mutatus association is given by key-fungal members such as Fusarium solani species complex, Candida insectalens, G. basitruncatum and Raffaelea spp. The multitrophic interactions between M. mutatus and gut-associated fungi were assessed for the first time. These results complement the data from culture methods previously reported, thus improving the accuracy and understanding of the fungal assemblages associated with M. mutatus.",The helpful comments made by the anonymous reviewers are gratefully acknowledged.

551,pub.1121828706,10.1016/j.seares.2019.101809,,,,Post-settlement movement as response to interspecific competition between the bioengineer mussels Semimytilus algosus and Perumytilus purpuratus,"Post-settlement movement has been reported mainly in marine species with low or reduced adult mobility, where distribution varies in accordance with ontogeny, thus avoiding or reducing environmental stress or biological interactions. Mussels show high dispersal at the larval stage, and settlement is a highly complex process in which larvae must choose an appropriate site to attach. Although adults are mainly sedentary, it has been shown that they move on a local scale during the benthic phase in response to physical and biological factors. Semimytilus algosus and Perumytilus purpuratus are two bioengineer mussel species cohabiting most of the Chilean rocky shores. While S. algosus occurs in the low intertidal zone, P. purpuratus dominates the mid and mid-high zones. Field and laboratory experiments have shown that S. algosus is a weak competitor with respect to P. purpuratus, and post-settlers present high mobility to relocate in the intertidal. Under this scenario, we evaluated the dispersal behavior of juveniles and adults of S. algosus as a potential response to competition with P. purpuratus. We also measured the attachment strength of S. algosus in the presence of its competitor, as a measure of its escape response ability. Our results showed that the presence of P. purpuratus increased the movement activity of juveniles and adults of S. algosus and decreased their attachment strength. Field experiments carried out with marked individuals in a Chilean rocky shore, showed that S. algosus exhibits higher local dispersion in the zone where P. purpuratus is present. Mussels' high dispersal ability throughout the whole benthic phase may not only serve to reach the optimal physiological position in the intertidal, but also to reduce competition interaction.",AB is grateful for the financial support from FONDECYT grants 1130868 and 1170598.,,Journal of Sea Research,,Elsevier,"1385-1101, 1873-1414",,2019-12,2019,,2019-12,154,,101809,Closed,Article,"Brante, Antonio; Riera, Rodrigo; Cartes, Verónica","Brante, Antonio (Departamento de Ecología, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Católica de la Santísima Concepción (UCSC), Concepción, Chile; Centro de Investigación en Biodiversidad y Ambientes Sustentables (CIBAS), UCSC, Concepción, Chile); Riera, Rodrigo (Departamento de Ecología, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Católica de la Santísima Concepción (UCSC), Concepción, Chile); Cartes, Verónica (Departamento de Ecología, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Católica de la Santísima Concepción (UCSC), Concepción, Chile)","Brante, Antonio (Catholic University of the Most Holy Conception; Catholic University of the Most Holy Conception)","Brante, Antonio (Catholic University of the Most Holy Conception; Catholic University of the Most Holy Conception); Riera, Rodrigo (Catholic University of the Most Holy Conception); Cartes, Verónica (Catholic University of the Most Holy Conception)",Catholic University of the Most Holy Conception,grid.412876.e,Concepción,,Chile,Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo,,Chile,grant.9278215,1130868,5,5,,1.2,3,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1121828706,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,
551,pub.1072518985,10.4322/actalb.02203001,,,,Determinants of beta diversity: the relative importance of environmental and spatial processes in structuring phytoplankton communities in an Amazonian floodplain,"AIM: Beta diversity is defined as the change in species composition along environmental gradients, and in the present study, we investigated the influence of local (i.e., environmental) and regional (i.e., dispersal) factors in community structure. The aims of this study were to evaluate the beta diversity of phytoplankton communities in the Curuaí floodplain and to determine the relative importance of environmental and spatial processes in shaping phytoplankton community structure; METHOD: The phytoplankton communities were sampled in 16 lakes of the Curuaí floodplain (Amazon Basin) during high-water periods in 2002 and 2003. We used partial redundancy analysis (pRDA) to evaluate the pure effect of environmental (six variables) and spatial (spatial filter) variability on phytoplankton community composition; RESULTS: There were 156 taxa recorded in the two study years, including 122 algae species in 2002 and 66 algae species in 2003. The beta diversity that we measured (βSIM index) was 0.889 in 2002 and 0.789 in 2003. The partitioning variation demonstrated that the majority of variation in phytoplankton community structure was not significantly explained by pure environmental and pure spatial components. However, environmental variables presented a larger coefficient of determination than the spatial variable; CONCLUSION: Other factors than those we measured in this study, such as local variables (i.e., biotic interactions, hydrology, etc.) and stochastic events, affected the absence of significant results in our data. Therefore, we suggest that additional variables, such as biological interactions and other local factors, should be considered in this type of analysis to increase its explanatory power for understanding the variation of diversity in these communities.","This study was funded by the HiBAm Program of IRD, the French Research Development Institute and ANA (Brazilian Water Agency), in a joint cooperation agreement between IRD and CNPq (Brazil).

551,pub.1049958738,10.1007/bf00026762,,,,Recruitment and year-to-year variability in a population of Macoma balthica (L.),"Because of methodological problems, macrobenthic studies usually neglect the juvenile stages of invertebrate communities, due to the fact that appearance of recruits in samples is only detected some weeks or even months after their true recruitment. During this period, the temporary meiobenthos undergoes high rates of mortality. From year to year, juvenile survival rate is thus responsible for temporal patterns observed in adult population densities.The results presented here relate to the population dynamics of the tellinid bivalve Macoma balthica (L.). A study of temporary meiobenthos was conducted over two consecutive years in an intertidal Macoma-community located at the mouth of the Gironde Estuary in southwest France. Sampling of juvenile stages required short intervals (2 weeks) between successive samplings and a fine sieving mesh size (63 µm). Other population parameters, such as temporal patterns in density, reproductive cycle, and individual growth, were recorded.Recruitment processes showed a year-to-year variability, with regard to settlement density, settlement period, and survival rate. In 1983, recruitment was moderate and protracted over several months. Only one main recruitment period was detected in 1984, resulting in a high juvenile density. In a previous study (1977), by contrast, recruitment was almost non-existent.This variability is discussed as a function of climatic and sedimentological conditions which prevailed in the estuary throughout the study period. However, none of these physical factors appeared to underlie the recruitment fluctuation in Macoma balthica. It is suggested that biological interactions are of prime importance in regulating population densities in this community.",,,Hydrobiologia,,Springer Nature,"1037-0544, 1573-8590, 0018-8158, 1573-5117",,1986-11-01,1986,1986-11-01,1986-11,142,1,233-248,Closed,Article,"Bachelet, Guy","Bachelet, Guy (Institut de Biologie Marine, Université de Bordeaux I, 2, rue du Professeur Jolyet, 33120, Arcachon, France)",,"Bachelet, Guy (University of Bordeaux)",University of Bordeaux,grid.412041.2,Bordeaux,,France,,,,,,32,1,,,6,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1049958738,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,

Even the baseline data on their distributions are lacking. Here the geographical distributions of two Mesobuthus scorpions in China are provided through a combined study of systematic field surveys and GIS-based ecological niche modeling using 227 surveyed point occurrence data across an area of ca. 2800 1700 km2 and validated historical records. Mesobuthus martensii (Karsch 1879) appears to be restricted to latitude south of 43N and the north side of the Yangtze River, bordered by the Helan Mountains and the Tengger and Mo Us sand desert in the west and limited by the sea in the east. Mesobuthus eupeus (C.L. Koch 1839) reaches the east side of the Helan Mountains and the west edge of the Loess Plateau, extending westward along the northern slope of the Qilian Mountains and ultimately penetrating to the northern part of the Junggar Basin. The former is mainly found in semi-humid and humid regions while the latter is an arid and semi-arid dweller. The two species show a parapatric distribution on the whole with a contact zone formed at the boundary of their ranges across the big turning of the Yellow River in the central-western part of Inner Mongolia, Ningxia and the middle part of the Gansu Province. This pattern of distribution is shaped both by the fundamental ecological niche constraint of the species and possibly by the biological interactions between the two species. Some diagnostic features for the two species are also provided for quick identification.","We would like to thank the following friends, schoolmates and colleagues for their assistance with various aspects of field survey: Jia Chen, Hongqiang Dong, Yujun Dong, Tinggui Feng, Ruidong Han, Ruicai Huo, Yajie Ji, Junlin Kang, Jun Lei, Jiyuan Li, Huatao Liu, Fei Lu, Yudi Liu, Chengjun L, Jiancang Ma, Conghai Tang, Lijuan Tang, Duohong Wang, Junping Wang, Ronghua Wang, En Wu, Yuchun Wu, Yongfeng Xu, Ruisheng Yang, Bowei Zhang, Deyi Zhang, Rui Zhang, Xincheng Zhao, Guangjian Zhu.

A total of 307 individuals was collected in the Uruguayan continental shelf, covering the four seasons of the year. Pelagic, demersal and first-year ring otolith measurements and otolith border type characteristics are taken into account. The growth that occurred between the time of hatching and the first-year was different for individuals collected in different seasons. Summer season was found to have the smallest averages (p<0.05) for pelagic, demersal and first-year rings. Different spawning times and variability in the environmental features throughout the year could affect the growth characteristics of M. hubbsi juveniles. Juveniles from autumn to winter spawning would mark their first-year in the following winter and would take longer to get to each of the analyzed rings. However, juveniles from spring spawning also mark the first-year in the following winter but, would show shorter life periods related to otolith and rings developments. The demersal ring formation showed significant differences between autumn and spring. This ring indicated the change between pelagic and demersal habitat. The temporal variation in the upper mixed layer and thermocline development throughout the year could be the cause of differences in growth development and behavior. Our current understanding of mesoscale physical processes suggests that these changes associated with biological interactions may play an important role in juvenile recruitment. Further investigations of mesoscale physical processes are needed to confirm these hypotheses.","We thank MSc.

551,pub.1030400867,10.1007/s10682-016-9862-3,,,,Convergent evolution of intraguild predation in phytotelm-inhabiting mosquitoes,"Intraguild predation (IGP) is a type of biological interaction involving the killing and consuming of competing species that exploit similar and often limited resources. This phenomenon is widespread among a great variety of taxonomic groups and has already been reported for mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) larvae. Moreover, the larvae of certain mosquito species of the tribe Sabethini have evolved modified mouthparts ending in rigid apical structures signaling their capacity to be effective intraguild predators. We assumed that IGP confers a selective advantage under severe competitive conditions by both providing an immediate energetic gain and reducing potential competition. Because potential competition is likely to increase with decreasing habitat size, we hypothesized that the proportion of species with modified mouthparts would increase in smaller aquatic habitats. We tested this hypothesis by examining the mosquito species naturally associated with phytotelmata of decreasing sizes in French Guiana. We show that the degree of specialization in mosquito-phytotelm associations is high, suggesting a long coevolutive process. Indeed, short-term interaction experiments confirmed that species with modified mouthparts are able to prey upon similarly-sized intraguild prey and are, thus, effective intraguild predators. In addition, these species are larger and associated with smaller phytotelmata than those with typical mouthparts. Moreover, below a certain threshold of phytotelm size, only species with modified mouthparts were present. These results show that IGP confers a selective advantage under severe competitive conditions and results from the coadaptation of mosquito species to their specific phytotelm habitat. The presence of functionally analogous structures in different mosquito genera also implies that IGP has emerged from convergent evolution in small phytotelmata.","We are grateful to Pascal Petronelli for identifying the phytotelm plant species, as well as to Hector Rodriguez, Marceau Minot and Clémence Mouza for field assistance.

Field surveys and manipulative experiments demonstrated that intraspecific density and sediment organic matter (SOM) content of sediments are among the factors that regulate the proportion of sand dollars that forage as deposit versus suspension feeders. High local density was associated with a lower proportion of deposit feeding animals in both field surveys and under controlled experimental conditions. Conversely, the proportion of deposit feeders was elevated in treatments in which SOM levels were subsidized, regardless of local density. These data fit Levinton's model of resource limitation in relation to deposit-and suspension-feeding communities, and expand the list of biological processes regulated through density dependence. Analyses of carbon stable isotope ratios (δ13C) of sand dollars and their potential sources of primary production suggest individuals rely primarily on suspended particulate organic carbon (POC) or drift macroalgae. Sediment organic matter was not a substantial source of carbon for most individuals. There was a significant inverse relationship between size and δ13C values; smaller individuals depended to a greater extent on macroalgae. There was no consistent relationship between isotopic ratios, feeding mode and density, which may be due to the high mobility of the species, their ability to respond rapidly to changing environmental conditions and the dynamic nature of their habitat. Our results suggest that biological interactions influence feeding mode of this species. This is a complementary mechanism to those described previously, in which physical factors such as flow and lift/washout have been shown to regulate sand dollar positioning.","General support came from UC MEXUS (J.

However, ecological and evolutionary consequences of the interactions may depend on both spatial and temporal patterns of the interactions. In a forest metapopulation of Primula sieboldii E. Morren, an endangered clonal plant species, we measured between‐subpopulation patterns of seed sets and interactions with an influential flower consumer, a rove beetle, Eusphalerum bosatsu Watanabe, and a specific smut fungal pathogen, Urocystis tranzschelina (Lavrov) Zundel (Ustilaginales), for three years. Mean female fertility (seed set per flower) for individual subpopulations fluctuated moderately among years but was highly variable within each year among the five subpopulations studied. In two subpopulations, the impact of Eusphalerum beetle, was sufficiently large to result in almost complete failure in seed production over eight years including the three study and five previous preliminary observation years. In the two other subpopulations, seed set failure was caused by infection by the smut fungus. Infected capsules which constitute 10–30% of the capsules produced in the subpopulations were filled with ustilospores instead of seeds. In the subpopulation that escaped flower damage by Eusphalerum beetles and smut fungal infection, seed sets of both pin and thrum flowers were much higher than in the other subpopulations. The spatial restriction of individual antagonistic agents to a part of subpopulations suggest that dispersal of the agents, as well as the mode of spatial subdivision of the plant population would be important for determining the overall effects of antagonistic interactions on plant performances at the metapopulation level.",,,Population Ecology,,Wiley,"1438-3896, 1438-390X",,1996-12,1996,2018-11-29,1996-12,38,2,249-256,Closed,Article,"Washitani, Izumi; Okayama, Yasushi; Sato, Keiko; Takahashi, Hitomi; Ohgushi, Takayuki","Washitani, Izumi (Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Tsukuba, 305, Tsukuba, Japan); Okayama, Yasushi (Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Tsukuba, 305, Tsukuba, Japan); Sato, Keiko (Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Tsukuba, 305, Tsukuba, Japan); Takahashi, Hitomi (Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Tsukuba, 305, Tsukuba, Japan); Ohgushi, Takayuki (Institute of Low Temeprature Science, Hokkaido University, 060, Sapporo, Japan)","Washitani, Izumi (University of Tsukuba)","Washitani, Izumi (University of Tsukuba); Okayama, Yasushi (University of Tsukuba); Sato, Keiko (University of Tsukuba); Takahashi, Hitomi (University of Tsukuba); Ohgushi, Takayuki (Hokkaido University)",University of Tsukuba; Hokkaido University,grid.20515.33; grid.39158.36,Tsukuba; Sapporo,Ibaraki; Hokkaidô,Japan; Japan,,,,,,27,3,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028851722,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,A05 Biological Sciences,15 Life on Land
551,pub.1024327291,10.1139/f84-106,,,,Mixed-Species Yield-per-Recruitment Analyses Accounting for Technological Interactions,"Multipecies fishery assessment models may be divided into two general categories: those involving analyses of the trophic interdependence of species (biological interactions) and those addressing the question of co-occurrence in fishing gear (technological interactions). Certainly, both categories of interactions may occur simultaneously. Nevertheless, the latter class of models is probably adequate if major species of interest exhibit a high degree of mutually exclusive food resource partitioning, and interspecific competition for food is low. In this study, multispecies analogs of the Thompson–Bell yield-per-recruit model are developed for alternative situations in which species groups (assemblages) are exploited solely by one fishery, and when several fisheries (defined by gear type, seasonal changes in species mix, etc), exploit the same species concurrently and/or sequentially. Species included in the analyses are assumed to have negligible trophic dependence. Equilibrium fishery yields (in aggregate and for individual species) are computed as functions of standardized effort levels and retention characteristics of gear (e.g. mesh size). The multiple fishery model allows for variable harvest strategies with respect to gear selectivity and effort levels among component fisheries. Simultation output includes total and individual equilibrium species yields, exploitation rates, and mean fish weights in the catch for all fisheries combined, and each separately. Applications of the models are illustrated for mixed-species otter trawl fisheries exploiting primarily Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, haddock, Melanogrammus aeglefinus, yellowtail flounder, Limanda ferruginea, and winter flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus, in the Georges Bank region off the northeastern United States.

The study investigates the concordance of species assemblages between vascular plants and oribatid mites and soil chemical properties with special attention to the role of vegetation structure, i.e. tree, shrub and herbaceous cover, for biological components. Data were collected in a Mediterranean coastal Nature Reserve using sampling design based on random selection of plots with cover of stone pine (Pinus pinea L.) exceeding 15%. Agreement of distribution patterns was verified by Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient applied to pairs of matrices of plot scores by principal component analysis (plants, mites and soil) and the Mantel test. The feasible role of vegetation cover on plant and mite assemblages was tested by redundancy analysis (RDA). Significant correlations were found for biological assemblages, indicating congruent plant–mite compositional patterns. On the other hand, the hypothesis of concordance between biological communities and soil was rejected. Moreover, RDA showed that vegetation cover was a driver of both plant and oribatid mite assemblages. In particular, herbaceous cover proved to be a good proxy for the two biological communities investigated, with different taxa linked to forest clearings and to areas with denser tree cover. Our results indicate that soil features were not of primary importance for below-ground and above-ground community assemblages in the study area. In the light of our findings and ongoing threats in coastal areas, we recommend that management measures be directed at maintenance of diversified vegetation structure, which may ensure above-ground and below-ground biodiversity with diverse biological community assemblages.","The comments of two anonymous reviewers were greatly appreciated.

The focus of this study is the response of species to time of snowmelt and altitude in alpine areas and an examination of changes in species response to snowmelt as altitude increases and temperature decreases. Transects (n= 43) were placed evenly along an altitudinal gradient at Finse, Hardanger‐vidda, western Norway, from ridges to late snowbeds. These gradients were systematically sampled (‘Repeated Gradient Analysis, RGA’) and an adjusted F‐test was used to determine repeated trends in species distribution along the transects. Of the 41 taxa analysed 22 showed a significant change in expected occurrence in response to time of snowmelt (when a site becomes free of snow) as altitude increased. Three types of response were observed: (1) no change in response: (2) increased occurrence as altitude increases, i.e. the taxon invades snow‐free sites as altitude increases, and (3) decreased occurrence as altitude increases, i.e. the taxon retreats from snow covered areas. It is suggested that the changes in response are due to both environmental factors (temperature related) and biological interactions. Decreases in expected occurrence are probably due to increased environmental severity as altitude increases (temperature related decreases). These species are represented by taxa preferring intermediate cover of snow. The invasion of earlier snow‐free sites is probably due to reduced competition from lee‐side taxa as altitude increases. A predictive model based on the species‐environmental relationships suggests that a 1°K temperature increase changes the limits of occurrence in response to time of snowmelt from 3 to 20 days for the different taxa.",,,Journal of Vegetation Science,,Wiley,"1100-9233, 1654-1103",,2002-02-24,2002,2002-02-24,2002-08,13,4,493-504,Closed,Article,"Heegaard, Einar","Heegaard, Einar (Botanical Institute, University of Bergen, Allégaten 41, N‐5007 Bergen, Norway; E‐mail einar.heegaard@bot.uib.no)",,"Heegaard, Einar (University of Bergen)",University of Bergen,grid.7914.b,Bergen,Hordaland,Norway,,,,,,62,8,,4.24,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1013389603,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,A05 Biological Sciences,

Here we examine kin interactions of Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (interior Douglas-fir) both in the context of pure kin stands, in accordance with established plant kin selection and recognition studies, but also in combination with inter and intraspecific neighbors in order to observe how interactions may differ in a more complex system. Seedlings grown with kin neighbors (i.e., in stands that contained only kin) were significantly larger (biomass, height, and root length) than those grown with any type of unrelated neighbor. However, of those with an unrelated neighbor, performance was better if that neighbor was interspecific (lodgepole pine rather than a stranger, or non-kin, Douglas-fir neighbor). Interestingly when Douglas-fir was grown in mixed stands, the four growth and four morphological traits of the seedlings examined paralleled neither pure stranger nor pure kin stands. This suggests that a mixed stand environment yielded cues that were uniquely different than either type of pure stand and that these seedlings are able to integrate that information and respond in a different way; for example, with increased early mycorrhizal fungal colonization. The morphological traits fine: coarse root allocation and slenderness (height relative to diameter) closely paralleled the seeding-size results, with the greatest values in pure kin stands. Whereas, fine root: needle allocation showed a kin response of less fine root allocation relative to needle mass compared to strangers, but kin seedlings had more fine root allocation when grown with a pine compared to a stranger Douglas-fir neighbor. We have demonstrated that the kin response in Douglas-fir is influenced by the complexity of the environment in which it grows, and this has significant effects on growth, morphology and mycorrhizal fungal colonization that may affect the success and resiliency of regeneration.","We thank Dr. Sally Aitken for valuable guidance and advice in designing the experiment and the analysis of the data.

Glaciers are known to harbor surprisingly complex ecosystems. On their surface, distinct cylindrical holes filled with meltwater and sediments are considered hot spots for microbial life. The present paper addresses possible biological interactions within the community of prokaryotic cyanobacteria and eukaryotic microalgae (microalgae) and relations to their potential grazers, such as tardigrades and rotifers, additional to their environmental controls. Svalbard glaciers with substantial allochthonous input of material from local sources reveal high microalgal densities. Small valley glaciers with high sediment coverages and high impact of birds show high biomasses and support a high biological diversity. Invertebrate grazer densities do not show any significant negative correlation with microalgal abundances but rather a positive correlation with eukaryotic microalgae. Shared environmental preferences and a positive effect of grazing are the proposed mechanisms to explain these correlations. Most microalgae found in this study form colonies (< 10 cells, or > 25 µm), which may protect them against invertebrate grazing. This finding rather indicates grazing as a positive control on eukaryotic microalgae by nutrient recycling. Density differences between the eukaryotic microalgae and prokaryotic cyanobacteria and their high distinction in redundancy (RDA) and principal component (PCA) analyses indicate that these two groups are in strong contrast. Eukaryotic microalgae occurred mainly in unstable cryoconite holes with high sediment loads, high N : P ratios, and a high impact of nutrient input by bird guano, as a proxy for nutrients. In these environments autochthonous nitrogen fixation appears to be negligible. Selective wind transport of Oscillatoriales via soil and dust particles is proposed to explain their dominance in cryoconites further away from the glacier margins. We propose that, for the studied glaciers, nutrient levels related to recycling of limiting nutrients are the main factor driving variation in the community structure of microalgae and grazers.","The field and lab work in the Czech Republic and on Svalbard was funded by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic through (1) CzechPolar – Czech polar stations, construction and logistic expenses (LM2010009) and (2) the project “Establishing of working team and conditions for education in the field of polar ecology and life in extreme environments” (no.

523,pub.1127503124,10.1016/j.jembe.2020.151382,,,,Lack of biotic resistance to an invasive bivalve irrespective of season or hydrodynamic disturbance,"Coastal ecosystems are subject to a wide variety of abiotic variation including seasonal fluctuations and hydrodynamic disturbance, which can influence species distributions. Additionally, introductions of invasive species are creating biotic pressures within coastal ecosystems, which can influence biological interactions. With the recent development of combining comparative functional responses, prey switching and biotic resistance theory in invasion ecology, invasion success and ecological impacts of invaders can be better quantified. Further, the incorporation of environmental contexts with these approaches allows predictions of invader success under a range of ecological scenarios. We examined the functional responses and prey switching propensities of the native European green crab, Carcinus maenas (Linnaeus, 1758), towards native blue mussels, Mytilus edulis (Linnaeus, 1758), and invasive Pacific oysters, Crassostrea (Magallana) gigas (Thunberg, 1793), under the abiotic contexts of season (winter vs summer) and hydrodynamic disturbance level (high vs low). In general, when each prey species was offered separately, C. maenas maximum feeding rates were higher towards native M. edulis compared to invasive C. gigas. In addition, handling times were lower, and thus maximum feeding rates were higher, in summer compared to winter. Hydrodynamic disturbance level had no significant influence on handling times or maximum feeding rates towards either prey species. When prey species were offered simultaneously, C. maenas disproportionately consumed native M. edulis over invasive C. gigas irrespective of proportional availability. In addition, increased hydrodynamic disturbance further increased the disproportionate consumption of M. edulis over C. gigas. We thus demonstrate that C. maenas offers little biotic resistance to invasions of C. gigas under a range of abiotic contexts, and indeed some of these contexts may exacerbate the invasion. We suggest that combined functional response and prey switching studies provide a wealth of information regarding invasion success and biotic resistance towards invasive species under environmental variation.","This work was funded by the Department for the Economy, Northern Ireland and part of SuperGen Marine Energy Research Consortium II, which was funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Science Research Council.

Canadian Pacific, Arctic and Atlantic Oceans from the intertidal zone to upper bathyal depths, encompassing 13 marine ecoregions. We compiled 35 benthic datasets that encompass 3,337 taxa (70% identified to species and 21% to genus) from 13,172 samples spanning 6,117 sites. Partitioning the analyses by different gear types, ecoregions or sites, we used Hill numbers to examine spatial patterns in α‐diversity. We used resampling and extrapolation to standardized sampling effort and examined the effects of depth, latitude, chemical energy (export particulate organic carbon [POC] flux), thermal energy (bottom temperature) and seasonality of primary production on the benthic biodiversity. The Canadian Arctic harboured the highest benthic diversity (e.g. epifauna and common and dominant infauna species), whereas the lowest diversity was found in the Atlantic. The Puget Trough (Pacific), Beaufort Sea, Arctic Archipelago, Hudson Bay, Northern Labrador and Southern Grand Bank (Atlantic) were the “hotspots"" of diversity among the ecoregions. The infauna and epifauna both exhibited hump‐shaped diversity–depth relationships, with peak diversity near shelf breaks; latitude (positively) predicted infaunal diversity, albeit weakly. Food supply, as inferred from primary production and depth, was more important than thermal energy in controlling diversity patterns. Limitations with respect to calculating POC flux in coastal (e.g. terrestrial runoff) and ice‐covered regions or biological interactions may explain the negative POC flux–infaunal diversity relationship. We show previously unreported diversity hotspots in the Canadian Arctic and in other ecoregions. Our analyses reveal potential controlling mechanisms of large‐scale benthic biodiversity patterns in Canada's three oceans, which are inconsistent with the prevailing view of seafloor energy–diversity relationships. These results provide insightful information for conservation that can help to implement further MPA networks.","This study was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Canadian Healthy Oceans Network.

523,pub.1047488550,10.1002/rrr.3450020204,,,,Instream flow studies in perspective,"The Instream Flow Incremental Methodology (IFIM) has been subject to criticisms, including its apparent imprecision, inability to predict discharge‐biomass relationships, lack of independence of hydraulic variables, and omission of predation/competition as variables in assessing the dynamics of aquatic populations and communities. This paper addresses criticisms of the methodology, stressing three themes. First, the development of IFIM to its present form is described. The goal of the method is to relate biotic values in equivalent terms to those used to estimate other beneficial uses of water. As such the engineering concepts of hydraulic simulation and suitability criteria play a strong role in the model. Previous studies suggest that IFIM appears to perform defensibly in coldwater systems but less well in more complex coolwater and warmwater systems. Second, the strengths of IFIM are considered and the type of environmental of IFIM are considered and the type of environmental problems it is suited to address are described. Research suggests that biotic responses vary dramatically as certain threshold discharges are approached and it is suggested that biomass predictions are inappropriate with current versions of IFIM. Its greatest utility is shown to be in assessing the impacts of water resources development on habitat availability for aquatic organisms. Third, the limitations of IFIM are presented; those that appear to have merit and those that arise from misapplication or misunderstanding of the methodology. We suggest that suitability criteria be developed on a site specific basis and include depth‐velocity dependent functions. The added predictive power by incorporation of coefficients of biological interactions to this management model is probably not justified by the expense required to obtain the data. As a tool, IFIM maximizes generality and precision at the expense of ecological reality but this does not detract from its utility to analyse water resource issues.",,,Regulated Rivers Research & Management,,Wiley,"0886-9375, 1099-1646",,1988-04,1988,2006-10-12,1988-04,2,2,93-101,Closed,Article,"Gore, James A.; Nestler, John M.","Gore, James A.

523,pub.1042803125,10.4490/algae.2002.17.1.041,,,,Patterns of Interactions among Neighbor species in a High Intertidal Algal Community,"Three dominant rocky intertidal macroalgae, the fucoids Fucus gardneri and Pelvetiopsis limitata (Phaeophyta) and the red alga Mazzaella cornucopiae (= Iridaea cornucopiae) on the west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada were used in a series of field experiments to examine interspecific interactions. These experiments showed complex patterns which included an interchange of negative (inhibition) and positive (facilitation) interactions depending on neighbor distance. Less fucoid recruitment occurred in the plots with greater percent cover of a turfforming red alga, M. cornucopiae. However, experimentally removing Mazzaella turf (the turf was considered to be ""blocking"" fucoid recruits or ""shading"" growing recruits) did not increase recruitment. This result indicated that there may be another factor(s) involved in the survivorship of juvenile fucoids in the turf-removed plots. Morphological differences in adult plants between Mazzaella and the two fucoids resulted in another type of interaction; these began when fucoids successfully settled and grew nearby or within the red algal turf. By monitoring microhabitat at the individual plant level for two years, I found that survivorship of fucoid recruits showed different species-specific patterns. The patterns also varied as the microhabitat changed from Mazzaella turf edge to open space. For F. gardneri, longevity of P.limitata at all distances tested was similar. A reason for greater longevity of F. gardneri individuals at edge microhabitats may be that these sites have one side open to light and nutrients and another site that buffers them from desiccation and wave impact. In the Mazzaella-Fucus interaction, neighbor distance was a key factor in determining whether the outcome of the interaction would be competition or facilitation (or protection). This study provides experimental evidence that detectable biological interactions occur in this upper intertidal algal community where physical conditions are usually severe, and also indicates the importance of small scale examination in understanding macroalgal interactions in intertidal habitats.",,,Algae,,The Korean Society of Phycology,"1226-2617, 2093-0860",,2002-03-31,2002,,2002-03-31,17,1,41-51,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Kim, Jeong-Ha","Kim, Jeong-Ha ()",,"Kim, Jeong-Ha ()",,,,,,,,,,,5,0,,0.38,,https://www.e-algae.org/upload/pdf/algae-2002-17-1-041.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1042803125,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3108 Plant Biology,,,,,,A05 Biological Sciences,
523,pub.1040923537,10.1111/ecog.00722,,,,Novel spatial analysis methods reveal scale‐dependent spread and infer limiting factors of invasion by Sahara mustard,"Multiple scale‐dependent ecological processes influence species distributions. Uncovering these drivers of dynamic range boundaries can provide fundamental ecological insights and vital knowledge for species management. We develop a transferable methodology that uses widely available data and tools to determine critical scales in range expansion and to infer dominating scale‐dependent forces that influence spread. We divide a focal geographic region into different sized square cells, representing different spatial scales. We then used herbarium records to determine the species' occupancy of cells at each spatial scale. We calculated the growth in cell occupancy across scales to infer the scale dependent expansion rate. This is the first time such a ‘box‐counting’ method is used to study range expansion. We coupled this multi‐scale analysis with species distribution models to determine the range and spatial scales where suitable climate allows the species to spread, and where other factors may be influencing the expansion. We demonstrate our methodology by assessing the spread of invasive Sahara mustard in North America. We detect critical scales where its spread is limited (100–500 km) or unconstrained (5–50 km) by climatic variables. Using climate‐based models to assess the similarity of climate envelopes in its native and invaded range, we find that the climate in the invaded range generally predicts the native distribution, suggesting that either there has been little local adaptation to climate occurring since introduction or the biological interaction experienced in the invaded range has not driven the species to occupy climatic conditions much different from its native range. Our novel method can be broadly utilized in other studies to generate critical insights into the scale dependency of different ecological drivers that influence the spread and distribution limits, as well as to help parameterizing predictions of future spread, and thus inform management decisions.","John Donoghue II, Irena Simova and Jin Wu guided us to cross the mysterious terrain of ArcGIS.

523,pub.1045504828,10.1666/07008.1,,,,The Red Queen revisited: reevaluating the age selectivity of Phanerozoic marine genus extinctions,"Extinction risk is inversely related to genus age (time since first appearance) in most intervals of the Phanerozoic marine fossil record, in apparent contradiction to the macroevolutionary Red Queen's Hypothesis, which posits that extinction risk is independent of taxon age. Age-dependent increases in the mean species richness and geographic range of genera have been invoked to reconcile this genus-level observation with the presumed prevalence of Red Queen dynamics at the species level. Here we test these explanations with data from the Paleobiology Database. Multiple logistic regression demonstrates that the association of extinction risk with genus age is not adequately explained by species richness or geographic range: there is a residual association between age and extinction risk even when range and richness effects are accounted for. Throughout most of the Phanerozoic the age selectivity gradient is highest among the youngest age cohorts, whereas there is no association between age and extinction risk among older age cohorts. Some of the apparent age selectivity of extinction in the global fauna is attributable to differences in extinction rate among taxonomic groups, but extinction risk declines with genus age even within most taxonomic orders. Notable exceptions to this pattern include the Cambrian-Ordovician, latest Permian, Triassic, and Paleocene intervals. The association of age with extinction risk could reflect sampling heterogeneity or taxonomic practice more than biological reality, but at present it is difficult to evaluate or correct for such biases. Alternatively, the pattern may reflect consistent extinction selectivity on some as-yet unidentified covariate of genus age. Although this latter explanation is not compatible with a Red Queen model if most genus extinctions have resulted from biological interactions, it may be applicable if most genus extinctions have instead been caused by recurrent physical disturbances that repeatedly impose similar selective pressures.","We would like to thank C.

This study modeled the succession populations of two barnacle species, Tetraclita stalactifera (Lamarck, 1818) and Chthamalus bisinuatus (Pilsbry, 1916), and a bivalve, Brachidontes solisianus (d’Orbigny, 1846), on a sandstone reef at Piedade Beach, Pernambuco State, Brazil. The different stages of the life cycles of these invertebrates are represented by adult and immature forms in this model and are simulated as numbers of individuals per 100 cm2. Recruitment rates are represented as forcing functions based on field recruitment experiments with time-steps of 1 day. In addition to intraspecific competition, the model takes into account interspecific competition based on reciprocal effects and carrying capacities. Field data from field succession experiments were used to calibrate the model. Recruitment and succession data were collected from random 10 × 10-cm plots within a 1-m transect on a Brachidontes bed from April to December 2007. Correlation coefficients between field data and simulation results were statistically significant for both populations; sensitivity analysis showed that increases and decreases in invertebrate population densities were always smaller than 10% compared to baseline model values. Patch closure by mussels population growth was one of the main succession processes observed during the rainy season. However, barnacles were the dominant species at the end of both field and simulation succession experiments, with an average density of close to 100 individuals per 100 cm2. Cirripedia individuals may inhibit bivalve re-colonization by settling over shells and more efficiently occupying free space in addition to having higher recruitment rates than bivalves during the dry season.","This work received financial support from the Brazil National Research Council (CNPq) and Facepe (Pernambuco State Research Foundation), grant numbers APQ.0129.2.05/06 and 470424/2007-9.",,Hydrobiologia,,Springer Nature,"1037-0544, 1573-5117, 0018-8158",,2010-10-07,2010,2010-10-07,2011-01,658,1,365-372,Closed,Article,"de Guimaraens, Mariana Alves; de Araújo Luz, Betty Rose; Félix da Silva, Janilson; Sá Carneiro, Jessica Pires","de Guimaraens, Mariana Alves (Departamento de Biologia, Instituto de Ciências Biológicas (ICB), Universidade de Pernambuco, Rua Arnóbio Marques, 310, Santo Amaro, 50100-130, Recife, PE, Brazil); de Araújo Luz, Betty Rose (Departamento de Biologia, Instituto de Ciências Biológicas (ICB), Universidade de Pernambuco, Rua Arnóbio Marques, 310, Santo Amaro, 50100-130, Recife, PE, Brazil); Félix da Silva, Janilson (Departamento de Bioquímica, Centro de Ciências Biológicas (CCB), Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Av.

The European common periwinkle, Littorina littorea, was recently introduced to the Pacific coast of Canada and provides a case study of an introduction into an area with an important predator guild (sea stars) that is functionally minor in the invader’s native habitat. Here, we assess the likelihood of establishment, spread, and negative ecological impact of this introduced gastropod, with an emphasis on the role of native sea stars as agents of biotic resistance. Size frequency distributions and local market availability suggest that L. littorea was most likely introduced via the live seafood trade. Non-native hitchhikers (e.g., the trematode Cryptocotyle lingua) were found on/in both market and field specimens. Laboratory studies and field observations confirmed that L. littorea can survive seasonal low salinity in Vancouver, British Columbia. Periwinkles also readily consumed native Ulva, suggesting that periwinkles could impact native communities via herbivory or resource competition. Unlike native gastropods, however, L. littorea lacked behavioural avoidance responses to Northeast Pacific predatory sea stars (Pisaster ochraceus and Pycnopodia helianthoides), and sea star predation rates on L. littorea were much higher than predation rates on native turban snails (Chlorostoma funebralis) in common garden experiments. We therefore expect periwinkle establishment in British Columbia to be limited to areas with low predator density, as is seen in its field distribution to date. We caution that this conclusion may understate the importance of the L. littorea introduction if it also serves as a vector for additional non-indigenous species such as C. lingua.","We thank D. Reid for assisting with the identification of the snails. R. Gooding brought the L. littorea population at Acadia Beach to our attention.

At many coastal sites, barnacles are abundant as epibionts on the shells of mussels. As they approach the shore, cypris larvae explore the environment, actively seeking suitable settlement sites and rejecting unsuitable substrata. Suitability involves micro-features of the surface, including its texture and contours, chemical signals and the presence of conspecifics. To investigate whether epibiosis on mussel shells indicates a preference for this substratum on the part of the barnacle Chthamalus dentatus, artificial plates were deployed at two rocky shore sites on the south coast of South Africa. These plates offered settling cyprids four habitat choices: a live mussel, the shell of a recently dead mussel, a fine resolution resin replica of a mussel shell to mimic architectural micro-surface, without the chemical characteristics of natural shells and a rock mimic, a surface covered in a film of hard plastic that resembled natural rock surface as closely as possible. Settling surfaces were photographed monthly, and new barnacles were counted and allocated to size classes, so that survival could be estimated over a period of several months. Barnacles showed a clear preference for the rock mimic surfaces, which on average supported double the number of settlers found on mussel replicas. These in turn were significantly higher than the numbers on live and dead mussel shell surfaces, implying that there are features of both dead and live mussel shells that deter barnacle settlement. In contrast, final abundances of adults showed no significant effect of settling surface. The results suggest that during settlement, cyprids avoid chemical cues from mussel shells that persist even after the death of the mussel. This suggests that the high numbers of barnacles often found on the surface of live mussels could be due to saturation of substratum.",This work is based upon research supported by the South African Research Chairs Initiative of the Department of Science and Technology and the National Research Foundation [SS].,,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology,,Elsevier,"0022-0981, 1879-1697",,2015-12,2015,,2015-12,473,,195-201,Closed,Article,"Bell, Caroline; McQuaid, Christopher D.; Porri, Francesca","Bell, Caroline (Coastal Research Group, Department of Zoology and Entomology, Rhodes University, P.O.

We examined the relationship between arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) root colonization, nematode populations, and plant competition in an 8-year-old field experiment comparing alfalfa monoculture to dual culture of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and Russian wildrye (Psathyostachys juncea Fisch. Nevski) (RWR) grown under different soil P fertility levels, in a Brown Chernozemic soil in Saskatchewan. The experiment included three P rates: 0, 20 and 40kg P2O5ha−1 (0P, 20P and 40P) applied annually and was sampled three times during the cropping season: 30 June, 1 September and 30 September. Higher AM symbiotic development compensated for reduced soil P fertility in alfalfa stands without RWR and forage dry matter yield was not affected by P rates. But in the presence of RWR, reduced soil P fertility at 0P and 20P led to forage yield reduction. Fertilization treatments modified the soil microbial community structure only in the presence of RWR, as revealed by discriminant analysis of the profiles of microbial phospholipids fatty acid in soil lipid extracts and functional nematode groups. Arbuscular mycorrhizal root colonization level was reduced with P fertilizer both in the presence and absence of RWR. In the presence of RWR, lower plant AM root colonization was concurrent with higher abundance of total, fungivorous and omnivorous nematodes. Our results are consistent with a model of negative feedback from the plant-associated soil microflora where the presence of RWR increased the population of fungivorous nematodes and grazing of AM hyphae. Negative impacts were larger in low P fertility soils promoting AM symbiotic development. The unexpected decrease in alfalfa–RWR dual culture yield under 0P and 20P fertilization levels was attributed to a carbon drain created by enhanced nematode feeding on AM fungi in the presence of RWR.",,,Applied Soil Ecology,,Elsevier,"0929-1393, 1873-0272",,2008-09,2008,,2008-09,40,1,30-36,Closed,Article,"Atul-Nayyar; Hamel, C.; Forge, T.; Selles, F.; Jefferson, P.G.; Hanson, K.; Germida, J.","Atul-Nayyar (Semiarid Prairie Agricultural Research Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, P.O.

In order to determine the reason for the difference in temporal stability of fish assemblage structures in a continuous habitat site and an isolated habitat site, population dynamics and spatial distributions of coral reef fishes (six species of pomacentrids and two species of apogonids) in the two habitat site were investigated over a 2-year period in an Okinawan coral reef. The population densities of pomacentrid and apogonid species increased in juvenile settlement periods at both sites, but the magnitude of seasonal fluctuation in population density was significantly greater at the isolated habitat site, indicating that the rate of juvenile settlement and mortality rate in the isolated habitat were greater than those in the continuous habitat. The magnitude of aggregation of fishes, which affects density-dependent biological interactions that modify population density such as competition and predation, was also significantly greater at the isolated habitat site, especially in the juvenile settlement season. Most of the fishes at the isolated habitat site exhibited more generalized patterns of microhabitat selection because of less coral coverage and diversity. The seasonal stability in the species composition of fishes was greater at the continuous habitat site than that at the isolated habitat. Our findings suggest that the relative importance of various ecological factors responsible for regulation of the population density of coral reef fishes (e.g., competition, predation, microhabitat selection and post-settlement movement) in a continuous habitat site and the isolated habitat site are different.",,,Environmental Biology of Fishes,,Springer Nature,"0378-1909, 1573-5133",,2003-10,2003,,2003-10,68,2,101-112,Closed,Article,"Nanami, Atsushi; Nishihira, Moritaka","Nanami, Atsushi (Biological Institute, Graduate School of Science, Tohoku University, 980-8578, Sendai, Japan); Nishihira, Moritaka (Biological Institute, Graduate School of Science, Tohoku University, 980-8578, Sendai, Japan)",,"Nanami, Atsushi (Tohoku University); Nishihira, Moritaka (Tohoku University)",Tohoku University,grid.69566.3a,Sendai,,Japan,,,,,,17,3,,1.17,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1029497121,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,

We review our studies on recent production trends, marine carrying capacity, climate effects and biological interactions between wild and hatchery origin populations of Pacific salmon in the open sea, with a particular focus on Japanese chum salmon (O. keta). Salmon catch data indicates that the abundance of Pacific salmon increased since the 1976/77 ocean regime shift. Chum and pink salmon (O. gorbuscha) maintained high abundances with a sharp increase in hatchery-released populations since the late 1980s. Since the 1990s, the biomass contribution of hatchery returns to the total catch amounts to 50% for chum salmon, more than 10% for pink salmon, and less than 10% for sockeye salmon (O. nerka). We show evidence of density-dependence of growth and survival at sea and how it might vary across spatial scales, and we provide some new information on foraging plasticity that may offer new insight into competitive interactions. The marine carrying capacity of these three species is synchronized with long-term patterns in climate change. At the present time, global warming has positively affected growth and survival of Hokkaido populations of chum salmon. In the future, however, global warming may decrease the marine carrying capacity and the area of suitable habitat for chum salmon in the North Pacific Ocean. We outline future challenges for salmon sustainable conservation management in Japan, and recommend fishery management reform to sustain the hatchery-supported salmon fishery while conserving natural spawning populations.","We would like to express our sincere thanks to David Noakes of the Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, Oregon Hatchery Research Center, Oregon State University, and Pete Rand of the State of the Salmon for their comments and encouragement on earlier draft of the paper.

In Baie des Veys (Lower Normandy, France), the common cockle Cerastoderma edule constitutes the major bioturbator in the ecosystem in terms of biomass. In this ecosystem, cockle bioturbation is a key process regulating the MPB erosion flux in the water column. This bivalve intensely modifies the top layer of the sediment by increasing the sediment erodibility and the fluxes of suspended chlorophyll a through the valve movements. More precisely, cockle bioturbation destabilizes the sediment surface by creating a biogenic layer that is easily eroded with tidal hydrodynamic forces. Associated MPB can then be exported to the water column to fuel higher trophic levels of the planktonic food web. The aim of this study was to develop a numerical model that reproduces the export of MPB associated to the biogenic layer erosion. Kinetics of suspended MPB, in response to increasing stress, were obtained from flume experiments in lab controlled conditions and in situ natural conditions. Following this, the suspended MPB were analyzed to respectively parameterize the model by (1) a calibration approach, and (2) an independent validation. The analysis has highlighted that the higher the biomass of cockles, the higher the MPB resuspension rates. Our model consistently reproduces the tendency encountered in laboratory analysis and with in situ natural conditions. During the validation, a small site-specific lack of adjustment was identified, but, among the macrozoobenthic community, the model can be significantly improved by considering the bioturbation activities of another ecosystem engineer, Pygospio elegans. This study thus provides reliable estimates of the daily food availability from benthic primary consumers in an estuarine system where cockles dominate the bioturbating assemblage. This model can be inserted in various model designs (0D, 1D-vertical or 3D).","This study was funded by the Regional Council of Lower Normandy (Conseil Général de Basse Normandie) and the Water Agency Seine Normandy (Agence de l’Eau Seine Normandie).

However, meiofaunal organisms have been largely ignored in turtle shell studies despite their omnipresence and higher abundances and diversity than the macrofauna. Epifauna from the hawksbill sea turtle Eretmochelys imbricata was investigated during summer 2010 with the aim to advance our knowledge on meiofaunal epibiont communities on turtle carapaces and gain insights into their interaction with settled macrofauna. Eighteen epibiont higher taxa were found (17 meiofauna, 5 macrofauna), 5 of which are common for macro- and meiofauna. Meiofauna was present on all turtle carapaces, but macrofauna occurred on only 8 out of 19 investigated carapaces, suggesting that carapace colonization by meiofauna precedes macrofauna recruitment. In addition, the macrofauna embedded on the carapaces increased the microhabitat complexity, favoring richer and more abundant meiofauna communities. The significant positive correlations between meiofauna and macrofauna taxa (up to 90 %) suggests the presence of mutual facilitating processes and indicates the positive effects between meio- and macrofaunal epibionts important for their recruitment and establishment. The hawksbill sea turtle carapaces were occupied by fully functional and active epifaunal communities, with adult and reproductive stages for most meiofaunal and macrofaunal taxa. Turtle carapaces can therefore be seen as a biological substrate that can serve as a platform for faunal dispersal, as has been observed for barnacles, enhancing the geographical distribution of several species through sea turtle migration. In addition to the main focus of this paper on meio- and macrofaunal epibiont communities, we provide an updated list of taxa found on carapaces of the hawksbill sea turtle and discuss the geographical scope and dispersion potential of some of these taxa.","This work was financially supported by FACEPE (Fundação de Amparo a Ciência e Tecnologia) grant (IBPG-0027-2.04/10) to the first author and by Federal University of Pernambuco for the laboratory support and the ONG Ecoassociados for the essential help in the field.

The effects of environmental and biological parameters on the distribution of these species were evaluated by generalized additive modelling (GAM). In 2017, the dominant ctenophore, Bolinopsis infundibulum, was mainly distributed in the north and west of St. Lawrence Island (SLI), and their vertical distribution varied with the region but not by the time of day. We found that B. infundibulum was distributed in the upper pycnocline north of SLI, but below the pycnocline west of SLI. Biological interactions with other gelatinous zooplankton may explain these regional differences in vertical distribution; GAM analysis revealed a negative interaction between B. infundibulum and the large scyphomedusa, Chrysaora melanaster, which occurred in the upper layer in the west of SLI. B. infundibulum may avoid that layer to reduce feeding competition. For the ctenophore, Beroe sp., vertical and horizontal distributions were similar to those of B. infundibulum, and GAM analysis also revealed a positive interaction for both species. As B. infundibulum is an important prey of Beroe sp., a prey-predator interaction may result from their similar horizontal and vertical distributions. Standing stocks of epipelagic ctenophores and scyphomedusae in 2018 were low compared to those in 2017, by a factor of 1/20 (C. melanaster) and1/90 (Beroe sp.). This might be due to annual differences in water mass in this region, in that the thermal conditions characterized by a high abundance of the dominant B. infundibulum in 2017 (<2 and >8 °C) were absent in 2018.

There are, however, several constraints to consider throughout much of the Pacific, including, transport problems, fragile ecosystems, lack of suitable sites, limited economies, and the effects of customary marine tenure on access to growout sites. To overcome these problems, coastal aquaculture in the Pacific will need to focus either on species of high value, or those that yield non-perishable products. Valuable industries have been established for pearl oysters, penaeid shrimps, and the microalgae, Spirulina, in tropical Australia, the French territories and Hawaii, whereas enterprises for cultured giant clams, milkfish (Chanos chanos) as tuna bait, the macroalgae, Eucheuma, and sponges are emerging in the small island developing states. Species demanded by the aquarium trade, groupers for live reef fish markets, tropical abalone (Haliotidae), mangrove crabs (Scylla spp.) and a variety of invertebrates as sources of bioactive compounds are promising new species for intensive farming. Aquaculture technology is being applied to the restocking and stock enhancement of valuable, sedentary species low in the food chain, and there are active programmes in several small island developing states to assess the scope for releasing cultured giant clams, trochus, green snail and sea cucumbers to replenish and enhance wild stocks. There is a growing awareness that the potential benefits of increased aquaculture, restocking and stock enhancement need to be balanced by the risks associated with culturing additional species, i.e. introduction of diseases, dilution of gene pools and increased biological interactions with other species, and that sustainable aquaculture, restocking and stock enhancement are most likely to be achieved with responsible application of technology and the use of indigenous species.",,,Aquaculture International,,Springer Nature,"0967-6120, 1573-143X",,1999-07,1999,,1999-07,7,4,207-223,Closed,Article,"Bell, J.D.; Gervis, M.","Bell, J.D.

523,pub.1036373460,10.1890/13-1455.1,,,,An exotic herbivorous insect drives the evolution of resistance in the exotic perennial herb Solidago altissima,"Invasive plants often experience rapid changes in biological interactions by escaping from their original herbivores at their new habitats, and sometimes re‐associating with those herbivores afterwards. However, little is known about whether the temporal changes in herbivorous impact work as a selective agent for defensive traits of invaded plants. Solidago altissima (goldenrod) is a North American perennial that has widely invaded abandoned fields in Japan. Recently, an herbivorous insect Corythucha marmorata (lace bug), an exotic insect also from North America, which was first recorded in 2000 in Japan, has been expanding its habitat on S. altissima populations in Japan. In this study, we investigated whether the invasion of C. marmorata had a selective impact on the defensive traits of S. altissima, by conducting a field survey, a common garden experiment and microsatellite analysis. We compared quantitative genetic differentiation of traits (resistance, growth, and reproduction) and neutral molecular differentiation among 16 S. altissima populations with different establishment years of C. marmorata. The common garden experiment, in which plants were grown in a greenhouse and treated to either C. marmorata herbivory or no herbivory, revealed the presence of higher resistance, sexual reproduction, and asexual (rhizome) reproduction in populations subjected to a longer history of C. marmorata pressure. Such phenotypic variability among establishment years of lace bugs was likely driven by natural selection rather than stochastic events such as genetic drift and founder effects. In addition, when plants were exposed to lace bug herbivory, resistance had a positive relationship with sexual and asexual reproduction, although no relationship was found when plants were free from herbivory. These findings suggest that defensive traits in S. altissima have evolved locally in the last decade in response to the selective pressure of C. marmorata.","We thank M. Tokuda, K. Matsukura, K.

523,pub.1018983032,10.1890/es14-00389.1,,,,Integral projection models show exotic thistle is more limited than native thistle by ambient competition and herbivory,"Both competitors and natural enemies can limit plant population growth. However, demographic comparisons of the effects of these interactions on introduced versus co‐occurring, related native species are uncommon. We asked: (1) does plant competition, insect herbivory, or their combination reduce population growth rate, log λ, of the Eurasian thistle Cirsium vulgare sufficiently to explain its limited invasiveness in western tallgrass prairie; and (2) how do the effects of these interactions compare to those for C. altissimum, its co‐occurring, synchronously‐flowering native congener? We developed integral projection models (IPMs) to estimate log λ for both species, using parameter estimates from field experiments. Our models predicted that the growth potential (growth rate at minimal competition and herbivory) for the introduced thistle (log λ = 3.5 (2.5, 4.6)) was twice as large as for the native thistle (log λ = 1.6 (0.4, 3.1)); however, a high level of competition and ambient insect herbivory together reduced log λ to similar values for both thistle species (C. vulgare: log λ = −1.3 (−2.4, −0.3) vs C. altissimum: log λ = −0.9 (−1.4, −0.3)). This suggests that the introduced thistle was more affected by competition and insect herbivory. For the introduced thistle, neither competition nor insect herbivory alone led to negative log λ. In contrast, for the native thistle, high competition alone also led to negative population growth (log λ = −0.8, percentile limits do not overlap with zero). Ambient herbivory alone prevented the spread for both thistle species (percentile limits include zero). Overall, the results show that interspecific competition followed by ambient levels of insect herbivory strongly constrained log λ for both thistles, limiting C. vulgare invasiveness and C. altissimum abundance. The outcome highlights the importance of synergy between the two biological interactions in limiting plant population growth. Improved understanding of mechanisms limiting log λ for weedy plants enhances our ability to predict when biotic resistance will contribute to invasive plant species management.","We thank B.

523,pub.1010549647,10.1007/bf00006228,,,,Disturbance and organization of macroalgal assemblages in the Northwest Atlantic,"Large seaweeds are often structurally dominant in subtidal and intertidal rocky shore benthic communities of the N.W. Atlantic. The mechanisms by which these algal assemblages are maintained are surprisingly different in the two habitats. In the subtidal community, kelps are dominant space competitors in the absence of strong grazing interactions. In contrast, the large perennial seaweeds of intertidal zones (fucoids and Chondrus crispus) are competitively inferior to both sessile filter feeders and ephemeral, pioneer algal species. Intertidal seaweed beds are maintained by carnivory of whelks, which reduces filter feeder populations, and by herbivorous periwinkles which reduce ephemeral algal populations. Through most of the intertidal zone, disturbance, both biological and physical, dictates which species shall compete and equilibrium conditions obtain subsequently.The roles of subtidal consumers are quite different. Sea urchins are the major algal herbivores and these voracious animals maintain an equilibrium state in which large tracts of subtidal coralline pavement are kept free of kelp forests. Urchins do not seem to play a successional facilitative role for kelps in the way that periwinkles do for fucoids in the intertidal. Control of herbivore populations is thus a key to the maintenance of subtidal foliose algal beds. It is clear that parasitic amoebas can decimate sea urchin populations so that kelp forest dominance is assured. However, the importance of carnivory in limiting urchins in the subtidal community is unclear in the absence of appropriate manipulation experiments. It is possible that carnivorous decapods and fin fish control sea urchin populations and hence foliose algal abundance, but this must remain speculative. The seaweed-dominated state of the subtidal system is an alternative equilibrium condition to the urchin/coralline alga configuration. The structure of the kelp beds is relatively uniform in responding to frequent small-scale, infrequent large-scale, or no, disturbance.",,,Hydrobiologia,,Springer Nature,"1037-0544, 1573-5117, 0018-8158",,1990-03,1990,,1990-03,192,1,77-121,Closed,Article,"Chapman, A.

523,pub.1153017071,10.1111/jbi.14531,,,,In both directions: Expansions of European land snails to the north and south from glacial refugia,"Were postglacial recolonizations facilitated by persistence close to the colonized areas rather than by dispersal ability allowing for colonization from distant sources? This question is particularly relevant for organisms with low active dispersal abilities and lacking specialized propagules. Here we identified glacial refugia of four Central European land snail species, including one for which a northern glacial refugium in the region was indicated by indirectly dated fossils. Central Europe and the Balkans. Pulmonate land snails: Monachoides incarnatus (Hygromiidae) and Helix pomatia, Helix thessalica and Caucasotachea vindobonensis (Helicidae). We used continuous phylogeographic analysis of mitochondrial sequence data to trace the origin of postglacially expanding lineages. We assessed the credibility of results from our focal species, M. incarnatus, by comparison to three other broadly sympatric land snail species. In addition, we performed direct radiocarbon dating of fossil shells to verify the presumed glacial presence of M. incarnatus on the territories of Czechia and Slovakia and to test the reliability of the available fossil data. In three of the four species, the molecular data supported refugia located south of the Pannonian Basin, from the south‐eastern Alps to the south‐western Carpathians, but not more northerly. The direct radiocarbon dating resulted in younger dates than previously assumed. However, the molecular data also revealed unexpected, yet substantial postglacial southward expansions of M. incarnatus and C. vindobonensis into the Balkans. Neither the phylogeographic analyses nor the direct radiocarbon dating provided evidence for the glacial survival of studied land snail species in Central Europe. The refugia located adjacent to the Pannonian Basin were the most important source of postglacial expansions to Central Europe, but were also the source of the expansion southwards. Both climatic factors and biological interactions might explain why such southward expansions seem rather rare in Europe.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This study was supported by the Grant Agency of Charles University (GAUK) project no. 244120 (awarded to T.A.).

Here, combining a cross‐biome observational study with an experimental microcosm study, we provided evidence to reveal the major roles of biotic factors (i.e., soil fungi and cross‐kingdom species associations) in determining soil bacterial biogeography and community assembly in complex terrestrial ecosystems of the arid regions of northwest China. The results showed that the soil fungal richness mediates the balance of assembly processes of bacterial communities, and stochastic assembly processes decreased with increasing fungal richness. Our results further suggest that the predicted increase in aridity conditions due to climate change will reduce bacterial α‐diversity, particularly in desert soils and subsurface layer, and induce more negative species associations. Together, our study represents a significant advance in linking soil fungi to the mechanisms underlying bacterial biogeographic patterns and community assembly in arid ecosystems under climate aridity and land‐use change scenarios. Our findings revealed the major roles of biotic factors and aridity in shaping the bacterial landscapes and mediating the community assembly in complex terrestrial ecosystems. Soil fungal richness mediates the balance of assembly processes of soil bacterial communities, with stochastic assembly processes decreasing along with an increase in fungal richness. Increased aridity conditions due to climate change could reduce the bacterial α‐diversity, with more negative effects in desert soils and subsurface layers, and induce more antagonistic or competitive biological interactions. Soil fungal richness mediates the bacterial community assembly. Stochastic assembly processes decreased with increasing fungal richness. Increase in aridity reduced bacterial α‐diversity.

523,pub.1085454497,10.1111/jvs.12546,,,,Dispersal‐driven homogenization of wetland vegetation revealed from local contributions to β‐diversity,"Within a meta‐community, what determines how local species composition differs from the regional community? How do local conditions and landscape context affect this differentiation in wetland vegetation? Fleurieu Peninsula, South Australia. We sampled native vegetation across 26 hydrological gradients in a wetland meta‐community within a heavily cleared agricultural landscape. We used the local contribution to β‐diversity to quantify how species composition at each site differed from the average across all sites. We hypothesized that local contribution to β‐diversity would respond to assembly processes (niche, biological interactions, dispersal) through effects on the species turnover and richness difference components of β‐diversity. We used beta regression to model local contribution to β‐diversity, building a candidate set of 55 models, each incorporating one of the assembly processes. We used standardized regression coefficients to measure effect size, and null models to explore diversity patterns further. While variations in among‐site niche dimensions were influential, the strongest control on local contribution to β‐diversity was a negative association with the number of wetlands within 200 m. Null models showed this was because common species were over‐represented in well‐connected sites within the meta‐community, while rare species were under‐represented. Our results demonstrate the homogenization of native plant species composition in well‐connected wetlands, consistent with theoretical predictions of declining β‐diversity when connectivity is high. We recommend comparative analysis of local species composition to regional average diversity to evaluate the role of wetland connectivity in homogenization of composition before conservation or restoration priorities are assigned. Well‐connected habitats are often rich in species diversity, but we found that connectivity can homogenise native plant communities. Local contributions to species gradients were lowest in wetlands with other wetlands close by, because common species were over‐represented at the expense of rare species (figure).

523,pub.1070956556,10.2989/025776198784126845,,,,Population dynamics and management implications of larval dispersal,"Strong advective fields in coastal shelf ecosystems, particularly in eastern boundary currents, lead to significant longshore dispersal of the larval phase of meroplanktonic benthic invertebrates. Field observations of larvae and settlement in the California Current by recent workers are an example of the increasing research on the biological/physical mechanisms underlying larval transport. In particular, these studies identify physical/biological interactions that control the spatial distribution of larvae settling successfully. The current study demonstrates how the results of such studies contribute to (1) better understanding of population dynamics, and (2) better population management, using the cyclic covariability in the Dungeness crab Cancer magister population as an example of the former and management of the red sea urchin Strongylocentrotus franciscanus population as an example of the latter. Earlier modelling studies have shown that dispersal influences the stability and synchrony of variability in metapopulations such as the Dungeness crab, and that the spatial scale of covariability is roughly the scale of dispersal. The mechanism identified by recent research implies that the spatial scale of dispersal should be the distance between promontories in the California Current, roughly 100–200 km. Analysis of covariability between time-series of recruitment at different locations along the coast confirm that this is the spatial scale of longshore variability in the Dungeness crab. The spatial pattern in red sea urchin settlement caused by the identified mechanism provides: (1) the basis for spatially explicit management, and (2) an explanation for the observed spatial variability in the degree of overfishing. Research on larval dispersal is also providing the information necessary to design spatially explicit management strategies involving either permanent or temporary fishery closures. Both population dynamics and management require further research to describe the origins of larvae and the early larval phase, in addition to the transport just before settlement.",,,South African Journal of Marine Science,,National Inquiry Services Center (NISC),0257-7615,,1998-06,1998,,1998-06,19,1,131-142,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Botsford, L.

523,pub.1046521204,10.1890/05-0479,,,,BIOTIC RESISTANCE TO INVASION: NATIVE PREDATOR LIMITS ABUNDANCE AND DISTRIBUTION OF AN INTRODUCED CRAB,"Introduced species frequently escape the natural enemies (predators, competitors, and parasites) that limit their distribution and abundance in the native range. This reduction in native predators, competitors, and parasites may result in ecological release in the introduced range. However, biological interactions also can limit the establishment and spread of nonnative populations. The extent to which such biotic resistance occurs is poorly resolved, especially for marine ecosystems. Here we test whether a native predator, the blue crab Callinectes sapidus, affects the abundance and geographic range of the introduced European green crab Carcinus maenas in eastern North America. Both crab species occur in shallow, soft‐sediment habitats of bays and estuaries, and their ranges overlap in eastern North America. First, we tested for a negative relationship in the abundances of the two species from trap samples across a 640‐km (5.78° latitude) coastal transect. Second, we estimated variation in predation pressure on tethered Carcinus maenas across latitude and as a function of Callinectes sapidus abundance. Third, we measured predation rates on Carcinus maenas by Callinectes sapidus in field and laboratory experiments. Our results support the hypothesis that the native predator Callinectes sapidus provides biotic resistance to invasion and prevents the southward spread and establishment of Carcinus maenas. Within and across bays, Carcinus maenas were significantly less abundant at sites and depths with Callinectes sapidus compared with areas lacking Callinectes sapidus. Moreover, no Carcinus maenas were found in Chesapeake Bay, where Callinectes sapidus were most abundant. Predation of tethered Carcinus maenas increased with Callinectes sapidus abundance. In laboratory and field experiments, Callinectes sapidus preyed readily on Carcinus maenas. Thus, we conclude the predation by Callinectes sapidus, alone or in combination with other factors, limits the abundance and geographic range of an invasive marine species.","We thank T. Fenner, K.

For many such assessments, predictions of entire communities are preferred. When entire community compositions are modelled, two options are available: (1) to model all of the communities’ species individually and (2) to incorporate community information into the models. Here, we compared the accuracy of these two modelling approaches for predicting boreal lake phytoplankton assemblages and their ability to detect human impact. The modelling approaches tested were specifically classification-then-modelling (here a RIVPACS-type model, using random forest to predict biological group membership) and species-by-species modelling, using a random forest model for each species. The species-by-species models performed better than the RIVPACS model according to the dissimilarity measure BC, the area under curve (AUC) and proportion of true positives. In contrast, the taxonomic completeness index (O/E), commonly used for freshwater assessments, indicated that the RIVPACS model performed better. However, we believe that O/E overestimates model performance, due to the index omitting false negative errors (i.e. errors where species are wrongly predicting as absent). No support was found for our hypothesis that rare species would be better modelled by the RIVPACS model. Indeed, the RIVPACS model predicted common species significantly better than the species-by-species models, whilst the species-by-species models predicted rare species better than the RIVPACS model. Both modelling methods were able to separate impaired sites (acidified and eutrophic) from reference sites. We suggest that classification-then-modelling is evaluated using data-set containing more possible biological interactions, e.g. phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish. We also suggest that AUC is used as a complement to taxonomic completeness when evaluating models for reference condition taxa composition.","We thank the many people involved in collecting and processing the physicochemical and phytoplankton samples.

They may be the key to coral reefs resilience, yet little is known about the pattern of larval subsidies from deeper to shallower coral reef habitats. Here we use a biophysical modeling approach to test the hypothesis that fishes from mesophotic coral reef ecosystems may replenish shallow reef populations. We aim at identifying the spatio-temporal patterns and underlying mechanisms of larval connections between Pulley Ridge, a mesophotic reef in the Gulf of Mexico hosting of a variety of shallow-water tropical fishes, and the Florida Keys reefs. A new three-dimensional (3D) polygon habitat module is developed for the open-source Connectivity Modeling System to simulate larval movement behavior of the bicolor damselfish, Stegastes partitus, in a realistic 3D representation of the coral reef habitat. Biological traits such as spawning periodicity, mortality, and vertical migration are also incorporated in the model. Virtual damselfish larvae are released daily from the Pulley Ridge at 80m depth over 60 lunar spawning cycles and tracked until settlement within a fine resolution (~900m) hydrodynamic model of the region. Such probabilistic simulations reveal mesophotic-shallow connections with large, yet sporadic pulses of larvae settling in the Florida Keys. Modal and spectral analyses on the spawning time of successful larvae, and on the position of the Florida Current front with respect to Pulley Ridge, demonstrate that specific physical-biological interactions modulate these “perfect storm” events. Indeed, the co-occurrence of (1) peak spawning with frontal features, and (2) cyclonic eddies with ontogenetic vertical migration, contribute to high settlement in the Florida Keys. This study demonstrates that mesophotic coral reef ecosystems can also serve as refugia for coral reef fish and suggests that they have a critical role in the resilience of shallow reef communities.","This paper is a result of research funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Center for Sponsored Coastal Ocean Research under award NA11NOS4780045 to the University of Miami.

523,pub.1033206924,10.1007/bf02414774,,,,Methods for biological monitoring: Biological interactions in communities of subtidal sediments,"Predation has been demonstrated to be of fundamental importance in structuring benthic communities in the intertidal zone. The aim of the present investigation was to elucidate some of the effects of predation on structuring communities in unvegetated subtidal sediments. Field manipulative cage experiments were performed on sediment in the inner part of the Oslofjord (Norway), where the species composition was typical for a moderately organically enriched sediment. Sediment from this area was transferred to an area not suspected a priori to be seriously affected by organic pollution, and the effect of predation on the fauna was evaluated. Predation effects were not observed in the Oslofjord experiments partially because of extensive obstruction of recruitment to the sediment by settlement ofPolydora antennata on the cage; however, further experiments are in progress in this area. No such settling was observed in the unpolluted area. Here 63 taxonomic groups were identified, 57 in the control and 50 in the cages; 43 taxonomic groups were found in both the cage and the control. The total number of individuals was significantly higher in the cage (4779) than in the control (2849). The fauna recruited to the sediment in the cage responded to decreased predation by macropredators by a significant reduction in diversity. Of the 10 most abundant groups 3 (Tellinacea, Syllidae andPholoë minuta) were significantly more abundant in the cage than in the control; 3 others (Prionospio malmgreni, Microphthalmus abberans and Paraonidea) were significantly more abundant in the control. It is concluded that in an unpolluted area predation is an important factor in controlling numbers of at least some of the most abundant species.

Classification of European lake fish assemblages can be based on fish‐assemblage structure or morphological, geographical, physical and chemical lake attributes. However, substantial gaps in knowledge exist with respect to the correspondence between both classification approaches. 2. Here, we compiled fish assemblage data from 165 lakes situated in the European ‘Central Plains’ ecoregion. Cluster analysis of fish abundances was performed to compare fish assemblage types of the entire ecoregion with those from previous country‐specific studies. Nonparametric group comparisons, classification trees and partial canonical ordinations were used to infer the correspondence between fish assemblage types and morphology, geographical position and nutrient concentration of the lakes. 3. Three distinct fish assemblages were revealed: vendace (Coregonus albula), ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus) and roach (Rutilus rutilus) lake types. Both latitude and lake depth were the best determinants of lake type, but total phosphorus (TP) concentrations were also important. Vendace lakes were deep and had low TP concentrations, whereas the shallower ruffe and roach lakes had higher TP values. Roach lakes were more frequent in the north‐west area of the ecoregion, whereas ruffe lakes were more often found south of the Baltic Sea. 4. Controlling for the influence of nutrient concentration showed that lake morphology and geographical position were important determinants of fish assemblages. However, the variance explained was low (<20%), implying that biological interactions may also be important in forming the lake‐specific fish assemblages. 5. The results suggest that fish assemblages differ between deep and shallow lakes, and between the north‐west and south‐east locations within the Central Plains ecoregion. Accordingly, establishment of depth‐related lake morphotypes is needed, and the European ecoregions recommended to be used in evaluation systems according to the Water Framework Directive seem to be too coarse to reflect the subtle differences of fish species richness along geographical gradients.","Fish sampling and data evaluation in Germany was financed by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF, grant nos 0330031 and 0330718).

523,pub.1091282105,10.1111/1365-2745.12851,,,,Environmental controls on the causes and functional consequences of tree species diversity,"Knowledge of the functional consequences of biodiversity is increasing through studies of both experimental systems and natural systems. Community assembly theory has also helped to reveal the causes of biodiversity organization. However, the causes and consequences of biodiversity have been discussed in parallel and simultaneous consideration of both has been limited, even though they are both influenced by regional environmental conditions. To understand the relationship between biodiversity and productivity, I focused on the linkages between the number of tree species and biomass productivity across forest biomes under a range of bioclimatic conditions. I found that high tree diversity generally increased productivity. This was primarily due to a selection process that results from a high probability of having high‐performance species and their dominance at high diversity, regardless of the biome. In less‐productive biomes, the residual importance of diversity, which likely reflects other forms of biological interactions (including species complementarity), increased productivity. These findings of differential diversity effects under different environmental conditions are consistent with the existing theory of community assembly, which predicts a shift in the assembly process from stochasticity to determinism with increasing environmental harshness. Analyses based on functional trait diversity also supported this theory: stochastic assembly (resulting in the selection effect) and deterministic assembly (possibly resulting from interspecific niche differences) became more important in productive and less‐productive biomes, respectively. Synthesis. Increasing our understanding of the causalities between diversity and other characteristics, such as productivity, is crucial, particularly for forest ecosystems, because of the increasing interest in productivity‐related ecosystem services supported by diverse assemblages of trees.

Hydroponics is an alternative method of plant nutrient supply which avoids soil-nutrient reaction complexities. Eucalyptus and related species are highly valued as fast-growing woody plants. We conducted a study to evaluate the feasibility of producing eucalypt seedlings hydroponically, and investigate if the seedling growth and morphology could be manipulated through regulated hydroponic nutrient supply. We focused on phosphorus nutrition since it is one of the commonly growth limiting plant nutrient element. Two important eucalypts species Eucalyptus dunnii and Corymbia citriodora were grown hydroponically in a greenhouse at six P concentrations (0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 2mM) for two months with 1/4 strength modified (different P concentrations) Hoagland solution in a glass greenhouse. Phosphorus nutrition significantly affected seedlings’ leaf area, height, stem diameter and biomass (p<0.0001). Seedlings of both species had optimal growth between 0.1mM and 1mM P concentrations, while the lowest (0 and 0.01mM P) and highest (2mM P) P concentrations resulted in stunted seedlings. The reduction in growth at the highest P concentration (2mM) was possibly caused by inorganic phosphorus (Pi) toxicity, micronutrient unavailability and uptake antagonism due to excessive P. There was a close relationship between the Hoagland solution P concentration, plant tissue P and nitrogen (N) concentration. Phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) was highest at lower (0.01mM) P concentrations (13gmM−1 for C. citriodora and 19 gmM−1 for E. dunniii). Low P concentration (0.1mM) was sufficient to produce good quality seedlings in both species. Our study confirmed that hydroponic system could be used successfully to produce high vigor woody plants seedlings. The eucalyptus seedlings had sufficient roots and shoot growth. The general root lengths for both species were more than 30cm long.","The authors also thank the staff at the University of Georgia, Department of horticulture woody ornamental plants and Plant Nutrition and Physiology labs.

523,pub.1024169625,10.1007/s10682-009-9339-8,,,,Interspecific interference competition alters habitat use patterns in two species of land snails,"Focus has been placed on the relative importance of environmental heterogeneity and biological interactions on community structure. For land snails, abiotic factors have commonly been assumed to be the most important factors for shaping communities because resources for land snails are commonly not limiting, and because interspecific resource competition would not be strong enough to promote ecological divergence. However, clear divergence in habitat use is often observed among sympatric land snail species. Such an ecological divergence would be promoted not by resource competition but by other interactions such as aggression. To test this hypothesis, laboratory experiments were designed to explore aggressive behaviour in the land snails Euhadra quaesita and E. peliomphala and field surveys were conducted to examine their habitat use. In the laboratory experiments, we examined how the presence of one species affects the growth of the other species by supplying sufficient amounts of food and calcium for both species. Experimental trials showed that adult E. quaesita decreased the growth of E. peliomphala under constant diet conditions. In contrast, E. peliomphala did not affect the growth of E. quaesita. Because E. peliomphala was often attacked by E. quaesita and its shell was often eroded by E. quaesita gnawing, aggression by E. quaesita appears to be the primary factor reducing the growth of E. peliomphala. When the two species coexist in nature, adults and juveniles of E. quaesita are terrestrial, while those of E. peliomphala are arboreal. When these species occurred alone, E. quaesita were still terrestrial, but E. peliomphala were more terrestrial than when they were in sympatry. Our results suggest that habitat use of these species in the natural communities is affected by interspecific interference. These findings further suggest that the divergence of habitat use between the species can occur by aggression even in environments with unlimited resources.","We express our sincere gratitude to M.

523,pub.1023985577,10.1111/aec.12159,,,,Riparian Plants Alter Aquatic Prey Supply,"Community structure and dynamics can be influenced by resource transfers between ecosystems, yet little is known about how boundary structure determines both the magnitude of exchanges and their effects on recipient and donor communities. Aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are often linked by resource fluxes and riparian vegetation is commonly affected by anthropogenic alterations to land use or river hydrological regime. I investigated whether shrubs at the freshwater–terrestrial interface alter the supply, distribution and importance of aquatic prey resources to terrestrial consumers. Shrubs were predicted to alter the larval community composition of aquatic insects and the emergence of winged adults, thus affecting aquatic prey subsidies to terrestrial consumers. In addition, shrubs were hypothesized to alter the microclimatic suitability of the riparian zone for adult aquatic insects, act as a physical barrier to their dispersal and affect terrestrial community composition, particularly the abundance and type of predators that could benefit from the aquatic prey resource. Stable isotope dietary analyses and a survey of shrub‐dominated and open grassland riparian habitats revealed that larval densities of aquatic insects (EPTM: Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Megaloptera) were higher in shrub than grassland habitats; however, reduced emergence and lateral dispersal in shrub areas led to lower densities of adults. The temperature and relative humidity of the riparian zone did not differ between the habitats. Ground‐active terrestrial invertebrate communities had a higher proportion of cursorial spiders in grassland, coinciding with greater abundances of aquatic prey. Aquatic prey contribution to cursorial spider diet matched adult aquatic insect abundances. Overall, riparian shrubs reduced the magnitude, or at least altered the timing, of cross‐ecosystem subsidy supply, distribution and use by consumers through mechanisms operating in both the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Thus, the structure of ecosystem boundaries has complex effects on the strength of biological interactions between adjacent systems.","Sophie Goodall, Laura Drummond and Steve Pawson provided field assistance.

523,pub.1004027077,10.1111/geb.12216,,,,Imperfect detection and survey bias in presence‐only data,"During the past decade ecologists have attempted to estimate the parameters of species distribution models by combining locations of species presence observed in opportunistic surveys with spatially referenced covariates of occurrence. Several statistical models have been proposed for the analysis of presence‐only data, but these models have largely ignored the effects of imperfect detection and survey bias. In this paper I describe a model‐based approach for the analysis of presence‐only data that accounts for errors in the detection of individuals and for biased selection of survey locations. I develop a hierarchical, statistical model that allows presence‐only data to be analysed in conjunction with data acquired independently in planned surveys. One component of the model specifies the spatial distribution of individuals within a bounded, geographic region as a realization of a spatial point process. A second component of the model specifies two kinds of observations, the detection of individuals encountered during opportunistic surveys and the detection of individuals encountered during planned surveys. Using mathematical proof and simulation‐based comparisons, I demonstrate that biases induced by errors in detection or biased selection of survey locations can be reduced or eliminated by using the hierarchical model to analyse presence‐only data in conjunction with counts observed in planned surveys. I show that a relatively small number of high‐quality data (from planned surveys) can be used to leverage the information in presence‐only observations, which usually have broad spatial coverage but may not be informative of both occurrence and detectability of individuals. Because a variety of sampling protocols can be used in planned surveys, this approach to the analysis of presence‐only data is widely applicable. In addition, since the point‐process model is formulated at the level of an individual, it can be extended to account for biological interactions between individuals and temporal changes in their spatial distributions.","Editorial suggestions from the editor, C.

Understanding the hazards of chemicals is essential to wise decision making, and it is now clear that community structure changes are closely linked to altered ecosystem function. Uncertainty is high when decisions are made from a small biological (toxicological) database. Individual bioassays provide little insight into biological interactions that are important in sustaining ecosystems. Artificial ecosystem experiments with herbicides demonstrate the limited predictive power of bioassays and ecological risk assessment methods that are heavily dependent on animal testing. Many herbicides interfere with unique pathways in photosynthetic organisms but are not very toxic to animals. For example, the herbicide atrazine is not considered toxic to fishes, because atrazine interferes with electron transport in photosystem II. But, adding atrazine at low levels (3–100 μg/L) to aquatic microcosms demonstrated significant increases in algal biomass, concurrent enhancement of nutrient recovery systems, and increases in the detectable number of heterotrophic microbial species. Higher levels of atrazine (100–300 μg/L) produced general collapse of these laboratory ecosystems. Low levels of atrazine capable of producing ecosystem‐level effects can occur from days to weeks in streams of midwestern agricultural areas. Conversely, the herbicide diquat is rapidly immobilized in the field if fine sediments are present. Laboratory bioassays tend to overestimate diquat toxicity if sediments are not present because the material rarely persists in the water column. A variety of measures of ecosystem condition are available for assessment of chemical effects. Community structure changes (especially of nontarget groups) and changes in ecosystem process variables have technical importance and are not assessed in current risk assessment paradigms. Regulators need to draw on a more comprehensive data set than is presently used to make risk assessment decisions. Sometimes, this may require using methods other than those considered standard for data development.",,,Ecological Applications,,Wiley,"1051-0761, 1939-5582",,1997-11-01,1997,1997-11-01,1997-11,7,4,1117-1124,Closed,Article,"Pratt, J.

Since then, the model has been expanded to capture the dynamics of numerous types of interacting populations and to include the effects of external factors from the environment. Despite many simplifying assumptions, the LV approach has proven to be a very valuable tool for gaining insights into the dynamics of diverse biological interaction systems. In particular, recognizing the critical importance of microbiomes for human and environmental heath, LV systems have become effective tools of analysis and, indeed, the default for quantitatively assessing interactions within these large microbial communities. Here we present an overview of parameter inference methods for LV systems, specifically addressing individuals entering the field of biomathematical modeling, who have a modest background in linear algebra and calculus. The methods include traditional local and global strategies, as well as a recently developed inference method based strictly on linear algebra. We compare the different strategies using both lab-acquired and synthetic time series data. We also address a recent debate within the scientific community of whether it is legitimate to compose large models from information inferred for the dynamics of subpopulations. In addition to parameter estimation methods, the overview includes preparatory aspects of the inference process, including data cleaning, smoothing, and the choice of an adequate loss function. Our comparisons demonstrate that traditional fitting strategies, such as gradient descent optimization and differential evolution, tend to yield low residuals but sometimes overfit noisy data and incur high computation costs. The linear-algebra-based method produces a satisfactory solution much faster, generally without overfitting, but requires the user to estimate slopes from the time series, which can introduce undue error. The results also suggest that composing large models from information regarding sub-models can be problematic. Overall, there is no clear “always-best method” for inferring parameters from data, and prudent combinations may be the best strategy.","The authors would also like to acknowledge members of the Voit and Brown labs for their valuable contributions to the manuscript, and the Partnership for Advanced Computing (PACE) at Georgia Tech for use of their computing nodes.","The authors acknowledge the following funding sources supporting this project: The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (BROWN19I0, BROWN21P0, DAVIS21H0), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (BAA 2016-N-17812, BAA 2017-OADS-01, 75D30120C-09782), the National Institutes of Health (1R21AI143296 and 1R21AI156817), and the Georgia Research Alliance.",Frontiers in Systems Biology,,Frontiers,2674-0702,,2022-10-26,2022,2022-10-26,,2,,1021897,All OA; Gold,Article,"Davis, Jacob D.; Olivença, Daniel V.; Brown, Sam P.; Voit, Eberhard O.","Davis, Jacob D.

This article documents the responses of water quality, plankton and macroinvertebrate communities to an eradication of the globally invasive common carp Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus 1758, using the piscicide rotenone in a small South African reservoir. Treated and untreated reservoirs were sampled before and at intervals following rotenone treatment. Sampling endpoints included water quality parameters, plankton, macroinvertebrates and fish. These endpoints were selected to gain an understanding of the ecological impacts of the treatment at various biological levels and to document possible recovery following treatment. The study showed that: (i) the common carp were successfully removed; (ii) water clarity improved following the removal of fish; (iii) invertebrate communities, including macroinvertebrates and large zooplankton, recovered within 6 months of treatment; and (iv) that small zooplankton (i.e. Rotifera) dynamics were complex but rotifer abundances had returned to pre‐treatment levels within 6 months of treatment. There was a 56% similarity between the macroinvertebrate assemblages before and 6 months after treatment, showing a substantial turnover in taxa following treatment. The phytoplankton community of the treated reservoir was dominated by blue‐green and green algae prior to the treatment. The blue‐green algal communities were not present 6 months after the treatment, possibly indicating a change in the nutrient status of the reservoir resulting from lower nutrient concentrations in the water column. The phytoplankton community of the reservoir changed from a community typical of eutrophic waters to a community typical of a lower nutrient state. Within each group, there were species changes, but we suggest these are likely to be part of the altered biological interaction dynamics resulting from fish removals, rather than a direct effect of rotenone.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We acknowledge the funding of the Water Research Commission Project K5‐2538 for funding the project.

However, the sharp increase in the use of DFADs leads to some ecological concerns, such as producing higher amount of by-catch or alteration of natural behaviour of fish. We used fishers’ satellite-linked GPS buoys equipped with echo-sounders to continuously collect acoustic samples under remote DFADs and investigate the diel behaviour patterns of the associated fish (i.e., non-tuna species and small and large tunas) and their potential biological interactions. Results showed a strong correlation between the presence of non-tuna species and small tunas, and between small and large tunas. Diel biomass dynamics were highly variable and seem to be both species and region-specific, which may suggest adaptive behaviour patterns. Tuna associated with DFADs in the Somalia area showed a clear night-time associative behaviour. In contrast, tuna in the NW Seychelles associated with DFADs to a greater degree during daytime. In the Mozambique Channel, large tuna showed daytime associative behaviour, while small tuna showed a maximum biomass at sunrise, decreasing over the day. The associative behaviour of non-tuna species was slightly variable, being uniform near the equator or showing two peaks when increasing latitude. This study shows the importance and effect of biological factors on the associative behaviour of the fish and serves as a first step towards improving pre-set selectivity of purse seine fisheries using DFADs. The fish presence and density may improve DFAD attraction and detectability and the observed periodicity by species and area shows both similarities and differences with published literature.","The authors would like to sincerely thank Spanish fishing masters of tuna purse seiners in the Indian Ocean who kindly agreed to deploy the echo-sounder buoys used in the present study.

On both beaches, samples were taken along five transects established perpendicular to the waterline. Parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth function were estimated for both populations from monthly length-frequency distributions. The production and turnover ratios were determined using the mass-specific growth rate method. The population on the less-sheltered Barequeçaba Beach was less abundant (120.02 ± 22.60 ind m−1) than on Pernambuco Beach (3295.30 ± 504.86 ind m−1 (±SE)), which we attribute to the greater environmental stability of the latter. Conversely, the mean length, size of the largest individual, and body mass were higher at Barequeçaba than at Pernambuco. The significant differences in the growth of individuals and the mortality rate (Z) between the beaches suggest that density-dependent processes were operating at Pernambuco Beach. The production and P/B ratio at Pernambuco (12.12 g AFDM m−1 year−1 and 1.91 year−1) were higher than at Barequeçaba (0.82 g AFDM m−1 year−1 and 1.06 year−1). The difference in production can be attributed to the higher abundance on Pernambuco, while the higher P/B ratio resulted from the scarcity of smaller individuals in the intertidal zone of Barequeçaba. The P/B ratio estimated for the Pernambuco population is the highest found so far for sandy-beach gastropods. This study reinforces the theory that biological interactions are important regulators of sheltered sandy-beach populations. Future studies with multi-beach sampling are needed to better understand the life-history variations of O. minuta along gradients of degree of exposure of sandy beaches.","This paper is part of the M.Sc. dissertation of R.M.

We sampled 30 sites as part of a project to determine the relationships between landscape features and the biological and chemical characteristics of headwater streams and their associated wetlands. In this paper we consider vegetation in wetlands adjacent to headwater streams. Calamagrostis canadensis was the only species that occurred at all sites and only a few species were widespread and abundant across the range of sites sampled. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling of species importance values indicated that the distribution of sites and species was primarily related to stream-reach scale environmental and biological factors. Sixteen stream-reach factors were significantly correlated with the distribution of sites and species on one axis of the ordination. Headwater streams that were located in relatively flat areas with extensive wetlands had species characteristic of nutrient poor wetlands and sites located in steep valleys with narrow wetlands had species characteristic of uplands and wetlands on mineral soils. The distribution of sites and species on the second ordination axis was interpreted to be a response to biological interactions; primarily the negative relationship between C. canadensis and the diversity of other species. We concluded that large-scale watershed features of the landscape are less important than local scale factors in determining the characteristics of vegetation in headwater stream-wetland complexes in the Kenai Lowlands. There was no evidence, however, that differences in the stream-reach scale conditions across the study sites resulted in distinct plant communities associated with the headwater wetlands even though the headwater streams had their origin in different landscape settings.","The project was funded through US EPA’s Wetland Program Development Grant program.

522,pub.1037350700,10.3825/ece.7.201,,,,Estimation of stream ecosystems by 13C and 15N natural abundances,"Stream restoration has been conducted in the Shibetsu River in northern Japan, which aims at the recovery of its river-floodplain ecosystem altered dramatically in the last 40 years. Well-designed monitoring before and after restoration should be conducted to evaluate the effects of the stream restoration on its ecosystem. An analysis of stable isotope ratios (δ-values) is one of the most effective methods for monitoring material cycling in river ecosystems. Because product δ-values are roughly dependent upon their source δ-values, we can trace material flows by comparing the δ-values of various compounds. In the first section of this review, we introduced a basic concept of the δ-value analysis by using an analogy from various diffusion patterns of salt water. The second section described how to calculate δ-values and discussed the difference between the analyses of natural stable isotope ratios and the tracer analyses (another powerful tool for material flow analysis). The third section presented the theoretical basis of mechanisms which change the δ-values. A product δ-value becomes different from its source δ-value in two kinds of processes: isotope exchange equilibrium and kinetic isotope fractionation. The magnitude of this difference (Δδ-value: δproduct-δsource) tells us about the processes and activities of the reactions. The fourth section introduced specific examples from the carbon and nitrogen δ-values (δ13C, δ15N) of aquatic organisms to infer the degree of eutrophication and carbon recycling at ecosystem levels as well as to determine food web structures and photosynthetic activities at biological interaction levels. In the fifth section, we presented the result of our study indicating differences in food web structure between a main-stream channel and oxbow lake in the Shibetsu River watershed when their δ13C and δ15N values of diverse aquatic organisms were compared. The advantages and limitations of the stable isotope analysis in environmental assessment were also discussed.",,,Ecology and Civil Engineering,,Ecology and Civil Engineering Society,"1882-5974, 1344-3755",,2005,2005,,2005,7,2,201,All OA; Bronze,Article,"KOHZU, Ayato; KAWAGUCHI, Yôichi; NUNOKAWA, Masanori; NAKAMURA, Futoshi","KOHZU, Ayato (); KAWAGUCHI, Yôichi (); NUNOKAWA, Masanori (); NAKAMURA, Futoshi ()",,"KOHZU, Ayato (); KAWAGUCHI, Yôichi (); NUNOKAWA, Masanori (); NAKAMURA, Futoshi ()",,,,,,,,,,,8,1,,0.56,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ece/7/2/7_2_201/_pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1037350700,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 37 Earth Sciences; 41 Environmental Sciences,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,

Using phylogeny, sound hypotheses on the ancestral states of characters and their subsequent changes can be made by polarizing the characters between related taxa. Hypotheses on evolutionary processes can also be tested by comparing the patterns they imply with independently inferred phylogenetic patterns. The power of the tests relies upon the independence of phylogenetic patterns (built with cladistics using Wagner parsimony) and the theoretical proposals under study. Classical assumptions on the evolution of troglobitic life are analysed with this methodology. The following points are discussed: what is a troglobitic taxon? Are there features characteristic of troglobitic taxa? Is troglobitic life an evolutionary dead end? What circumstances favour troglobitic evolution? Using phylogenetic analysis, the presence or absence of so‐called troglomorphic features were inferred in troglobitic taxa. In fact these taxa can be characterized only by their behavioural ecology. Pre‐adaptations (exaptations) can also be precisely defined. Cave living does not appear to be an evolutionary dead end. Two patterns subsequent to cave life appearance have been documented: speciation of troglobitic taxa in the subterranean environment, and reversal to an epigean habitat. Troglobitic life thus turns out to be one step in the diversification of clades. Troglobitic life is usually explained as an evolution under the pressure of unfavourable environmental conditions, or the conquest of a new resource, or the result of biological interactions (competition, predation). Phylogenetic analyses show that none of these hypotheses propose clear alternatives on cave life evolution. Moreover most of their a priori statements cannot easily be falsified. As such they have only limited explanatory power.",,,Journal of Zoological Systematics & Evolutionary Research,,Hindawi,"0947-5745, 1439-0469",,2009-04-27,2009,2009-04-27,,35,1,23-32,All OA; Gold,Article,"‐Grandcolas, L.Desutter","‐Grandcolas, L.Desutter (Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle de Paris, Laboratoire d'Entomologie, Paris)","‐Grandcolas, L.Desutter (National Museum of Natural History)","‐Grandcolas, L.Desutter (National Museum of Natural History)",National Museum of Natural History,grid.410350.3,Paris,,France,,,,,,31,2,,3.33,,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0469.1997.tb00400.x,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1036207389,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3104 Evolutionary Biology,,,,,,A05 Biological Sciences,

While it has become apparent that populations may show watershed‐specific responses to changing climate within a geographic region, the population dynamics of Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. suggest that within watershed climate filtering is also important. Growth provides an integrated measure of habitat quality capturing the overall response of individuals to climate as filtered by their habitat and their response to the biological interactions in the ecosystem. We used two different long‐term datasets, scales from returning adults and juvenile length measurements, to assess the response of sockeye salmon O. nerka growth during their juvenile life phase to single and integrated measures of climate within a watershed between 1950 and 2010. Scale growth showed evidence for differences among stocks rearing in different lake habitats within the same Alaska Peninsula watershed. These lakes have substantially different morphometry and showed opposite responses to changes in spring and fall air temperatures. Juvenile length data were also available for one of these stocks and indicated that density effects were relatively weak in contrast to the effects of temperature. While direct measures of juvenile length and measures derived from adult scales showed some similarity in their trends over time, they indicated opposite effects of air temperature. Throughout the range of Pacific salmon, climate change is altering freshwater ecosystems through changes to temperature, precipitation and associated variables. These data suggest that sockeye salmon populations are experiencing climate filtering at a sub‐watershed scale. Maintaining connected, heterogeneous landscapes will therefore likely be important for providing productive habitat for sockeye salmon across a range of climate conditions that they are going to experience under new climate regimes.","This is a contribution of the Univ. of Washington Alaska Salmon Program.

We tested this hypothesis on structurally complex, species‐rich biogenic reefs created by the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, in the Neuse River estuary, North Carolina, USA. We (1) sampled fishes and invertebrates on natural and restored reefs and on sand bottom to compare fish utilization of these different habitats and to characterize the trophic relations among large reef‐associated fishes and benthic invertebrates, and (2) tested whether bottom‐water hypoxia and fishery‐caused degradation of reef habitat combine to induce mass emigration of fish that then modify community composition in refuges across an estuarine seascape. Experimentally restored oyster reefs of two heights (1 m tall “degraded” or 2 m tall “natural” reefs) were constructed at 3 and 6 m depths. We sampled hydrographic conditions within the estuary over the summer to monitor onset and duration of bottom‐water hypoxia/anoxia, a disturbance resulting from density stratification and anthropogenic eutrophication. Reduction of reef height caused by oyster dredging exposed the reefs located in deep water to hypoxia/anoxia for >2 wk, killing reef‐associated invertebrate prey and forcing mobile fishes into refuge habitats. Refugee fishes accumulated at high densities on reefs in oxygenated shallow water, where they depleted epibenthic crustacean prey populations. Thus, physical disturbances can impact remote, undisturbed refuge habitats through the movement and abnormal concentration of refugee organisms that have subsequent strong trophic impacts. These results have implications for the design of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), showing that reserves placed in proximity to disturbed areas may be impacted indirectly but may serve a critical refuge function on a scale that matches the mobility of consumers.","We thank our technicians, Laura Hill and Rusty Day, for their enthusiastic and tireless efforts in the field and laboratory.

Although two‐species mutualisms are found in all types of ecosystems, the study of their ecological influences on other community members has mostly been limited to third species, while their influence on entire communities remains largely unexplored. 2 We hypothesized that mutualistic interactions between two respective ant species and an epiphyte mediate the biological traits composition of entire invertebrate communities that use the same host plant, thereby affecting food webs and functional diversity at the community level. 3 Aechmea mertensii (Bromeliaceae) is both a phytotelm (‘plant‐held water’) and an ant‐garden epiphyte. We sampled 111 bromeliads (111 aquatic invertebrate communities) associated with either the ant Pachycondyla goeldii or Camponotus femoratus. The relationships between ants, bromeliads and invertebrate abundance data were examined using a redundancy analysis. Biological traits information for invertebrates was structured using a fuzzy‐coding technique, and a co‐inertia analysis between traits and abundance data was used to interpret functional differences in bromeliad ecosystems. 4 The vegetative traits of A. mertensii depended on seed dispersion by C. femoratus and P. goeldii along a gradient of local conditions. The ant partner selected sets of invertebrates with traits that were best adapted to the bromeliads’ morphology, and so the composition of the biological traits of invertebrate phytotelm communities depends on the identity of the ant partner. Biological traits suggest a bottom‐up control of community structure in C. femoratus‐associated phytotelmata and a greater structuring role for predatory invertebrates in P. goeldii‐associated plants. 5 This study presents new information showing that two‐species mutualisms affect the functional diversity of a much wider range of organisms. Most biological systems form complex networks where nodes (e.g. species) are more or less closely linked to each other, either directly or indirectly, through intermediate nodes.

499,pub.1123666403,10.2983/035.038.0324,,,,Behavioral Defenses of Shellfish Prey under Ocean Acidification,"Biological interactions between predators and prey constitute a key component of the ecology and evolution of marine systems, and animal behavior can affect the outcome of predatorprey interactions. It has been recently demonstrated that CO2-induced ocean acidification can alter the behavior of marine organisms and potentially alter predatorprey dynamics. This study combines both quantitative (meta-analysis) and qualitative approaches to review the effects of ocean acidification on behavioral prey defenses in marine invertebrates. A systematic literature search identified 34 studies that experimentally assessed behavioral defenses under elevated pCO2 spanning three phyla: crustaceans, echinoderms, and molluscs. A meta-analysis suggested that exposure to elevated seawater pCO2 can negatively affect behavioral defenses in bivalve molluscs and malacostracan crustaceans. By contrast, defenses of cephalopod molluscs seem to be positively impacted by elevated pCO2, whereas gastropods and echinoids appear unaffected. A qualitative assessment of studies on combined effects of ocean acidification and warming revealed that combined effects typically differ from ocean acidificationonly effects. Based on a qualitative assessment of three studies to date, neurological interference of GABAA receptors under elevated pCO2 may play a major role in ocean acidification effects on prey defense behaviors; however, more research is needed, and other mechanistic underpinnings are also important to consider. Ultimately, the results of this study suggest that behavioral prey defenses in some shellfish taxa may be vulnerable to ocean acidification, that the effects of ocean acidification are often different under warming scenarios than under present-day temperature scenarios, and that GABAA interference may be an important mechanism underpinning behavioral responses of shellfish prey under ocean acidification. Despite the importance of shellfish behavioral defenses in the ecology and evolution of marine biological communities, however, research to date has only scraped the surface in understanding ocean acidification effects. Increased research efforts on the effects of multiple stressors, acclimation and adaptation, environmental variability, and complex situational and ecological contexts are needed. Studies of fish behavioral defenses under ocean acidification can help streamline hypotheses and experimental approaches, particularly given the similar effects of elevated pCO2 on GABAA function.","The authors wish to thank Dr. Rmi Sonier and Dr. Denise Mth at DFO Gulf for their constructive feedback on an earlier version of the manuscript.

The diversity and biomass of epilithic biofilms were determined along a subtropical intertidal rocky shore at Xpicob, Southern Gulf of Mexico (Campeche, Mexico). Biofilm diversity was assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of partial 16 S rRNA genes using single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP). Triplicate 2 cm×2 cm biofilm samples per site were taken randomly from 0.6 m×0.6 m quadrats located in two sampling sites, established 20 m apart within a homogeneous calcareous intertidal platform. Twenty-two partial rRNA sequences, belonging to four bacterial divisions (

In addition, most of the detected organisms from other bacterial lineages had closest relatives displaying biofilm phenotypes that suggested stressful conditions (i.e. desiccation) prevailed in the intertidal shores; this was selecting for biofilm-forming or thick-sheathed organisms as an ecological adaptation to withstand the conditions. Unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) analysis of SSCP profiles indicated that there was significant spatial heterogeneity in biofilm community composition across different scales of analysis and that this heterogeneity was related to the distance at which samples were taken. This analysis showed that certain organisms appeared to be station specific and that the biofilm community structure varied even on a small scale (1 cm). Since no significant differences in bulk sea water or substratum physicochemistry were observed, these results suggest that small-scale variability of environmental conditions, surface properties and/or biological interactions (i.e. allelopathy) may be important factors structuring these biofilm communities.",,,Biofilms,,Cambridge University Press (CUP),"1479-0505, 1479-0513",,2005-04,2005,2005-05-11,2005-04,2,2,93-103,Closed,Article,"Narváez-Zapata, J.; Tebbe, C.

The ecological relationships between micro- and macroalgae in low-order tropical streams,"Streambeds are abundantly colonized by benthic algal assemblages. Environmental factors are the most assessed to find out predictable correlations between algal presence and habitat conditions, but biological interactions can also be important determinant of species composition in stream algae communities. Although there is plenty of information about algal ecology, the mechanisms leading their spatial distribution remain insufficiently clarified. Herein, we contribute to a better understanding regarding this latter issue, carrying out an experimental study to assess possible interactions between micro- and macroalgae during a successional process (75 days) in nine streams, using artificial substrates. The experimental analyses revealed the following main results: (i) streams with higher abundance of macroalgae also registered higher microalgal densities; (ii) the relative interaction index showed values greater than zero for all sampling dates, suggesting positive interaction between micro- and macroalgae during colonization process; and (iii) the multiple partial regression analyses (redundancy, pRDA) showed that environmental variables and microalgae density together explained 25% of macroalgal variation. These results indicate that interactions between stream micro- and macroalgae may contribute to shape the community structure during the successional process on the streambed. As observed previously, microalgae are early successional settlers and macroalgae are late successors, but both community components, besides their inherent competition, seem to cooperate in order to keep their coexistence. Based on this perspective, some typical ecological concepts related to the stream macroalgae, specially from tropical regions, may be expanded. For instance, studies have reported that the highest richness and abundance of lotic macroalgae in tropical/subtropical streams are determined basically by variation in climatic and environmental factors. Our results showed that, in addition to climatic and environmental factors, the increase in richness and abundance of stream macroalgae may also be affected by biotic interactions. In this context, our results suggest that the higher abundance of microalgae on the streambed seems to allow a better development of the benthic algal community, reaching to the later successional stages, in which the relative occurrence of larger and more complex algae (i.e., macroalgae) become more evident.","The authors would like to thank FAPESP for financial support granted to AFT (Proc. 2010/17563-0) and to CCZB (Proc. 2014/22952-6), and CNPq for financial support granted to CCZB (Proc. 302354/2008-5).

498,pub.1069662322,10.2307/1938410,,,,Ecological Systems in Hierarchical Perspecitive: Breaks in Community Structure and Other Consequences,"Explanation of the patterns of species abundances is important because it may help in understanding mechanisms structuring communities. A general conceptual model is proposed and examined as an alternative to previous propositions, which focused too narrowly on specific mechanisms. According to this model, viewing the structure of an environment as a nested hierarchy of habitat units provides a general mechanism sufficient to account for empirically established regularities in species abundances. Various biotic and abiotic factors can be considered as specific mechanisms sorting biological components into respective levels and compartments of the hierarchical structure of the environment. Because ""sizes"" of these compartments vary in a predictable way as a function of their position in the hierarchy, so should the abundances. The model may provide a conceptual framework that allows evaluation of the relative contributions of competition, predation, and other biological interactions. The operational and highly simplified version of the model uses spatial or temporal measures of ecological ranges of species to facilitate testing of the general model. The operational model makes three qualitative and quantitative predictions: (1) although the species display a continuous gradation of properties, the nested hierarchy of habitat units should lead to clustering of species at distinct levels; (2) generalists should be relatively more successful than specialists, (3) relative abundances of species should be predictable from their position in the hierarchical structure. An analysis of eight communities, including flatworms, aquatic insects, foraminiferans, rodents, and birds, supports these predictions. The clusters, or ""breaks"" in community structure, appear to be a new and possibly general property. Moreover, quantitative predictions of relative abundances for these communities are in surprisingly good agreement with the actual abundances. A hierarchical structure of the environment appears promising in accounting for some poorly explained community—level phenomena, such as correlation between the species range and abundance, and differences between abundance structures of communities in rigorous and less severe environments. The model is compatible with commonly observed as well as irregular patterns of distribution of species abundances, with high local abundance of some species, with differentiation of extinction probabilities, and with scale dependence of ecological phenomena.",,,Ecology,,Wiley,"0012-9658, 1939-9170",,1989-02-01,1989,1989-02-01,1989-02,70,1,36-47,Closed,Article,"Kolasa, Jerzy","Kolasa, Jerzy ()",,"Kolasa, Jerzy ()",,,,,,,,,,,120,1,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1069662322,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 41 Environmental Sciences,,,,,,A05 Biological Sciences,14 Life Below Water
498,pub.1028250378,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2005.07.028,,,,Exploring ecological patterns with structural equation modeling and Bayesian analysis,"Structural equation modeling is a multivariate statistical method that allows evaluation of a network of relationships between manifest and latent variables. In this statistical technique, preconceptualizations that reflect research questions or existing knowledge of system structure create the initial framework for model development, while both direct and indirect effects and measurement errors are considered. Given the interesting features of this method, it is quite surprising that the number of applications in ecology is limited, and even less common in aquatic ecosystems. This study presents two examples where structural equation modeling is used for exploring ecological structures; i.e., summer epilimnetic phytoplankton dynamics. Both eutrophic (Lake Mendota) and mesotrophic (Lake Washington) conditions were used to test an initial hypothesized model that considered the regulatory role of abiotic factors and biological interactions on lake phytoplankton dynamics and water clarity during the summer stratification period. Generally, the model gave plausible results, while a higher proportion of the observed variability was accounted for in the eutrophic environment. Most importantly, we show that structural equation modeling provided a convenient means for assessing the relative role of several ecological processes (e.g., vertical mixing, intrusions of the hypolimnetic nutrient stock, herbivory) known to determine the levels of water quality variables of management interest (e.g., water clarity, cyanobacteria). A Bayesian hierarchical methodology is also introduced to relax the classical identifiability restrictions and treat them as stochastic. Additional advantages of the Bayesian approach are the flexible incorporation of prior knowledge on parameters, the ability to get information on multimodality in marginal densities (undetectable by standard procedures), and the fact that the structural equation modeling process does not rely on asymptotic theory which is particularly important when the sample size is small (commonly experienced in environmental studies). Special emphasis is given on how this Bayesian methodological framework can be used for assessing eutrophic conditions and assisting water quality management. Structural equation modeling has several attractive features that can be particularly useful to researchers when exploring ecological patterns or disentangling complex environmental management issues.","This study was funded by a grant from the Water Environment Research Foundation through the University of North Carolina Water Resources Research Institute.

Large‐scale manipulations of human access replicated over a range of physical and biological conditions can generate insights over the processes shaping marine assemblages. We examined the relative roles of human impacts and hydrographic conditions on assemblages of shallow (3–10 m depth) rocky reefs by comparing no‐take reserves with fishing areas occurring in gradients of exposure of the coastline to dominant winds and waves around two Mediterranean islands, Capraia and Giannutri, Italy. We hypothesized that fishing influences assemblages directly by reducing populations of target fish species, and indirectly by reducing predation on sea urchins, intensifying herbivory, and causing “barrens” of encrusting coralline algae. We examined how the possible effects of fishing varied with physical exposure of the coastline. The composition of fish assemblages differed significantly between sites within no‐take reserves and fished reference sites. Abundances and sizes of predatory fishes targeted by local fisheries were greater in no‐take reserves than in fished areas. Sea urchin densities, the extent of coralline barrens, and the structure of the algal and invertebrate benthic assemblages showed clear variation associated with exposure of the coastline to dominant winds and waves, but weak effects of protection from human use. Densities of the black sea urchin Arbacia lixula were significantly greater along the windward than along the leeward sides of the islands, and were positively correlated with the extent of coralline barrens. In contrast, the purple sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus was more abundant along the leeward sides of islands and showed indirect responses to protection at Giannutri, where purple sea urchins tended to have greater densities at fished than at protected sites. Protection from fishing influenced fish assemblages directly, and benthic assemblages indirectly, but the latter effect was observed only at sites with lower physical exposure. Indirect effects of fishing and recovery of assemblages within marine protected areas through cascading trophic interactions are likely to vary depending on local physical conditions and on the characteristics of species that are locally dominant.","We thank S.

Effects of epibiosis on the trophic relationships of mussels and epibiotic barnacles","The dynamics determining the establishment and maintenance of epibiotic relationships are fundamental to understand the role of biological interactions in the functioning of marine coastal ecosystems. Epibiosis of barnacles on mussels is a common feature of many intertidal rocky shores. There are several possible explanations for this relationship, but it is unclear whether the association is commensal, antagonistic, or mutualistic. We investigated the diets of barnacles and mussels in an epibiotic relationship (epibiont barnacle and basibiont mussel), and compared them to the diets of conspecifics living on the same rocky shore but independently (free barnacle and free mussel), using stable isotope (SI) and fatty acid (FA) techniques. The SI results indicated that the diet of mussels did not change as a function of epibiosis, while free barnacles were characterized by higher δ15N values than epibiotic conspecifics, indicating that they were feeding on more recycled food sources. This result was, however, supported by data from only one site. Results from FA were partially consistent with those of SI analysis, indicating that mussel FA profiles did not change between basibiont and free mussels, but that epibiotic barnacles were characterized by a lower amount of polyunsaturated FA than free barnacles. This suggests that the diet of epibiotic barnacles is of lower quality. This could be due to competition for food with mussels, driven by the different mechanisms of food assimilation between epibiotic barnacle and basibiont mussel; or by the different sizes of particles ingested by the two species under epibiosis vs free-living conditions. The discrepancy between the FA and SI results observed could reflect the different integration time of the analytical techniques, with FA reflecting shorter term variability than SI. We conclude that epibiosis represents an unfavourable relationship for barnacles due to the lower quality of food available when colonizing mussel shells, whereas mussels neither benefit nor were harmed by this association.

Here the term “purification” is defined, in a wide sense, as the potential role of a water body to contribute to the reduction of pollutants and thus controlling eutrophication. Also regarded as a kind of ecological regulating services, biological purification involves various processes concerning seasonal nutrient fixation, such as uptake by aquatic macrophytes, biofouling onto foliage substrates, feeding by organisms in higher trophic level, and eternal loss or removal of substance from the water. In order to evaluate the water purification ability, a numerical lake ecosystem model highlighting the role of macrophyte colonies in the shore zone was developed and applied to Lakes Suwa, Kasumi and Biwa, as well as five small lakes attached to Lake Biwa.The model includes the biological interactions between pelagic compartments (phyto- and zooplankton, detritus, dissolved organic matter, pelagic fish and nutrients) and benthic compartments (macrophytes, epiphytic algae, phytal animals, macro- and megalobenthos, and demersal fish). Under dynamic forcing of meteorological and hydrological parameters, the model was run over a year to evaluate the annual nutrient cycles and purification functions. The reproducibility of the model was validated for each water body by comparison with the field data from the water quality monitoring campaign. Numerical results revealed that the water purification ability, from viewpoints of both stock and flux, generally tends to be higher in the shore region than in the offshore region owing to a wide variety of aquatic biota. Moreover, it increases almost in proportion to the density of vegetation in the shore region. Nutrient fluxes representing the purification processes turned out to be closely connected with the surface area or equivalently with the retention time of the water bodies, suggesting that biological purification does not become dominant against physical turnover until the surface area reaches around 103 ha or the retention time exceeds the order of 102 days.","The paper summarizes the results from the modeling study on comprehensive purification functions of inland water bodies, conducted by the Japan Fishery Resources Conservation Association under a grant from the Japan Fisheries Agency, as part of a 5-year project on anti-eutrophication measures in fisheries.

498,pub.1000064125,10.1890/es11-00253.1,,,,Competitive outcomes between herbivorous consumers can be predicted from their stoichiometric demands,"Exploitative competition for food resources is one of the crucial biological interactions in nature. However, few studies have experimentally tested if competitive ability of consumer species changes depending on elemental contents of the food, although it has been suggested by the theories of resource ratio for competition and ecological stoichiometry. To verify if competitive superiority actually changes according to elemental contents of the food, competition experiments were conducted using high and low P algal food and three Daphnia species (D. galeata, D. pulicaria, and D. tanakai) with different threshold levels of carbon (TFC) and phosphorus (TFP) necessary for individual growth. Since the TFCs of D. tanakai and D. pulicaria were similar to each other but lower than that of D. galeata, we specifically predicted that when fed high P food (i.e., limited by C), D. tanakai and D. pulicaria would be competitively equal to each other but superior to D. galeata. We also predicted from their TFPs that when fed low P food, D. pulicaria would outcompete D. tanakai and D. galeata, while neither of the latter two would be competitively superior to the other. The results showed that when one of the two competitors was predicted to be competitively superior, the food level under competition was similar to the TFC (or TFP) of the superior species but lower than that of the other inferior species, and that the biomass of the former was much less affected by the competition. Also, when the two competing species were predicted to be competitively equal, the food levels under competition were generally similar to the TFC (or TFP) of both species and their biomasses decreased by the same magnitude. The results thus accorded well with the predictions from the TFC and TFP, and indicate that competitive superiority between the same two Daphnia species changes depending on P:C ratio of algal food. This study provides firm evidence for the first time that resource ratio theory can be applied to competition between animal consumers for essential substances packaged within a single food resource.","We deeply appreciate James M.

498,pub.1138502728,10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107832,,,,Drivers of abundance and spatial distribution in Southern Ocean peracarid crustacea,"The Southern Ocean (SO) continental shelf and deep sea are environments characterised by different benthic communities. Their structure and composition are driven and shaped by different variables: whilst on the continental shelf physical environmental variables are the main drivers shaping faunal abundance, structure and composition, the deep-sea fauna is most problably driven by biological variables such as predation and competition. Among shelf and deep-sea benthic communities, peracarids (e.g. amphipods and isopods) are one of the most dominant groups, showing high levels of abundance and diversity in both environments. Knowledge on their assemblage structure and composition in the SO remains limited, as well as the knowledge of the environmental variables that influence them. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate peracarid assemblages from the SO continental shelf and deep sea and to assess the main drivers shaping their assemblage structure along a wide bathymetric gradient (from 160 m to about 6000 m depth) and at a large geographic scale. We analysed the spatial distribution of 183,606 peracarids sampled using an epibenthic sledge (EBS) during nine different expeditions in the SO, covering a latitudinal range of 77° to 41° South. Depth was identified as the main driver shaping peracarid abundance pattern, their assemblage structure from the continental shelf (<1499 m) was dissimilar to that from the deep sea (>1500 m). Also, depth was differently correlated with different peracarid orders: while isopod abundances increased with depth, amphipods and mysids were negatively correlated; no correlation was found with cumaceans and tanaidaceans. The dissimilar peracarid assemblage structure between the SO continental shelf and the SO deep sea can be due to the assumption that there are different driving forces shaping benthic assemblages from these two environments (physical variables on the continental shelf, biological interactions in the deep sea). As a result, we also suggest that environmental changes due to climate change (e.g. temperature, ice coverage, productivity) would have different consequences depending on the bathymetric range considered.","We are grateful to the captains and crews of RV Polarstern and RRS James Clarke Ross for their support, especially for our EBS deployments, during multiple expeditions.

In particular, techniques that use habitat restoration alone or restoration in combination with built infrastructure to provide coastal protective services are growing in popularity. These novel approaches, often called living shorelines, have the potential to expand the reach and applicability of coastal restoration projects. To understand how living shorelines research has expanded over time, we conducted a scoping review of English-language peer-reviewed articles. We included papers that self-identified as living shorelines research, as well as studies that used other related terminology, to investigate trends in publication rates, geography, site characteristics, and outcomes measured. Using a systematic search protocol, we compiled a database of 46 papers; the earliest study was published in 1981, and the earliest study to use the term living shoreline was published in 2008. Eighty-three percent of studies were conducted in North America, followed by 11% in Asia, and 7% in Europe, but the use of the term living shoreline was almost exclusively restricted to North America. Saltmarshes, oyster reefs, mangroves, and freshwater vegetation were used in living shoreline designs, but 91% of studies also incorporated structural materials like oyster shell and rock. Most living shorelines research was conducted at sites that were <5 years old. The vast majority of studies exclusively reported on ecological outcomes (89%), and of those, ecological processes were measured in 74% of studies. Processes related to coastal protection were measured most frequently (52% of ecological studies), followed by biological interactions, water filtration, nutrient cycling, and carbon sequestration. Altogether, our data suggest that living shorelines research is on the rise, but there is a need for more long-term data, socio-economic research, further consensus on the terminology used to describe different types of projects, and research on the types of living shorelines that are most effective in different environmental contexts. Future long-term and interdisciplinary research will help to elucidate the full effects of living shorelines.",This research was partly conducted during a Marine Ecology class at the Duke University Marine Lab and we would like to thank the students that assisted with data extraction.,"Funding.

The flowering season of these species highly overlapped and they shared the same method of pollination (via bumblebees). The floral density and nectar production were higher in P. caerulea in the early snowmelt habitat, but they were higher in P. aleutica in the late snowmelt habitat, reflecting the species‐specific sensitivity to a short growing season. Bumblebee preference shifted from P. caerulea to P. aleutica along the snowmelt gradient, reflecting the changes in the relative reward level between the species. The extent of pollen limitation of P. caerulea was severe in the late snowmelt habitat, whereas that of P. aleutica was obvious in the early snowmelt habitat. A pollination experiment revealed that P. caerulea showed a consistently low selfing ability, whereas P. aleutica showed a high selfing ability in the early snowmelt habitat and shifted to an obligate outcrosser in the late snowmelt habitat. The frequency of interspecific bumblebee movement for P. caerulea from P. aleutica increased in the late snowmelt habitat. To the contrary, the frequency of interspecific movement for P. aleutica from P. caerulea decreased along the snowmelt gradient. P. caerulea did not indicate heterospecific incompatibility to P. aleutica pollen. In contrast, P. aleutica indicated heterospecific incompatibility to P. caerulea pollen, reflecting the high risk of receiving heterospecific pollen as a result of interspecific bumblebee movement. However, heterospecific compatibility of P. aleutica disappeared in the late snowmelt habitat, where the risk of heterospecific pollen receipt was low. Therefore, changes in interspecific bumblebee movement might have been responsible for the variation in heterospecific incompatibility among P. aleutica populations. The local snowmelt gradient creates diverse biological interactions and mating system evolution in the alpine ecosystem.","This study was supported in part by a grant from the Ministry of Education, Sciences and Culture, Japan to G.

Differentiation between additive, multiplicative, antagonistic, and synergistic effects","Aluminum toxicity is an important factor limiting plant growth in soils with pH below 5.0. Because metalliferous soils are commonly acidic, understanding plant growth dynamics on such soils may require insight into the interaction between aluminum and other phytotoxic metals. To investigate potential interactions in the phytotoxicity of nickel and aluminum, seedlings of Triticum aestivum L. cv. Neepawa were grown for 14 days in solution culture with varying concentrations of nickel (0–60 μM), with or without 40 μM aluminum.

Aluminum as a second phytotoxic metal further reduced root (0.698–0.194 g) and leaf (2.245–1.111 g) weights at low concentrations of nickel in solution. Analysis of variance of the root weight data indicated a significant nickel × aluminum interaction, but this may not have been indicative of a biological interaction. Root weight, both in the presence and absence of aluminum, decreased to a common minimum at high concentrations of nickel in the growth solution, possibly reflecting biomass present at the onset of experimental treatments and the lag time required for the expression of the phytotoxic growth response. When root growth relative to control was expressed as weight above the empirical minimum (the root weight index), results of the analysis of variance were different. Significant main effects of nickel were detected, while main effects due to aluminum and the nickel × aluminum interaction were not significant. Despite antagonistic effects observed with metal uptake and accumulation, such results suggest that the combined toxic effect of nickel and aluminum can be explained by a simple multiplicative model.",,,Botany,,Canadian Science Publishing,"1916-2790, 1916-2804, 0008-4026, 1480-3305",,1989-08-01,1989,,1989-08-01,67,8,2272-2276,Closed,Article,"Taylor, Gregory J.","Taylor, Gregory J.

This study concentrated on analyzing the spatial and temporal aspects of phytoplankton chlorophyll variability in these areas using an integrated dataset from a Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), Advanced Very High Resolution (AVHRR) sensor, and Conductivity Temperature Depth (CTD) sensor. The results showed that chlorophyll concentrations were elevated in coastal and open ocean regions, with strong summer and fall blooms, which appeared to spread out in most of the enclosed bays and neighboring waters due to certain oceanographic processes. The chlorophyll concentration was observed to range between 3 and 54 mg m-3 inside Jin-hae Bay and adjacent coastal bays and 0.5 and 8 mg m-3 in the southeast sea offshore waters, this gradual decrease towards oceanic waters suggested physical transports of phytoplankton blooms from the shallow shelves to slope waters through the influence of the Tsushima Warm Current (TWC) along the Tsushima Strait. Horizontal distribution of potential temperature (θ) and salinity (S) of water off the southeastern coast exhibited cold and low saline surface water (θ<19°C; S<32.4) and warm and high saline subsurface water (θ>12°C; S>34.4) at 75dBar, corroborating TWC intrusion along the Tsushima Strait. An eastward branch of this current was called the East Korean Warm Current (EKWC), tracked with the help of CTD data and satellite-derived sea surface temperature, which often influenced the dynamics of mesoscale anticyclonic eddy fields off the Korean east coast during the summer season. The process of such mesoscale anticyclonic eddy features might have produced interior upwelling that could have shoaled and steepened the nutricline, enhancing phytoplankton population by advection or diffusion of nutrients in the vicinity of Ulleungdo in the East Sea.",,,Ocean Science Journal,,Springer Nature,"1738-5261, 2005-7172",,2005-06,2005,,2005-06,40,2,67-71,Closed,Article,"Ahn, Yu -Hwan; Shanmugam, Palanisamy; Chang, Kyung- Il; Moon, Jeong -Eon; Ryu, Joo -Hyung","Ahn, Yu -Hwan (Satellite Ocean Research Laboratory, KORDI, P.O.

In particular, the stalks of glass sponges (hexactinellids) provide hard substrata and act as habitat islands for deep-sea fauna. The primary objectives of this study were to determine the abundance of glass sponge “stalks” at an abyssal station in the NE Pacific, to identify the fauna associated with stalks, and to compare the distribution patterns of epifaunal taxa both horizontally and vertically. Densities of stalks and large epifauna were estimated from analysis of ∼9 km of photographic transects taken in 1994–1995 at station M (34°45′N; 123°00′W; 4,100 m depth) off California, USA. At least 87% of the stalks were the spicule columns of live or dead hexactinellids in the genus Hyalonema (Gray, 1832). Stalks appeared to be distributed randomly across the sea floor (density: 0.13 stalks m−2). A colonial zoanthid, Epizoanthus stellaris (Hertwig, 1888), inhabited 20% of the stalks and was the most commonly observed epifaunal organism, followed by other suspension feeders that generally were situated at the top of the structures. Thirty-five stalk communities were collected in tube cores in 1994–1995 using the submersible “Alvin”. A total of 139 taxa was associated with these hard-substratum habitats (another five species were observed only in photographs). Although taxon richness was high, the species diversity of these communities was relatively low due to the dominance in percentage abundance of a foraminiferan, Cibicides lobatulus (Walker and Jakob, 1798), and a serpulid polychaete, Bathyvermilia sp. (Zibrowius, 1973). The relationship between number of taxa and surface area of the stalks yielded a slope (z-value) typical of islands with a low rate of immigration. Three-dimensional complexity created by branching epifauna on the stalks provided more surface area and a variety of cryptic microhabitats. Vertical zonation on the stalks appeared to be controlled by biological interactions among species, with solitary fauna and certain functional groups of colonial organisms restricted by sheet-like colonial organisms that appeared to be dominant space competitors.",,,Marine Biology,,Springer Nature,"0025-3162, 1432-1793",,2001-04,2001,,2001-04,138,4,803-817,Closed,Article,"Beaulieu, S.

498,pub.1150764975,10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02279,,,,Ecological niche modeling of interactions in a buzz-pollinated invasive weed,"Plant species that are alien and invasive represent an important threat to biodiversity and ecosystem function. These plants compete with native flora for resources and pollinator services. Although most invasive plant species do not depend on pollinators for reproduction and can reproduce uniparentally, some depend on pollinator-assisted reproduction and therefore rely on recruitment of pollinators in the new habitat. Here, we studied Solanum rostratum, a high-risk invasive weed widely distributed around the world that depends on buzz-pollination. It has a floral morphology that depends on medium and large-sized buzzing bees for pollination. The main aim of this study is to model the distribution of an invasive plant, Solanum rostratum, using ecological niches based on its buzz-pollinator distribution. Thus, we hypothesized that S. rostratum is more likely to establish successfully in geographic regions where the appropriate buzz pollinators are also found. We considered the realized and potential distribution of S. rostratum and its pollinators based on occurrence data and ecological niche models combining both abiotic (climatic conditions) and biotic (potential pollinator distribution) factors using the MaxEnt algorithm. Five climatic variables related to temperature and precipitation were important in determining the realized distribution of S. rostratum, while seasonal temperature was the most important variable in determining pollinator distribution. The distributions of the bumblebees (Bombus fraternus, B. griseocollis, and B. impatiens) were closely related to the realized distribution of S. rostratum. However, the potential distribution of S. rostratum is wider than that of the pollinator included here, suggesting that other factors such as modifications in the reproductive system or recruitment of other buzzing and non-buzzing bees might be occurring in some invasive populations. We also found that S. rostratum has the potential to expand to unoccupied regions in South America, South Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East. In conclusion, modeling of niches used by invasive species considering both climatic variables and biological interactions such as pollination would be very useful to study and predict the distribution of invasive plants which depend on pollinators to reproduce and establish in new habitats.","We thank Berenice Vázquez for her help in data depuration, Hicham Chelghoum for sharing his observation points in Argelia, Mario Vallejo-Marin, Guadalupe Andraca, David Haymer and two anonymous reviewers for their comments and suggestions for the early version of the manuscript.

498,pub.1016246334,10.1007/s12229-013-9126-7,,,,The Multifunctional Role of Ectomycorrhizal Associations in Forest Ecosystem Processes,"Belowground biological interactions that occur among plant roots, microorganisms and animals are dynamic and substantially influence ecosystem processes. Among these interactions, the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis is remarkable but unfortunately these associations have mainly been considered within the rather narrow perspective of their effects on the uptake of dissolved mineral nutrients by individual plants. More recent research has placed emphasis on a wider, multifunctional perspective, including the effects of ectomycorrhizal symbiosis on plant and microbial communities, and on ecosystem processes. This includes mobilization of N and P from organic polymers, release of nutrients from mineral particles or rock surfaces via weathering, effects on carbon cycling, interactions with mycoheterotrophic plants, mediation of plant responses to stress factors such as drought, soil acidification, toxic metals, and plant pathogens, rehabilitation and regeneration of degraded forest ecosystems, as well as a range of possible interactions with groups of other soil microorganisms. Ectomycorrhizas are almost invariably characterized by a Hartig net composed of highly branched hyphae which entirely surround the outer root cortical cells. The Hartig net is the place of massive bidirectional exchanges of nutrients between the host and the fungus. Through these branched hyphae ectomycorrhizal fungi connect their plant hosts to the heterogeneously distributed nutrients required for their growth, enabling the flow of energy-rich compounds required for nutrient mobilization whilst simultaneously providing conduits for the translocation of mobilized products back to their hosts. In addition to increasing the nutrient absorptive surface area of their host plant root systems, the extraradical mycelium of ectomycorrhizal fungi provides a direct pathway for translocation of photosynthetically derived carbon from their hosts to microsites in the soil and a large surface area for interaction with other soil micro-organisms. The detailed functioning and regulation of these mycorrhizosphere processes is still poorly understood and needs detailed molecular approach to study these mycorrhizosphere processes but recent progress in ectomycorrhizal associations is reviewed and potential benefits of improved understanding of mycorrhizosphere interactions are discussed.","The authors are highly grateful to the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India for providing financial grant for the conduct of research.

The impact of climate oscillations like El Niño‐Southern Oscillation on coastal environments in the short term likely mimics those of climate change in the long term; therefore, El Niños may serve as a short‐term proxy for possible long‐term ecological responses to an increasingly variable climate. Understanding and prediction of ecosystem responses requires elucidating the mechanisms underlying different organizational scales (organism, space, and time). We analyzed spatiotemporal variation in the effect of the 2015–2016 El Niño and the overlapping 2014–2016 East Pacific MHW on three intertidal kelps (Hedophyllum sessile, Egregia menziesii, and Postelsia palmaeformis) at seven sites across 300 km of the Oregon coast and over three years post El Niño. We measured percent cover, density, maximum length, growth, and carbon : nitrogen (C:N) ratios monthly in spring/summer at each site from 2016 through 2018. Results revealed a complex interplay between spatial, temporal, and biological factors that modified the effects of these thermal anomalies on Oregon intertidal kelp populations. Our findings generally agree with prior literature showing detrimental effects of El Niño on kelp. However, El Niño and possibly MHW effects can be mitigated or amplified by environmental processes and kelp life history strategies. In our study, coastal upwelling provided regional relief for the kelp individuals with respect to their growth needs and mitigated the adverse effects of warming. On the other hand, we also found that coastal upwelling amplified, or compounded, detrimental effects of El Niño by increasing phytoplankton‐induced shading and mollusk grazing on juvenile and adult kelps, thereby reducing their density. Given the greater uncertainty associated with warming events and climate change in the California Current Upwelling System and its biological implications, our findings reiterate the importance of acquiring better understanding of how context‐specific underlying conditions modify ecosystem processes. More specifically, understanding how demographic traits and life history stages of kelp change with biological interactions and environmental forcing over temporal and spatial scales is crucial to anticipating future climate change ramifications.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We are grateful to the many people who assisted with collecting and entering kelp survey data (H.

498,pub.1029158991,10.2307/1942506,,,,Larval Settlement and Juvenile Mortality in a Recruitment‐Limited Coral Reef Fish Population,"The temporal and spatial patterns of larval settlement of the bluehead wrasse, Thalasoma bifasciatum, were documented in the San Blas Islands of Panama. Daily censuses indicated that larvae settle onto coral reefs in brief episodes that tended to occur around the new moon and peak in intensity between August and December of each year. The magnitude of settlement each day was unrelated to changes in the local population size but was found to be significantly correlated with the nightly catch of planktonic reef fish larvae in the waters over the reef. The spatial pattern of settlement was examined on three scales. On a large geographic scale, 24 reefs within 1000 km2, there was tremendous variability in settlement intensity that was very consistent from one year to the next. The best correlate of recruit density was exposure to the onshore current. It is suggested that some large—scale oceanographic process determines the intensity of settlement of bluehead wrasses on this scale. The densities of adults on these reefs directly reflected the densities of recruits. Counts of daily otolith increments indicated that those larvae that settled onto low—density reefs subsequently grew significantly faster. On an intermediate scale, sites within 1 km2, there was no consistency among sites or months in settlement intensity, suggesting that variance in settlement intensity on this scale may be the product of random processes. On the smallest scale, habitat selection within a patch reef, it was found that recruits had distinct preferences in their choices of settlement sites. The daily mortality schedule of bluehead wrasses indicated that mortality was extremely high for the first 3 d on the reef. Juvenile mortality was, furthermore, found to be independent of density. As a result, the patterns of larval settlement of bluehead wrasses persisted into the adult population relatively unchanged. It is therefore proposed that the distribution and abundance of bluehead wrasses in this region are more a product of the external processes controlling larval settlement than of any biological interactions within the reef assemblage.",,,Ecological Monographs,,Wiley,"0012-9615, 1557-7015",,1986-06,1986,1986-06,1986-06,56,2,145-160,Closed,Article,"Victor, Benjamin C.","Victor, Benjamin C.

498,pub.1020788787,10.1007/s12237-008-9047-6,,,,Consequences of Climate Change on the Ecogeomorphology of Coastal Wetlands,"Climate impacts on coastal and estuarine systems take many forms and are dependent on the local conditions, including those set by humans. We use a biocomplexity framework to provide a perspective of the consequences of climate change for coastal wetland ecogeomorphology. We concentrate on three dimensions of climate change affects on ecogeomorphology: sea level rise, changes in storm frequency and intensity, and changes in freshwater, sediment, and nutrient inputs. While sea level rise, storms, sedimentation, and changing freshwater input can directly impact coastal and estuarine wetlands, biological processes can modify these physical impacts. Geomorphological changes to coastal and estuarine ecosystems can induce complex outcomes for the biota that are not themselves intuitively obvious because they are mediated by networks of biological interactions. Human impacts on wetlands occur at all scales. At the global scale, humans are altering climate at rapid rates compared to the historical and recent geological record. Climate change can disrupt ecological systems if it occurs at characteristic time scales shorter than ecological system response and causes alterations in ecological function that foster changes in structure or alter functional interactions. Many coastal wetlands can adjust to predicted climate change, but human impacts, in combination with climate change, will significantly affect coastal wetland ecosystems. Management for climate change must strike a balance between that which allows pulsing of materials and energy to the ecosystems and promotes ecosystem goods and services, while protecting human structures and activities. Science-based management depends on a multi-scale understanding of these biocomplex wetland systems. Causation is often associated with multiple factors, considerable variability, feedbacks, and interferences. The impacts of climate change can be detected through monitoring and assessment of historical or geological records. Attribution can be inferred through these in conjunction with experimentation and modeling. A significant challenge to allow wise management of coastal wetlands is to develop observing systems that act at appropriate scales to detect global climate change and its effects in the context of the various local and smaller scale effects.",This work was supported by the National Science Foundation grant NSF-DEB-0124293 to the Estuarine Research Federation Initiative in Biocomplexity: Facilitation of Research on Estuarine Responses to Climate Change and Variability (Workshop Spring 2002).

We resampled 57 0.84‐m2 plots of an intertidal transect first surveyed by W. G. Hewatt at Hopkins Marine Station (HMS), Pacific Grove, California, between 1931 and 1933. Replicating precisely the location of the plots and methodology used by Hewatt, we documented changes in the abundances of 46 invertebrate species, indicating that this intertidal community changed significantly during the 60 yr between surveys. Changes in abundance were related to geographic ranges of species. Most southern species (10 of 11) increased in abundance, whereas most northern species (5 of 7) decreased. Cosmopolitan species showed no clear trend, with 12 increasing and 16 decreasing. Although Hewatt did not record algal species as thoroughly as invertebrates, we were able to document a massive decline in cover of Pelvetia compressa, a cosmopolitan fucoid alga that is typically more common in the southern part of its range. Shoreline ocean temperature, taken daily at HMS, warmed by 0.79°C during this 60‐yr period, with average summer temperatures up to 1.94°C warmer in the 13 yr preceding our study than in the 13 yr preceding Hewatt's. The hypothesis that climatic warming drove the observed range‐related community shifts is supported further by historical records and data from other investigators. Several alternative hypotheses to explain changes in the invertebrate community at HMS, including habitat changes, anthropogenic effects, indirect biological interactions, El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, and upwelling are considered to be less important than climate change. Changes in species' abundances over a short period (3 yr) were relatively small compared to large species shifts over 60 yr and were unrelated to geographic range of the species, indicating that short‐term population fluctuations play a relatively minor role in the long‐term community changes that we observed.","R.

Amphipods often comprise a major component of their invertebrate fauna and may be among the most important secondary producers. The life history and production of the amphipod Gammaropsis japonicus were investigated monthly for 1 year on a seagrass bed (Zostera marina L.) in Gwangyang Bay, southern Korea. Population density of G. japonicus was closely correlated with seagrass standing crop (P < 0.05), suggesting that there is a biological interaction between these two groups. The life-history pattern was annual and iteroparous with two principal periods of juvenile recruitment during the year; in spring (May to July) and fall (November to December). The mean body length of adults including ovigerous females was larger in the spring breeding period than in the fall and overall sex ratio was female-biased. The brood size and egg volume were positively related to body length of ovigerous females. At any given female size, egg volume was significantly larger in the fall breeding than in the spring, whereas brood size in the spring breeding was significantly larger than that in the fall. The brood volume of females between the two breeding periods was much greater in the fall than in the spring, suggesting higher reproductive effort during the fall breeding period. Annual biomass of G. japonicus was 2.16 g DW m−2 yr−1 and was higher in the spring than in the fall breeding periods. The annual secondary production (14.59 g DW m−2 yr−1) was higher than those observed for other amphipods inhabiting seagrass beds. However, annual productivity to biomass (P/B) ratio, at 6.74, was lower than those recorded previously in both temperate and tropical seagrass beds because the number of generations decreases the P/B ratio.

Modular construction alleviates constraints on biomass imposed by mechanical and energetic factors that are functions of the surface area to volume ratio. Colonies thus may grow large whilst preserving optimal modular dimensions. Among corals, optimal polyp size is smaller in the more autotrophic than in the more heterotrophic species. Modular construction allows flexibility of growth form, which can adapt to factors such as water currents, silting, light intensity and proximity of competitors. Modular colonies have great regenerative capacities, even separated fragments may survive and grow into new colonies. All fragments from a parental colony are genetically identical and large branching corals frequently undergo clonal propagation through fragmentation during storms. Soft corals can also fragment endogenously. By spreading the risk of mortality among independent units, the generation and dispersal of fragments lessens the likelihood of clonal extinction. In spite of their ability to propagate asexually, most benthic colonial animals also reproduce asexually. The selective advantages of the genetic diversity among sexually produced offspring seem not to be linked with dispersal, but probably lie in the biological interactions with competitors, predators and pathogens in the parental habitat. Age at first sexual maturity and the proportional investment of resources in sexual reproduction are related to colonial survivorship. Small branching corals on reef flats grow quickly, attain sexual maturity within 1–4 years, planulate extensively, but reach only small sizes before dying. Massive corals are longer lived and have the opposite characteristics of growth and reproduction. Most sessile reef organisms compete for space, food or light. Faster growers can potentially outcompete slower growers, but are often prevented from doing so by several forms of aggression from competitors and by the damage inflicted by storms. Competitive interactions among sedentary organisms on coral reefs are unlikely to be linear or deterministic, and so the co‐existence of diverse species is possible.",,,Biological Journal of the Linnean Society,,Oxford University Press (OUP),"0024-4066, 1095-8312",,1983-08,1983,2008-01-14,1983-08,20,1,39-58,Closed,Article,"HUGHES, R.

Darwin's naturalization hypothesis assessed on Mediterranean islands,"Aim Recent works have found the presence of native congeners to have a small effect on the naturalization rates of introduced plants, some suggesting a negative interaction (as proposed by Charles Darwin in The Origin of Species), and others a positive association. We assessed this question for a new biogeographic region, and discuss some of the problems associated with data base analyses of this type. Location Islands of the Mediterranean basin. Methods Presence or absence of congeners was assessed for all naturalized alien plants species at regional, local and habitat scales. Using general linear models, we attempted to explain the abundance of the species (as measured by the number of islands where recorded) from their congeneric status, and assessed whether the patterns could be alternatively accounted for by a range of biological, geographical and anthropogenic factors. A simulation model was also used to investigate the impact of a simple bias on a comparable but hypothetical data set. Results Data base analyses addressing Darwin's hypothesis are prone to bias from a number of sources. Interaction between invaders and congenerics may be overestimated, as they often do not co‐occur in the same habitats. Furthermore, intercorrelations between naturalization success and associated factors such as introduction frequency, which are also not independent from relatedness with the native flora, may generate an apparent influence of congenerics without implying a biological interaction. We detected no true influence from related natives on the successful establishment of alien species of the Mediterranean. Rarely‐introduced species tended to fare better in the presence of congeners, but it appears that this effect was generated because species introduced accidentally into highly invasible agricultural and ruderal habitats have many relatives in the region, due to common evolutionary origins. Main conclusions Relatedness to the native flora has no more than a marginal influence on the invasion success of alien plants in the Mediterranean, although apparent trends can easily be generated through artefacts of the data base.","This study was conducted as part of the EU project EPIDEMIE (http://www.ceh.ac.uk/EPIDEMIE).

A long‐term monitoring of snowmelt regimes in a Japanese alpine area revealed that the onset of the snowmelt season has been accelerated during the last 17 years in early snowmelt sites but that such a trend has not been detected in late snowmelt sites. This indicates that the global warming effect on the snowmelt pattern may be site‐specific. The flowering phenology of fellfield plants in an exposed wind‐blown habitat was consistent between an unusually warm year (1998) and a normal year (2001). In contrast, the flowering occurrence of snowbed plants varied greatly between the years depending on the snowmelt time. There was a large number of flowering species in the fellfield community from mid‐ to late to late June and from mid‐ to late July. The flowering peak of an early‐melt snowbed plant community was in the middle of the flowering season and that of a late‐melt snowbed community was in the early flowering season. These habitat‐specific phenological patterns were consistent between 1998 and 2001. The effects of the variation in flowering timing on seed‐set success were evaluated for an entomophilous snowbed herb, Peucedanum multivittatum, along the snowmelt gradient during a 5‐year period. When flowering occurred prior to early August, mean temperature during the flowering season positively influenced the seed set. When flowering occurred later than early August, however, the plants enjoyed high seed‐set success irrespective of temperature conditions if frost damage was absent. These observations are probably explained based on the availability of pollinators, which depends not only on ambient temperature but also on seasonal progress. These results suggest that the effects of climate change on biological interaction may vary depending on the specific habitat in the alpine ecosystem in which diverse snowmelt patterns create complicated seasonality for plants within a very localized area.",,,Population Ecology,,Wiley,"1438-3896, 1438-390X",,2005-12-08,2005,2005-12-08,2006-01,48,1,49-58,All OA; Green,Article,"Kudo, Gaku; Hirao, Akira S.","Kudo, Gaku (Graduate School of Environmental Earth Science, Hokkaido University, 060‐0810, Sapporo, Japan); Hirao, Akira S.

Bioavailability and tissue compartmentalisation of micro-essential metals (Cu, Zn, and Fe) were investigated in the bivalve Bathymodiolus azoricus from three geochemically distinct hydrothermal vents (Rainbow, Lucky Strike, Menez Gwen). Additionally, in order to make inferences on the effect of biological interactions on the metal uptake, the bivalves' endosymbiont bacteria and commensal parasite Branchipolynoe seepensis were analysed for metal bioaccumulation.Micro-essential metal concentrations in byssus threads exceeded many-fold concentrations in the gill and digestive gland, which in turn were consistently one order of magnitude above levels measured in the mantle. In spite of its high metal concentrations, the byssus is unlikely to be an active bioaccumulator. Its high surface to mass ratio and its binding sites for metals suggest a reversible adsorption of micro-essential metals in the vent mussel. Inter-site comparison showed highest Fe concentrations in tissues of mussels from the Rainbow site, whereas Zn and Cu in all tissues were highest in mussels from the Lucky Strike site, reflecting metal concentrations in the water surrounding macro-invertebrates at these vent sites.The omnipresence of the commensal parasite polychaete in gills of B. azoricus from the Lucky Strike vent field, unlike the other sites, is suggested to be an adaptation to the typically elevated Fe concentrations in the water column near mussel beds. Unprecedented Fe concentrations measured in the digestive gland of mussels from the Rainbow site (4000μg g−1, three times higher than levels in bivalves from polluted sites) call for further post-capture ecotoxicological investigations of potentially novel Fe-handling strategies.We provide the first information on the bioaccumulation potential of hydrothermal organisms by calculation of concentration factors for Cu, Zn and Fe in the gills of the bivalve host and also in its endosymbiont and/or parasites. Adaptation strategies (biochemical, physiological, morphological and life-history adaptations) of vent organisms to elevated levels of micronutrients and non-essential metallic elements are discussed.","This study was part of the SEAHMA project funded by the Foundation of Science and Technology, Portugal.

476,pub.1122018790,10.1111/1440-1703.12054,,,,Responses of daphnids and other zooplankton populations to massive fish kill in Lake Suwa,"In 2016, a massive fish kill of the planktivorous pond smelt Hypomesus nipponensis occurred in Lake Suwa, Japan. Pond smelt, which is important fish species from commercial and cultural perspectives, influences the zooplankton community in the lake. Following the massive fish kill, Daphnia galeata appeared and their population density increased to previously unseen levels by summer 2017. To help recover the fish population, larval pond smelt were released into the lake. Consequently, D. galeata has rarely appeared in Lake Suwa since summer 2017, except for a low‐density population observed in May–June 2018. These phenomena indicated that fish predation is a possible primary factor for suppressing daphnid populations in shallow eutrophic lake. Zooplankton populations showed species‐specific responses to the alterations in predation pressure. When the D. galeata population peaked after the fish kill event, rotifers, which are small‐sized competitors of daphnids, and calanoids tended to decrease in density. Rotifers then increased with the decrease in the daphnid populations due to the recovery of fish. Alternatively, cyclopoids, which demonstrated a similar population density following the fish kill event, tended to decrease when the fish population recovered. The population densities of Leptodora cf. kindtii/richardi and Bosmina spp. did not significantly differ between before the massive kill event and after pond smelt recovery. It is believed that the changes in zooplankton population densities observed in the present study may provide insights for further monitoring of aquatic food webs in eutrophic water systems, including Lake Suwa, where re‐oligotrophication is occurring and biological interactions are changing. During the routine monitoring of Lake Suwa in Japan, massive fish kill, especially the planktivorous pond smelt (Hypomesus nipponensis), occurred in 2016. In Lake Suwa, pond smelt has been known as an important predator regulating zooplankton community structure through direct and indirect predation impact. However, Daphnia galeata, which was not observed before massive fish kill, has emerged suddenly after the massive fish kill event and apparent changes in zooplankton community was expected. Therefore, we analyzed and briefly summarized the changes of zooplankton communities in a short time due to the mass kill of pond smelt and the appearance of D. galeata.",This study was supported in part by the JSPS KAKENHI for Scientific Research (C) to M.

476,pub.1069659246,10.2307/1935087,,,,Light‐Mediated Uptake of H‐Glucose in a Small Hard‐Water Lake,"This study examines the occurrence of photoheterotrophy, the light—mediated assimilation of organic compounds at or near natural substrate concentrations, in the phytoplankton of a lake. The pelagic zone of Lawrence Lake, an oligotrophic, dimictic, hard—water lake in southwestern Michigan, was selected as the study site because extensive information is already available on its carbon cycle. The uptake of glucose by the plankton was monitored in both light and dark bottles over an annual period. Uptake was measured during 3 sampling periods throughput the daylight hours (i.e., sunrise, midday, and sunset) and at 3 depths within the water column (i.e., 2, 6, and 10 metres). The patterns of dark heterotrophic activity, chemoheterotrophy, and light—mediated heterotrophic activity, photoheterotrophy, were significantly related to the variables of months, depths, and time of day. Chemoheterotrophic activity generally increased throughout the daylight period and with greater depth within the water column. Maximal values were generally observed during the sunset—incubation series and at 10 metres depth. Generally high and uniform activities with respect to depth were observed during periods of water circulation. Increasing activity at greater depth during the stratified summer period was also observed. Maximal values for photoheterotrophy were observed during spring circulation and late summer stratification. Activity was generally greatest below 2 metres and during morning and midday incubation periods. There was an apparent shift during the daylight period in the area of maximal uptake from 2 and 6 metres in the morning to 6 and 10 metres as the day progressed. Chemoheterotrophy and photoheterotrophy are both temporally and spatially separated with respect to activity within the water colum on a diurnal as well as a seasonal basis. The study revealed that dark bottle measurements of heterotrophic activity undrestimate total activity and can be justified as a means of assessing chemoheterotropich activity only. Light bottle uptake values averaged 146% of dark bottle estimates during the light period. Photocheterotrophy was shown to be quantitatively comparable to chemoheterotrophy within the pelagic zone. Photoassimilation averaged 67.6% of chemoheterotrophic activity based on individual comparisons (N = 360) over an annual period. Photoheterotrophy represents an important step in our further understanding of the cycling of carbon within aquatic systems and of biological interactions within the planktonic community.",,,Ecology,,Wiley,"0012-9658, 1939-9170",,1977-11,1977,,1977-11,58,6,1356-1365,Closed,Article,"McKinley, Kelton R.","McKinley, Kelton R.

Every three months during continuous three-day sampling, experimental gill nets (5 to 12.5 cm of mesh opening) and 1 mm-mesh seine nets were utilized according to the types of habitats presents. A total of 133 fish species were found in Las Arhuacas and 95 species in Cardonales. Fifty five and 17 species were exclusive to Las Arhuacas and Los Cardonales respectively, and 77 were common to both lagoons. In Las Arhuacas, the most speciesrich orders were Characiformes, Siluriformes, Perciformes and Gymnotiformes and in Los Cardonales, the most species-rich orders were Characiformes, Siluriformes, Clupeiformes and Perciformes. The richness, abundance and biomass were significantly higher (p < 0.001) in Arhuacas than in Cardonales. In general, the fishes assemblage was highly variable during the high water phase and moderately stable during low water phase in both lagoons, with more stability or less variability in Cardonales than Arhuacas. Also, there were significant differences in the fish assemblages between the two lagoons, mainly during low waters (ANOSIM; p < 0.001). The species that contributed most to the mean dissimilarity between the lagoons were Hypostomus argus, Aphanotorulus ammophilus, Potamorhina altamazonica, Prochilodus mariae, Loricaria gr. cataphracta, Oxydoras sifontesi, Hydrolycus armatus, Hyphopthalmus edentatus and Pterodoras rivasi. The last four species were more commonly collected in Los Cardonales. Also, the species of small size (mainly SL < 5 cm) such as Rhinosardinia amazonica, Moenkhausia sp. 1 ""lepidura"", Moenkhausia sp. 2, Aphyocharax alburnus, Characidium sp. 1, Moenkhausia sp. 3, Exodon paradoxus and Roeboides dientonito contributed to the mean dissimilarity among the beach and aquatic vegetation habitats. The patterns of the species assemblage organization were related to the dynamics of the floods. Non-random (i. e., deterministic) associations between species caused by the selection of habitats and/or to biological interactions, apparently were more common during low waters when there is an increased density of fish and so the biotic interactions are intensified. Stochastic associations, on the other hand, seemed to be more common during high water when species are more dispersed.",,,Neotropical Ichthyology,,FapUNIFESP (SciELO),"1679-6225, 1982-0224",,2009,2009,2010-01-18,2009,7,4,719-736,All OA; Gold,Article,"González, Nirson; Lasso, Carlos; Rosales, Judith","González, Nirson (San Félix, Fundación La Salle de Ciencias Naturales, Estación de Investigaciones Hidrobiológicas de Guayana, Venezuela; Estado Bolívar, Universidad Nacional Experimental de Guayana, Venezuela, nirson.gonzalez@fundacionlasalle.org.ve); Lasso, Carlos (Caracas, Fundación La Salle de Ciencias Naturales, Sección de Ictiología, Venezuela; Bogotá, D.C., Instituto de Investigación de Recursos Biológicos Alexander von Humboldt, Colombia, classo@humboldt.org.co); Rosales, Judith (Universidad Nacional Experimental de Guayana, Centro de Investigaciones Ecológicas, Venezuela, jrosales@uneg.edu.ve)",,"González, Nirson (Universidad Nacional Experimental de Guayana); Lasso, Carlos (Alexander von Humboldt Biological Resources Research Institute); Rosales, Judith (Universidad Nacional Experimental de Guayana)",Alexander von Humboldt Biological Resources Research Institute; Universidad Nacional Experimental de Guayana,grid.466790.a; grid.440751.3,Bogotá; Ciudad Bolívar,; ,Colombia; Venezuela,,,,,,3,0,,0.28,,https://www.scielo.br/j/ni/a/HyfgqbYyBwnvV8qMKttPq3y/?lang=en&format=pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1040786552,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,14 Life Below Water

This process, known as ecological intensification, will depend in large part on enhancing below‐ground biological interactions that facilitate resource use efficiency. Arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM), associations formed between the roots of most terrestrial plant species and a specialized group of soil fungi, provide valuable ecosystem services, but the full magnitude of these services may not be fully realized under conventional intensively managed annual agricultural systems. Here, we use meta‐analysis to assess how reducing soil disturbance and periods without roots in agricultural systems affect the formation of AM and the diversity and community composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). We compiled data from 54 field studies across five continents that measured effects of tillage and/or cover cropping on AMF colonization and/or communities and assessed effects of management and environmental factors on these responses. Less intensive tillage and winter cover cropping similarly increased AMF colonization of summer annual cash crop roots by ∼30%. The key variables influencing the change in AMF colonization were the type of cover crop or the type of alternative tillage, suggesting that farmers can optimize combinations of tillage and cover crops that most enhance AM formation, particularly with no‐till systems and legume cover crops. Richness of AMF taxa increased by 11% in low‐intensity vs. conventional tillage regimes. Several studies showed changes in diversity and community composition of AMF with cover cropping, but these responses were not consistent. Synthesis and applications. This meta‐analysis indicates that less intensive tillage and cover cropping are both viable strategies for enhancing root colonization from indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) across a wide range of soil types and cash crop species, and possibly also shifting AMF community structure, which could in turn increase biologically based resource use in agricultural systems.

Se pretende averiguar si estas caractersticas comunitarias se modifican o no sustantivamente entre aos. Se recolectaron un total de 26 taxa, a los que se les determin la prevalencia, aunque slo a 22 se les determin la abundancia.

Hay variaciones significativas entre aos en la composicin de las infracomunidades de parsitos pero no en la riqueza, abundancia, diversidad y dominancia. Aunque los antecedentes son escasos, la observada relativamente alta variabilidad composicional y baja variabilidad agregada es similar a lo encontrado en infracomunidades de parsitos, tanto de peces como de mamferos. Se discute la medida en que estos resultados representan compensacin o estasis comunitaria, entre cuyas causas podran estar las interacciones biolgicas The composition, richness, diversity, abundance and dominance in infracommunities of metazoan parasites found in 86 croaker Cilus gilberti (Abbott 1889) are compared between two samples taken off Talcahuano, Chile, with 15 years of difference. All hosts harboured parasites, and 26 taxa were collected. The prevalence of all taxa, and the abundance of 22 taxa were recorded. Most (69 %) taxa were found in both years. However, to compare between years, we just considered those 13 taxa occurring in at least 10 host individuals. Significant variations in composition but not in richness, abundance, diversity and dominance were found when infracommunities collected from croaker of similar body length were compared between years. Despite the fact that there are few antecedents on the subject, these results are similar to those reported in infracommunities of metazoan parasites of fishes and mammals in that there is high compositional variability and low aggregate variability.

One reach was located upstream of an intermittent tributary, and the other downstream. The purpose of the study was to chronicle long‐term dynamics and the effect of partial thermal restoration on invertebrate assemblages. The immediate hydrologic effect of the dam was a large decrease in annual maximum daily discharges, water temperatures, and sediment transport. Upstream of the intermittent tributary, macroinvertebrate genera declined from >70 to <30, and the mean macroinvertebrate density increased from 1000 to 10 000/m2 after dam closure. In 1978, a multilevel water intake structure was installed on the dam. Mean summer water temperatures increased from 6° to 12°C, and the number of annual degree days warmed from 2340 to 3200, which was similar to pre‐dam conditions; but the rate and timing of warming remained different than before the dam. In contrast to an expected increase in taxon richness, the number of taxa routinely collected after partial thermal restoration was similar to or lower than that observed before thermal restoration. Downstream of the intermittent tributary, taxon richness was about twice that found upstream after dam closure, and the mean annual per‐sample taxon richness increased from 7.6 to 11.0 following partial thermal restoration. In both reaches, invertebrate densities were near 10 000/m2 before and after thermal restoration. The lack of an appreciable increase in insect taxon richness upstream from an intermittent tributary following partial thermal restoration is likely due to the combined effects of three factors: (1) the competitive dominance of insect taxa by amphipods, (2) low rates of immigration and colonization, and (3) low reproductive success of insects due to a few degrees difference in the water temperatures between the regulated river and natural streams in the area. These results suggest that we should not only evaluate traditional habitat attributes, but biological interactions as well, when determining or monitoring the effects of river regulation on aquatic biota.","Financial and logistic support for this study was provided by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management.

476,pub.1106869825,10.3126/botor.v11i0.21033,,,,Variation of plant species richness at different spatial scales,"It is now realized that the variation in species richness is influenced by spatial and temporal scales. Pattern and scale are a central focus in ecology and biogeography. The species richness relationship depends on the scale of study and their correlated factors. The broad objective of this review is to elucidate how different scales are correlated with different explanatory variables to generate patterns of species richness. Addressing the problem of scale has both fundamental and applied importance in understanding variation in species richness along gradients. The understanding of pattern, its causes, and consequences is central to our understanding of processes such as succession, community development, and the spread and persistence of species. According to the hierarchical theory of species diversity there are mainly three categories of scales: local, landscape and regional. The local species richness or α-diversity is the diversity of individual stands. The β-diversity or species change is turnover between two elevational bands or between two plots or two sites. The regional or γ-diversity is the total richness of whole mountains or study systems and it has a combined influence from α- and β-diversity. The local species richness is affected by both local-scale processes (e.g., internal interactions) and broad-scale processes (e.g., evolutionary). Different explanatory variables according to the scales of study are necessary to explain variation at different spatial scales. Local factors (e.g., disturbance, grazing and tree cover) have been used to detect variation at a local scale. Generally, topographical factors are used to detect variation in species richness at a landscape scale; whereas climate, water-energy dynamics and historical processes are used to detect variation at a regional scale. However, it is not easy to separate strictly one scale from other because there is no clear boundary between them. The study of the whole elevation gradient from tropical to alpine zone or long latitude is a broad-scale study. The intermediate scale is a study on a local mountain, which covers the subtropical to warm temperate zones. To explain patterns of species richness, a pluralistic body of hypotheses, which incorporates historical, biological and climatic factors, is needed. This is depicted by the strong relationship between climate, biological interactions, and historical processes in influencing variation in species richness at different spatial scales.Botanica Orientalis – Journal of Plant Science (2017) 11: 49–62",,,Botanica Orientalis Journal of Plant Science,,Nepal Journals Online (JOL),1726-6858,,2018-09-07,2018,2018-09-07,,11,,49-62,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bhattarai, Khem Raj","Bhattarai, Khem Raj (Himalayan Resource and Development Centre, Nepal, GPO Box 7426, Kathmandu Sheridan, Hazel McCallion Campus, 4180 Duke of York Blvd, Mississauga, ON L5B 0G5, Canada)",,"Bhattarai, Khem Raj ()",,,,,,,,,,,8,6,,1.27,,https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/BOTOR/article/download/21033/17257,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1106869825,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4102 Ecological Applications,,,,,,C14 Geography and Environmental Studies,14 Life Below Water

According to Dayton and Hessler, nonselective predation reduces competition between species thereby allowing more species to coexist.Much controversy relating to the concept of diversity and what it implies can be resolved by realizing that an increase of within-habitat diversity is achieved by two entirely different and unrelated pathways. The resultant diversities are differentiated as follows: short-term, non-equilibrium, or transient diversity—induced by a low level or unpredictable physical or biological perturbation or stress resulting in biological ‘undersaturation’. Long-term or evolutionary diversity—increase in diversity is the product of past biological interactions in physical benign and predictable environments. Although predation may play a role in the evolution of deep-sea species, the life histories indicate that it does not seem a likely means for control of population size, regardless of whether predation is selective or non-selective. The known life history characteristics of deep-sea animals—small brood size, age-class structure not dominated by younger stages, probable slow growth rates—are features that neither would be expected nor have high survival value in predator-controlled communities or any environment where short-term or transient diversity is important. Non-selective cropping proposed by Dayton and Hessler as a mechanism for controlling population size of prey species would result in rapid extinction of species with relatively low reproductive rates.In addition to feeding behavior, niche diversification may be the product of biochemical specialization, biotic relationships and microhabitat specialization. Niche diversification may also result from adaptation to different parts of a temporal mosaic. The stability-time hypothesis does not state that disturbance plays no role in predictable environments. The relative predictability of the environment enables species to survive with lower reproductive rates, lower mortality rates, and smaller population size. Rates of competitive exclusion are lower and species are able to become more specialized on both biotic and physical components of the environment. Control of population size is seldom the result of changes in the physical environment or any disturbance, including predation, so that we may say that the community is biologically accommodated rather than physically regulated.",,,Deep Sea Research and Oceanographic Abstracts,,Elsevier,0011-7471,,1973-07,1973,,1973-07,20,7,643-659,Closed,Article,"Grassle, J.

476,pub.1146801919,10.25674/so94iss1id178,,,,Global monitoring of soil animal communities using a common methodology,"Here we introduce the Soil BON Foodweb Team, a cross-continental collaborative network that aims to monitor soil animal communities and food webs using consistent methodology at a global scale. Soil animals support vital soil processes via soil structure modification, consumption of dead organic matter, and interactions with microbial and plant communities. Soil animal effects on ecosystem functions have been demonstrated by correlative analyses as well as in laboratory and field experiments, but these studies typically focus on selected animal groups or species at one or few sites with limited variation in environmental conditions. The lack of comprehensive harmonised large-scale soil animal community data including microfauna, mesofauna, and macrofauna, in conjunction with related soil functions, microbial communities, and vegetation, limits our understanding of biological interactions in soil systems and how these interactions affect ecosystem functioning. To provide such data, the Soil BON Foodweb Team invites researchers worldwide to use a common methodology to address six long-term goals: (1) to collect globally representative harmonised data on soil micro-, meso-, and macrofauna communities, (2) to describe key environmental drivers of soil animal communities and food webs, (3) to assess the efficiency of conservation approaches for the protection of soil animal communities, (4) to describe soil food webs and their association with soil functioning globally, (5) to establish a global research network for soil biodiversity monitoring and collaborative projects in related topics, (6) to reinforce local collaboration networks and expertise and support capacity building for soil animal research around the world. In this paper, we describe the vision of the global research network and the common sampling protocol to assess soil animal communities and advocate for the use of standard methodologies across observational and experimental soil animal studies. We will use this protocol to conduct soil animal assessments and reconstruct soil food webs at sites associated with the global soil biodiversity monitoring network, Soil BON, allowing us to assess linkages among soil biodiversity, vegetation, soil physico-chemical properties, climate, and ecosystem functions. In the present paper, we call for researchers especially from countries and ecoregions that remain underrepresented in the majority of soil biodiversity assessments to join us. Together we will be able to provide science-based evidence to support soil biodiversity conservation and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems.",,,SOIL ORGANISMS,,,"1864-6417, 2509-9523",,2022-04,2022,,,94,1,55–68-55–68,Closed,Article,"Potapov, Anton M.; Sun, Xin; Barnes, Andrew D.; Briones, Maria J.; Brown, George G.; Cameron, Erin K.; Chang, Chih-Han; Cortet, Jerome; Eisenhauer, Nico; Franco, Andre L.C.; Fujii, Saori; Geisen, Stefan; Guerra, Carlos; Gongalsky, Konstantin; Haimi, Jari; Handa, I.

457,pub.1045146399,10.1016/0077-7579(91)90004-k,,,,The macrobenthos of the north sea,"The potential threat to the North Sea ecosystem due to pollution by organic and chemical wastes, has directed attention to the benthic assemblages in the sea. Because these assemblages comprise a wide range of ecological groups and species, many of which have a life span surpassing one year, they integrate effects of pollution over long periods of time. Knowledge on the spatial distribution of different types of assemblages allows assessment of the extension of possible effects over large areas.Analysis of the macrobenthos collected in the Dutch, German and Danish sectors of the North Sea during the synoptical ICES NORTH SEA BENTHOS SURVEY, showed that the samples from this area can be grouped into four clusters on the basis of macrofaunal similarity. Because the geographical distribution of the clusters correlated well with sediment characteristics and depth, for convenience the clusters can be described as shallow coarse- (medium-)sand, shallow fine-sand, shallow muddy-sand and deep muddy-sand. These four clusters differ not only with respect to species composition, diversity and biomass, but also with respect to their consumption and production of organic material. The differences between the structure and functioning of the clusters are interpreted in the light of local differences in the production and deposition of organic material and physical stress on the bottom.Because of the paucity of long-term series of observations, the important question as to whether the present situation shows signs of eutrophication cannot be addressed for the entire investigated area. In the German Bight, where nutrient levels have increased during the past decades and heavy algal blooms have been reported, the macrobenthic communities have not shown a major change. Even after mass mortality among benthic animals due to oxygen deficiency following the breakdown of algal blooms, the benthic community rapidly regained its former structure. This is explained by the dominance of physical factors in shaping the community of this shallow sand habitat. In the more protected muddy-sand habitats, on the other hand, similar events may lead to more permanent changes due to the importance of biological interactions. The available data from studies on the effects of single-point organic inputs on macrobenthic species can be used to predict the sort of changes that would take place in the case of large-scale eutrophication and can help to determine whether this is taking place.",,,Netherlands Journal of Sea Research,,Elsevier,0077-7579,,1991-11,1991,,1991-11,28,1-2,53-65,Closed,Article,"Duineveld, G.C.A.; Künitzer, A.; Niermann, U.; De Wilde, P.A.W.J.; Gray, John S.","Duineveld, G.C.A.

It is known that leaf segments of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica will increase photosynthesis with lowered pH, but it is not clear whether the outcome will be altered when the whole plant and its epiphyte community, with different respiratory and photosynthetic demands, are included. In addition, the effects on the Posidonia epiphyte community have rarely been tested under controlled conditions, at near‐future pH levels. In order to better evaluate the effects of pH levels as projected for the upcoming decades on seagrass meadows, shoots of P. oceanica with their associated epiphytes were exposed in the laboratory to three pH levels (ambient: 8.1, 7.7 and 7.3, on the total scale) for 4 weeks. Net productivity, respiration, net calcification and leaf fluorescence were measured on several occasions. At the end of the study, epiphyte community abundance and composition, calcareous mass and crustose coralline algae growth were determined. Finally, photosynthesis vs. irradiance curves (PE) was produced from segments of secondary leaves cleaned of epiphytes and pigments extracted. Posidonia leaf fluorescence and chlorophyll concentrations did not differ between pH treatments. Net productivity of entire shoots and epiphyte‐free secondary leaves increased significantly at the lowest pH level yet limited or no stimulation in productivity was observed at the intermediate pH treatment. Under both pH treatments, significant decreases in epiphytic cover were observed, mostly due to the reduction of crustose coralline algae. The loss of the dominant epiphyte producer yet similar photosynthetic response for epiphyte‐free secondary leaves and shoots suggests a minimal contribution of epiphytes to shoot productivity under experimental conditions. Synthesis. Observed responses indicate that under future ocean acidification conditions foreseen in the next century an increase in Posidonia productivity is not likely despite the partial loss of epiphytic coralline algae which are competitors for light. A decline in epiphytic cover could, however, reduce the feeding capacity of the meadow for invertebrates. In situ long‐term experiments that consider both acidification and warming scenarios are needed to improve ecosystem‐level predictions. Under ocean acidification conditions foreseen in the next century, an increase in productivity of Mediterranean seagrass Posidonia oceanica is not likely despite the partial loss of epiphytic coralline algae which are competitors for light. A decline in epiphytic cover could, however, reduce the feeding capacity of the meadow for invertebrates.","This work was funded by the EC FP7 projects ‘European Project on Ocean Acidification’ (EPOCA; grant agreement 211384) and ‘Mediterranean Sea Acidification in a changing climate’ (MedSeA; grant agreement 265103), and by the ‘European Free Ocean Carbon Enrichment’ project (eFOCE; BNP‐Paribas Foundation).

457,pub.1022415587,10.1007/s10530-006-9022-8,,,,Invasion of exotic earthworms into ecosystems inhabited by native earthworms,"The most conspicuous biological invasions in terrestrial ecosystems have been by exotic plants, insects and vertebrates. Invasions by exotic earthworms, although not as well studied, may be increasing with global commerce in agriculture, waste management and bioremediation. A number of cases has documented where invasive earthworms have caused significant changes in soil profiles, nutrient and organic matter dynamics, other soil organisms or plant communities. Most of these cases are in areas that have been disturbed (e.g., agricultural systems) or were previously devoid of earthworms (e.g., north of Pleistocene glacial margins). It is not clear that such effects are common in ecosystems inhabited by native earthworms, especially where soils are undisturbed. We explore the idea that indigenous earthworm fauna and/or characteristics of their native habitats may resist invasion by exotic earthworms and thereby reduce the impact of exotic species on soil processes. We review data and case studies from temperate and tropical regions to test this idea. Specifically, we address the following questions: Is disturbance a prerequisite to invasion by exotic earthworms? What are the mechanisms by which exotic earthworms may succeed or fail to invade habitats occupied by native earthworms? Potential mechanisms could include (1) intensity of propagule pressure (how frequently and at what densities have exotic species been introduced and has there been adequate time for proliferation?); (2) degree of habitat matching (once introduced, are exotic species faced with unsuitable habitat conditions, unavailable resources, or unsuited feeding strategies?); and (3) degree of biotic resistance (after introduction into an otherwise suitable habitat, are exotic species exposed to biological barriers such as predation or parasitism, “unfamiliar” microflora, or competition by resident native species?). Once established, do exotic species co-exist with native species, or are the natives eventually excluded? Do exotic species impact soil processes differently in the presence or absence of native species? We conclude that (1) exotic earthworms do invade ecosystems inhabited by indigenous earthworms, even in the absence of obvious disturbance; (2) competitive exclusion of native earthworms by exotic earthworms is not easily demonstrated and, in fact, co-existence of native and exotic species appears to be common, even if transient; and (3) resistance to exotic earthworm invasions, if it occurs, may be more a function of physical and chemical characteristics of a habitat than of biological interactions between native and exotic earthworms.","This project was supported by the National Research Initiative of the USDA Co-operative State Research, Education and Extension Service, grant number 2003-35107-13876, and by National Science Foundation grant number 0236276 to the University of Georgia Research Foundation, Inc.",,Biological Invasions,,Springer Nature,"1387-3547, 1573-1464",,2006-09-01,2006,2006-09-01,2006-09,8,6,1287-1300,All OA; Green,Article,"Hendrix, P.

Fish from Canche, Authie and Somme estuaries were collected during spring (June 2006 and May 2007) and autumn (September 2006) along the estuarine gradients using a 1.5m beam trawl. Using identical sampling protocols, the study also analysed and compared for the first time taxonomic and functional aspects of the fish assemblages in 15 estuaries located along the Atlantic and English Channel coasts. SIMPER analysis showed high similarities in fish assemblages in the three EEC estuaries and during either spring or autumn periods. However, intra-estuary similarities were relatively low, indicating that fish assemblage structures (species richnesses or abundances) were more variable within the estuary (salinity gradient) than between estuaries and/or seasons (spring vs autumn). Although numerous environmental variables were included in the study, only 47% of the variability observed in the fish distribution was explained. Fish spatial variations in the EEC estuaries are mostly driven by abiotic variables as opposed to biological interactions. As indicated by CCA, salinity and muddy sediments were the two most important factors structuring the fish assemblages. The macrobenthos being very abundant in the EEC estuaries (580–1121ind. m−2), the availability of potential prey is probably not a limiting factor in the utilization of estuaries by fish. Contrary to the majority of French estuaries dominated by estuarine species (ES), the fish assemblages of the EEC estuaries are clearly dominated by marine migrant (MM) species (65% on average) with high abundance of juveniles (mostly young-of-the-year). Cluster and SIMPROF's analyses distinguished the functional structure of the 15 estuarine fish assemblages into different clusters. The three EEC estuaries form a similar group with the largest French estuaries (Seine, Loire and Gironde). The latters were characterized by higher MM/ES ratio compared to the other French estuaries. Freshwater flow and tidal range were the main factors associated with this group of estuaries. The results of the present study do not indicate that anthropogenic impacts (chemical contamination) on estuaries affect their ecological functioning as described by the fish ecological guilds. It is suggested that the guild approach may not be useful to provide valuable information on the ecological status of estuaries.","This study was supported by the French National Program LITEAU 2, directed by the French Ministry for the Environment.

In this study, the number of species, density and biomass were evaluated as a function of the moon. A total of 49 species distributed in 24 families were captured in two areas of Miramar beach. The mean density was significant high in the weaning and low in the new moon, while density and biomass together showed differences for areas. The most abundant species were Anchoa tricolor and Trachinotus falcatus (new moon), and Anchovia clupeoides showed significant differences in the waning moon. The RDA indicates that turbidity influenced significantly the presence of two species group. The group I were represented by Stellifer brasiliensis, Trachinotus goodei, A. clupeoides, Chilomycterus spinosus and Conodon nobilis that occurred on the waning and new phases in both areas, while the group II were represented by Polydactylus virginicus and Haemulopsis corvinaeformis in the full moon. The surf zones may also be strongly governed by the lunar phases. Therefore, the results found in this study, showed that the biological interactions between the species with turbidity and moon might explain the density and biomass variations for some species in the surf zone.
RESUMO A influência das fases lunares sobre a ictiofauna tem sido pouco estudada na zona de arrebentação. Nesse estudo, foram avaliadas, o número de espécies, densidade e a biomassa da ictiofauna em função da lua. Foram capturadas 49 espécies distribuídas em 24 famílias em duas áreas na Praia de Miramar. A densidade foi significativamente elevada nas luas minguante e nova. Além disso, a densidade e biomassa juntas mostraram diferenças entre as áreas. As espécies mais abundantes na lua nova foram Anchoa tricolor e Trachinotus falcatus, e Anchovia clupeoides teve uma maior abundancia na lua minguante. O RDA, indicou que a turbidez influenciou significativamente a presença de dois grupos distintos. O grupo I, representado por Stellifer brasiliensis, Trachinotus goodei, A. clupeoides, Chilomycterus spinosus e Conodon nobilis estiveram presentes nas luas minguante e nova em ambas as áreas, e o grupo II, representado por Polydactylus virginicus e Haemulopsis corvinaeformis na lua cheia. As zonas de arrebentação também podem ser reguladas fortemente pelas fases lunares. Os resultados mostraram que as interações biológicas entre as espécies com a turbidez e as fases lunares podem explicar as variações de densidade e biomassa para algumas espécies na zona de arrebentação.","We particularly thank Jonas de Assis Almeida Ramos for their invaluable assistance with fieldwork, species identification and statistical analysis.

457,pub.1035614208,10.1111/1365-2745.12713,,,,Non‐stationarity in the co‐occurrence patterns of species across environmental gradients,"Quantifying the role of biotic interactions in driving community assembly often relies on analysing species co‐occurrence patterns, where segregated patterns are taken to indicate antagonistic interactions such as competition. It is unknown, however, if co‐occurrence patterns are stationary across environmental gradients, as it is possible that the strength of biotic interactions that drive these patterns also depends on the environment. In this study, we aim to understand how patterns of co‐occurrence change when species move from their environmental range centre towards their range periphery while isolating the potential signal of biotic interactions from confounding factors. We used two separate statistical approaches (null models and joint species distribution models) to quantify pairwise co‐occurrence patterns for tree species sampled in 9382 plots distributed across the conterminous US. We also analysed co‐occurrence patterns that emerged from a simple meta‐community model. We then assessed how patterns of species segregation and aggregation change in relation to habitat suitability while accounting for multiple factors known to confound co‐occurrence analyses. We found strong non‐stationarity in co‐occurrences, with patterns shifting from segregated at the environmental range centre towards aggregated at range margins for the majority of tree species. Patterns were in full agreement between model simulations and both empirical analyses. Model simulations suggest that this pattern is at least partly driven by variation in the relative abundances of non‐focal species even when no direct biological interactions are present. Synthesis. Patterns of tree species co‐occurrence vary across environmental gradients, with increased segregation when environmental conditions are optimal and increased aggregation when the environment is less suitable. This pattern may originate from a trade‐off between the abundance of the focal species pair, which decreases towards the environmental range margin, and the increasing abundance of non‐focal species to which the environment is more suitable. The strong dependence of co‐occurrence patterns on environmental conditions might limit the predictive ability of joint species distribution models, which couple species co‐occurrences and their environmental responses, because co‐occurrence patterns and environmental responses are confounded. Patterns of tree species co‐occurrence vary across environmental gradients, with increased segregation when environmental conditions are optimal and increased aggregation when the environment is less suitable. The strong dependence of co‐occurrence patterns on environmental conditions might limit the predictive ability of joint models, which couple species co‐occurrences and their environmental responses, because co‐occurrence patterns and environmental responses are confounded.","We thank Richard A.

We compared the dynamics of natural and experimentally constructed mussel patches (Mytilus trossulus and M. edulis) in two intertidal habitats, tidepools and emergent rock, over a time series (5, 10, 15 mo) and among seasons (three successive 5‐mo intervals). In tidepools, mussels naturally occurred in small patches (median <25 cm2). In contrast, mussels on emergent rock formed extensive beds with decimeter‐scale gaps, but these beds start as small patches following disturbance such as ice scour. For our experimental patches (15 cm2) in both habitats, we assessed the relative importance of physical (wave disturbance) and biological (predation, growth, recruitment, and immigration) processes in determining patch size and structure. Although individual experimental and natural patches varied greatly in size over time, mean patch area remained relatively constant. In general, mean size of individuals in experimental patches decreased due to the loss of larger mussels while numbers increased due to recruitment. Wave disturbance, which removes and redistributes mussels, appeared to be more important than predation (by the whelk Nucella lapillus) in determining patch structure and dynamics on this shore, although losses due to either process did not differ consistently between habitats over time. Individual growth rates were low (shell length ≤0.4 mm/mo) but greater in tidepools than on emergent rock, whereas recruitment and immigration rates generally did not differ between habitats. Although each process contributed to changes in patch size and structure, collectively they did not result in a marked divergence in mean patch area or biomass between tidepools and emergent rock over the 15‐mo experiment. We suggest that the broad patterns of distribution and abundance of mussels develop slowly on this shore largely because of low individual growth rates. Over time scales of years, however, positive relationships between individual growth and recruitment rates and patch size may accelerate the expansion of aggregations on emergent rock. Mussel assemblages at our site differ from those examined in many other studies in terms of the relative importance of wave dislodgment and predation as causes of loss and in the role of growth in offsetting these losses. This study shows how integrative approaches, with monitoring of patches and individuals within patches, can provide detailed mechanistic understanding of patch structure and dynamics.","We thank Michael Gedamke, Shelley Lang, and Kristina Sander for assistance in the field and Norman Countway for constructing the wave meters.

Fungi can be used as bioindicators because they are highly sensitive to alterations in their surroundings, thus being useful for monitoring ecological changes and effects of human activity on natural ecosystems. Nothofagus alpina (raulí) is an ecologically and economically important species of South American temperate forests. It is currently included in domestication and conservation programs, and provenance trials have been installed in different ecosystems of Patagonia. These trials are ideal for studying how tree genetics might influence the associated microbiota. Afforestation with fast-growing exotic conifers (mainly Pinus ponderosa) had been promoted as an important economic activity in Patagonia, but nowadays there is an increasing interest for the establishment of mix Pinus + Nothofagus plantations instead of monospecific Pinus stands and for using Pinus plantations as refugee for assisted Nothofagus migration. The main objective of this work was to explore the structure of different fungal communities in the rhizosphere of N. alpina with different genetic diversity (high, intermediate, and low) implanted under a native Nothofagus forest and a P. ponderosa plantation. Fingerprinting based on Temperature Gradient Gel Electrophoresis revealed differences in the structure of the rhizosphere fungal communities. Some relationships between N. alpina genetic diversity and composition of rhizosphere fungal communities were observed. In the native forest, one of the provenances (intermediate genetic diversity) was associated with the highest richness of Basidiomycetes and total fungi. In addition, individual genetic parameters of N. alpina specimens implanted in the native forest significantly correlated with Ascomycetes richness. It was also found that Basidiomycetes were the dominating fungal taxa in the native forest, and Ascomycetes in the P. ponderosa plantation. Factors as soil physicochemical characteristics and the dominant forestry species, which provide different quantity and quality of litter inputs and are associated with different ectomycorrhizal fungi, seemed to be the main factors determining this significant difference between the native forest and the plantation. Beyond highlighting the potential of applying soil fungi as bioindicators, our study contributes to understanding the relationship between host genetics and rhizosphere fungi. This information is relevant not only for conservation and restoration programs, but also for taking management decisions related with sustainable forestry and domestication of native tree species.","We gratefully acknowledge funding from National Research Council (CONICET), Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica (PICT 2018-4029) and Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Agropecuaria (PNFOR 1104063).

Sampling was done for 6 years at six sites spanning over 4° of latitude in California. Ten 1×2-m permanent plots were chosen in the central portion of the assemblage at each site. Four of these served as unmanipulated controls, three were cleared (scraped and burned) in the spring of 1985, and three were cleared in the fall of 1985. The cover of sessile and density of motile species were determined by subsampling within the plots from 1985 until 1991. Recovery of the clearings was determined by their similarity to the controls. The algae E. muricata, M. papillatus, and Fucus gardneri, and the barnacle Balanus glandula, were the most abundant sessile organisms in the control plots, although the latter never exceeded 12% cover at any site. The grazing gastropods Littorina scutulata/plena, various limpets, and Tegula funebralis were the most common mobile organisms. The species composition of the common species remained constant in the control plots over the study period and there were few large changes in relative abundance. Significant seasonal variation was detected in 11 species but variation was commonly site-specific.Ephemeral algae were abundant during early succession at only two of the six sites, and barnacle cover was low (<15% cover) at four sites and moderate (15–50% cover) at the remaining two throughout succession. Recovery rate varied considerably among sites and between times of clearing (1–10%/month). Correlations between ephemeral algae and grazer abundance, and between these variables and recovery rate were not significant. The effects of grazers on recovery rate were only evident at one site where they appeared to reduce an initially high cover of ephemeral algae and delay the establishment of perennials. Some of the largest differences in recovery rate were between clearing times, associated with differences in the phenology of the dominant perennial algae. In spite of these differences, most plots recovered by the end of the study period.These results indicate that the assemblages in the control plots at each site were relatively stable and, while successional pathways and processes varied, the assemblage at most sites still recovered. Current models, based largely on biological interactions, that attempt to explain within assemblage structure and succession were not broadly applicable.","We thank A. De Vogelaere and C.

These levels were at heights on the shore where the upper or lower boundaries of distribution of a number of species coincided. Critical levels were correlated with heights on the shore where there were changes in the rate of change, with height, of the annual proportion of the time spent emersed. This was calculated from predicted tide tables. One implications of this was that different assemblages of intertidal species were present between particular levels on the shore. Futhermore, this hypothesis depended on patterns of vertical distribution of several species being identically controlled by physical factors associated with the rise and fall of the tide. This conflicts with more recent hypotheses, based upon experimental evidence, which include the effects of biological interactions among species on their patterns of distribution.The methods of calculation of the annual emersion curve were approximate, with a high degree of extrapolation. The hypothesis that critical levels exist has not been quantitatively tested.New, more accurate calculations of the emersion curve, from predicted tidal heights, indicate a smooth, monotonic curve against height on the shore. This eliminates the possibility of correlation between the coincident boundaries of distribution of a group of species and a height at which the curve changes in slope.The upper and lower boundaries of species were recorded in transects on five shores in different parts of Britain. If critical level exist, the upper or lower boundaries of a set of species must depart from random dispersion up and down the shore, to be clumped or aggregated at the critical levels. A test for non-random dispersion of the boundaries indicated no significant departure from random on any of the shores sampled.There is thus no evidence that critical tidal levels exist, because there is no evidence that the upper, or lower, boundaries of vertical distribution of intertidal species are in any way aggregated. There is no possibility of correlation between changes of slope of the emersion curve at particular heights on the shore and the patterns of distribution of intertidal species on British shores. The hypothesis of critical tidal levels must be abandoned and the rôle of the effects of tidal rise and fall on the vertical distribution of intertidal species must be re-examined in any new hypotheses to account for observed patterns of zonation.",,,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology,,Elsevier,"0022-0981, 1879-1697",,1978-01,1978,,1978-01,33,3,261-276,Closed,Article,"Underwood, A.J.","Underwood, A.J.

456,pub.1051130092,10.1608/frj-7.1.789,,,,"Fresh Waters, Climate Change and UK Nature Conservation","The literature on ecological effects of recent climate change in fresh waters has been reviewed, with particular reference to freshwater conservation in the UK. Least emphasis is given to predictive models of future change, because of considerable uncertainties even in the climate models, let alone their biological implications. Climate change effects on fresh waters have been superimposed on existing large human impacts, which make separation of climatic effects particularly difficult. Research in fresh waters has concentrated on communities and processes and there is less emphasis on individual charismatic species than in terrestrial systems. This approach lends itself to space-for-time studies on climate effects. There has been a modest amount of experimentation, particularly in mesocosms, and analysis of long-term biological data sets, the most extensive from lakes. The most detailed information on ecological effects comes from lake plankton. No species is yet known to have been lost from the UK as a result of climate change but there is extensive evidence of changes in phenology and distribution, and in processes in the plankton. It is likely that temperature effects per se will be less important than effects of changed hydrology and that idiosyncratic behaviour of each species will lead to many indirect effects through biological interactions in communities. Experimental studies suggest major likely changes in plant, fish and invertebrate communities with a several degree increase in temperature and associated hydrological changes expected in the 21st century. Freshwater organisms, however, are well adapted to disturbance and through invasion, redistribution, adaptation and microevolution will re-form functioning communities, though with likely different biodiversity than at present. Some invasive species may come to dominate the new communities. There will be important consequences for the estimation of ecological quality, which will inconvenience statutory obligations under the Water Framework Directive, and symptoms of eutrophication will be exacerbated. Some coastal lakes may revert to estuaries. Much more important, however, may be the consequences of climate change for the important part of the carbon cycle that is focussed on fresh waters, particularly if the ratio of community respiration to gross primary production increases with rising temperature. Several studies suggest large increases in this ratio with temperature rises of up to 4 C. A much more radical approach to conservation, involving re-establishment of entire, connected catchment systems rather than the present piecemeal attention to biodiversity issues is likely to be needed if a comfortable human future is to be guaranteed.","The original version of this paper was written to support the Terrestrial Biodiversity Climate Change Report Card, http://www.lwec.org.uk/resources/report-cards/biodiversity, which has been produced to summarise the latest scientific evidence and understanding of how climate change is affecting UK biodiversity.

Considerable year‐to‐year variation in temperature and precipitation occurred during the 10‐yr study (1983–1992), with most extreme hot‐dry conditions in 1988 during a 3‐yr drought. Decreased stream temperature and reduced variation in temperature occurred downstream from the lake outlet because of increased groundwater inputs. Age‐0 bass were captured in the stream in each of the eight years sampled, but bass abundance peaked in downstream reaches in 1988, concurrent with a large increase in the downstream density of age‐0 chubs. Median length ratio of bass to chubs increased greatly in the 1988 drought year. The shift in relative length of bass and chubs during the drought was because chub length decreased in downstream areas, and bass shifted from feeding on invertebrates to feeding on chubs in downstream but not in upstream reaches. Comparison of bass and chub growth in the presence and absence of interspecific competition for invertebrate resources in an experimental stream revealed higher growth rates for chubs than for bass and little interspecific competition. Experiments in the artificial stream indicated that the presence or absence of chubs susceptible to bass predation had only marginal effects on bass survival, but growth rates of bass were substantially higher if chubs susceptible to predation were present. Only when chubs were present was the growth of individual bass dependent strongly on size, and this led to rapid divergence in the size distribution of bass in chubs vs. no‐chubs treatments. Our results indicate that hot‐dry climatic conditions associated with drought have potentially strong effects on size‐structured trophic interactions between age‐0 fish along lake–stream gradients. Hot‐dry climatic conditions alter the spatial distribution of lake fish along temperature gradients in the stream, the reproductive success and synchrony of lake and stream fish development, and the eventual growth of predatory lake species. The response of fish to climatic variation appears to be strongly influenced by their position in the “hydrologic landscape.” The most dramatic fish response occurred in stream reaches influenced by groundwater.","Numerous people helped with this research over the years, often under difficult field conditions.

The two sequences consist of the late Miocene Arroyo Bellaco reef of the Cibao Valley, northern Dominican Republic, and the late Pleistocene 125-ka reef terrace of the southern Dominican Republic. Samples were collected along 20-meter transects (10 Miocene, 10 Pleistocene); species identifications were made using standard sets of characters and morphometrics. In particular, species of Montastraea annularis-like corals were distinguished within each sequence using a 2-dimensional landmark technique involving average linkage cluster analysis, discriminant analyses, and non-parametric tests. Four Miocene and four Pleistocene species were recognized. Subsequent community analysis was two-fold: (1) whole coral community, and 2) distribution of the Montastraea annularis complex. For the whole coral community, occurrence matrices of transect samples, assembled separately for Miocene (35 species) and Pleistocene (20 species) reef sequences, were analyzed using average linkage cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling, similarity percentages, one-way analysis of similarity, and non-parametric tests for independent samples (Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis H). Three assemblages were recognized within each sequence, which correspond with back-reef, reef-crest, and reef-front facies defined independently on the basis of sedimentological criteria. Comparisons between the two sequences suggest that widespread species (ecological generalists) are more common within the Pleistocene sequence than within the Miocene sequence. Fifteen of thirty-five (43) Miocene species occur in single reef facies compared to five of twenty (25) Pleistocene species. Of the five species found within both reef sequences, four occur in all three of the identified Miocene reef facies; one was found in two of these three facies. For the distribution of the Montastraea annularis complex, samples of M. annularis-like corals were examined to determine if distributional patterns of species within the complex were similar before and after faunal turnover. The four M. annularis-like corals identified within each reef sequence had markedly different distributional patterns. During the late Miocene, cohabitation within reef facies was low. Following faunal turnover, cohabitation within facies increased. This result further suggests that niche partitioning may have been reduced on post-turnover reefs. The results support the hypothesis of selective extinction of ecologically restricted species during Plio-Pleistocene turnover. Despite the prolonged and continuous nature of faunal turnover, reef community change involved more than species replacementthe underlying structure of reef communities and their biological interactions were fundamentally altered.","We are grateful to the following people for their help and support during this research: Dr. John Pandolfi for instruction on quantitative surveying and non-parametric techniques as well as very helpful reviews of the manuscript; Dr. Jonathan Adrain and Dr. Phil Heckel, for helpful comments and suggestions during the early editorial process; Steven Wallace and John Dawson, for their insightful conversations and technical assistance; Quinn Brown, for help with field collections; and Kay Saville, for help with thin sections.

439,pub.1031081561,10.1007/s10750-006-0507-3,,,,Restoration of shallow lakes by nutrient control and biomanipulation—the successful strategy varies with lake size and climate,"Major efforts have been made world-wide to improve the ecological quality of shallow lakes by reducing external nutrient loading. These have often resulted in lower in-lake total phosphorus (TP) and decreased chlorophyll a levels in surface water, reduced phytoplankton biomass and higher Secchi depth. Internal loading delays recovery, but in north temperate lakes a new equilibrium with respect to TP often is reached after <10–15 years. In comparison, the response time to reduced nitrogen (N) loading is typically <5 years. Also increased top-down control may be important. Fish biomass often declines, and the percentage of piscivores, the zooplankton:phytoplankton biomass ratio, the contribution of Daphnia to zooplankton biomass and the cladoceran size all tend to increase. This holds for both small and relatively large lakes, for example, the largest lake in Denmark (40 km2), shallow Lake Arresø, has responded relatively rapidly to a ca. 76% loading reduction arising from nutrient reduction and top-down control. Some lakes, however, have proven resistant to loading reductions. To accelerate recovery several physico-chemical and biological restoration methods have been developed for north temperate lakes and used with varying degrees of success. Biological measures, such as selective removal of planktivorous fish, stocking of piscivorous fish and implantation or protection of submerged plants, often are cheap versus traditional physico-chemical methods and are therefore attractive. However, their long-term effectiveness is uncertain. It is argued that additional measures beyond loading reduction are less cost-efficient and often not needed in very large lakes. Although fewer data are available on tropical lakes these seem to respond to external loading reductions, an example being Lake Paranoá, Brazil (38 km2). However, differences in biological interactions between cold temperate versus warm temperate-subtropical-tropical lakes make transfer of existing biological restoration methods to warm lakes difficult. Warm lakes often have prolonged growth seasons with a higher risk of long-lasting algal blooms and dense floating plant communities, smaller fish, higher aggregation of fish in vegetation (leading to loss of zooplankton refuge), more annual fish cohorts, more omnivorous feeding by fish and less specialist piscivory. The trophic structures of warm lakes vary markedly, depending on precipitation, continental or coastal regions locations, lake age and temperature. Unfortunately, little is known about trophic dynamics and the role of fish in warm lakes. Since many warm lakes suffer from eutrophication, new insights are needed into trophic interactions and potential lake restoration methods, especially since eutrophication is expected to increase in the future owing to economic development and global warming.","We thank the Danish counties for access to data from the Survey Programme of Danish Lakes.

The two sequences consist of the late Miocene Arroyo Bellaco reef of the Cibao Valley, northern Dominican Republic, and the late Pleistocene 125-ka reef terrace of the southern Dominican Republic. Samples were collected along 20-meter transects (10 Miocene, 10 Pleistocene); species identifications were made using standard sets of characters and morphometrics. In particular, species of Montastraea annularis-like corals were distinguished within each sequence using a 2-dimensional landmark technique involving average linkage cluster analysis, discriminant analyses, and non-parametric tests. Four Miocene and four Pleistocene species were recognized. Subsequent community analysis was two-fold: (1) whole coral community, and 2) distribution of the Montastraea “annularis” complex.For the whole coral community, occurrence matrices of transect samples, assembled separately for Miocene (35 species) and Pleistocene (20 species) reef sequences, were analyzed using average linkage cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling, similarity percentages, one-way analysis of similarity, and non-parametric tests for independent samples (Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis H). Three assemblages were recognized within each sequence, which correspond with back-reef, reef-crest, and reef-front facies defined independently on the basis of sedimentological criteria. Comparisons between the two sequences suggest that widespread species (ecological generalists) are more common within the Pleistocene sequence than within the Miocene sequence. Fifteen of thirty-five (43%) Miocene species occur in single reef facies compared to five of twenty (25%) Pleistocene species. Of the five species found within both reef sequences, four occur in all three of the identified Miocene reef facies; one was found in two of these three facies.For the distribution of the Montastraea “annularis” complex, samples of M. annularis-like corals were examined to determine if distributional patterns of species within the complex were similar before and after faunal turnover. The four M. annularis-like corals identified within each reef sequence had markedly different distributional patterns. During the late Miocene, cohabitation within reef facies was low. Following faunal turnover, cohabitation within facies increased. This result further suggests that niche partitioning may have been reduced on post-turnover reefs.The results support the hypothesis of selective extinction of ecologically restricted species during Plio-Pleistocene turnover. Despite the prolonged and continuous nature of faunal turnover, reef community change involved more than species replacement–the underlying structure of reef communities and their biological interactions were fundamentally altered.","We are grateful to the following people for their help and support during this research: Dr. John Pandolfi for instruction on quantitative surveying and non-parametric techniques as well as very helpful reviews of the manuscript; Dr. Jonathan Adrain and Dr. Phil Heckel, for helpful comments and suggestions during the early editorial process; Steven Wallace and John Dawson, for their insightful conversations and technical assistance; Quinn Brown, for help with field collections; and Kay Saville, for help with thin sections.

439,pub.1136023858,10.3897/aca.4.e64824,,,,Keystone species of coastal ecosystems from the Bay of Biscay,"Estuarine and coastal ecosystems play a fundamental role in human activities. Since millions of people depend on the numerous resources they offer (i.e., fisheries, transportation, and recreational activities), these ecosystems are also exposed to a high anthropogenic pressure. In order to better monitor and regulate such pressures, it is critical to improve our understanding of the functioning of these ecosystems. This is especially important for microorganisms, considering, for instance, their important roles in biogeochemical cycles. In this study we investigate estuarine and coastal microbial communities along the coast of the Basque Country using eDNA metabarcoding of bacterioplankton and microbenthos samples along a time series, from locations that present different degrees of disturbance. Metabarcoding of the 16S and 18S rRNA gene was carried out, and the OTU and taxa tables generated were used to reconstruct ecological networks, representing potential biological interactions. These ecological networks were used to identify on one hand the species that play a major role in the maintenance of the whole community structure (keystones), and on the other, complex network modules affected by environmental impacts. Here, we define keystone taxa as those that presented the highest ratio between the degree of connectivity (number of associations they established within the network) and their relative abundance. The underlying aim of this study is to develop novel “bioindicators” based on taxa that are both sensitive to impacts and important for community structure.  Results of two seawater communities, one from offshore waters and the other from the coast, showed similar bacterial composition at family level, dominated by Flavobacteraceae and Rhodobacteraceae. Nevertheless, their ecological network properties differed strongly: for a similar number of taxa that established associations, the conectance was similar in both communities, but the number of associations in the coastal community was twice as high as for the offshore one, resulting in a higher modularity. Identified keystone taxa were taxonomically different between both communities: those from the coastal community belonged to Protobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Fusobacteria phyla, while the keystones from the offshore community belonged to Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Thaumarchaeota, PAUC34f and Verrucomicrobia. Moreover, we identified “connector” taxa that presented the highest values of betweenness centrality. These taxa, without having a high degree of connectivity, may be important for the interaction structure because they connect modules, i.e., highly connected subnetworks within the whole network. Further, hierarchical clustering was performed to identify seasonal trends and to better understand the associations retrieved. Taxa with different seasonal preference often grouped together in the same modules, which indicates that modularity was not caused primarily by seasonality.",,,ARPHA Conference Abstracts,,Pensoft Publishers,2603-3925,,2021-03-04,2021,2021-03-04,,4,,e64824,All OA; Gold,Article,"Garate, Leire; Lanzén, Anders","Garate, Leire (Fundación AZTI Fundazioa, Donostia-San Sebastián, Spain, Fundación AZTI Fundazioa, Donostia-San Sebastián, Spain); Lanzén, Anders (Fundación AZTI Fundazioa, Donostia-San Sebastián, Spain, Fundación AZTI Fundazioa, Donostia-San Sebastián, Spain)","Garate, Leire (Tecnalia)","Garate, Leire (Tecnalia); Lanzén, Anders (Tecnalia)",Tecnalia,grid.13753.33,San Sebastian,,Spain,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,3,https://aca.pensoft.net/article/64824/download/pdf/,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136023858,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3107 Microbiology; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,14 Life Below Water

This contradictory evidence led us to carefully review the data and results of several of those papers that failed to find latitudinal gradients in rates of seagrass herbivory. To re-evaluate the arguments around the presence or absence of latitudinal gradients in herbivory in seagrass, we began by expanding the selection criteria to include more studies to compare the published latitudinal range of seagrass occurrences with the latitudes in which seagrass herbivory has been studied. We also compared the latitudinal range of known seagrass herbivores with the distribution of studies on seagrass herbivory. Finally, we investigated studies that provided seasonal data on net primary production and standing stock of seagrasses, which allowed an assessment of the relative amounts of production that could enter the seagrass grazing food web among latitudes and climatic regimes. Consistent with recent meta-analyses, we found little latitudinal effect on grazing rates. However, we argue that the following factors are likely to confound these findings and potentially mask latitudinal trends in seagrass herbivory: (1) the paucity of data available to test latitudinal trends in grazing rates at high latitudes; (2) the mismatch between the geographic distribution of important grazers and studies on seagrass herbivory; (3) the paucity of experimental studies from areas with little or no herbivory because few researchers would initiate a study on something not observed to be occurring; (4) the high level of seasonality in seagrass production in high latitudes, where seagrass production is very low or nonexistent in winter months; (5) the fact that temperate areas with Mediterranean climates behave very differently than temperate areas at similar latitudes with much greater seasonality, thereby making latitude a much less informative independent variable than annual range in temperature; and (6) anthropogenic disturbances, including the overharvesting to functional extinction of large seagrass herbivores in both temperate and tropical regions. Thus, while we currently cannot discount the lack of a latitudinal gradient in grazing intensity, we argue that the intensity of grazing is likely to be greater in the tropics than high-latitude regions where the carrying capacity of seagrass meadows is far less stable. Either way, there are clear gaps in our knowledge and ability to evaluate the role of grazing in seagrass ecosystems and inform future efforts to conserve and restore these extraordinarily valuable ecosystems.",We thank Adriana Verges for the early discussions and provision of a subset of the data.

Extinction of the organ-pipe Montastraea occurred after more than 500,000 years of dominance in the shallow-water reef habitat of Barbados. Extinction resulted in a morphological shift of the columnar Montastraea lineage from thick to thin columns in modern reef environments. Pleistocene colonies of the columnar morphotype sympatric with organ-pipe Montastraea showed greater column widths than those in allopatry. We subjected our data to a number of criteria for interpreting the morphological shift as character release following lifting of competitive pressure after extinction. The morphological differences do not appear to be due either to chance or to physical properties of the marine environment. Differential local extinction and recolonization of four members of the species complex did not occur on Barbados, so that the species coexisted and appear to have coevolved between more than 600,000 and 82,000 years ago. The morphological shift is related to coral growth form and growth rate, and thus reflects the acquisition of a primary resource in coralslight. Character release occurred at the same oceanic Caribbean island (Barbados) where environments have fluctuated with similar variance throughout the period of coexistence. Not only has competition among living members of the Montastraea annularis species complex been convincingly demonstrated, but trends in relative abundance among fossil members of the species complex strongly suggest that a competitive hierarchy was operating during their Pleistocene coexistence on Barbados. We also observed an ecological analogue to character release on another Caribbean island, Curaao. The distribution and abundance of living columnar M. annularis s.s. and massive M. faveolata from the leeward reef crest in Curaao is greater now than in the Pleistocene, when organ-pipe Montastraea dominated this shallow-water reef habitat. Extinction of the faster growing, shallow-water organ-pipe Montastraea resulted in higher abundance of the columnar Montastraea lineage in shallow-water habitats, where it shifted its morphology to one adapted to high light levels. The species extinction released surviving lineages from a competitive network that had resulted in lower rank abundance in the Pleistocene community and enhanced abundance of both columnar M. annularis s.s. and M. faveolata in modern communities. Full validation of our interpretation of character release must await experiments that demonstrate whether phenotypic differences between populations have a genetic basis. However, we believe the results of this study point to the important, yet heretofore neglected, role that biological interactions have played in the evolution of closely related reef coral species.

The oil was treated with 10 000 tons of toxic dispersants during cleaning operations. By itself the oil was not very toxic, although it killed some limpets and barnacles, and most of the mortalities that followed cleaning were due to the dispersants. There was a graded effect. Most animals and some algae were killed on the shores treated heavily with dispersants, while a few animals and most algae survived in places less heavily treated. However, long stretches of coast were contaminated to some extent by drifting of patches of oil and dispersants along the shore and by indiscriminate dispersant use in remote coves. The general sequence of recolonization was similar to that which has been found after small-scale experiments, where the rocks were scraped clean, or where limpets were removed, but took longer to complete. There was first a rapid ""greening"" by the alga Enteromorpha; then a heavy settlement and growth of perennial brown algae (Fucus species), leading to loss of surviving barnacles. A settlement of limpets and other grazing animals followed, with eventual removal or loss of the brown algae. The final phases were a reduction in the limpet population and a resettlement of barnacles. Lightly oiled, wave-beaten rocks that received light dispersant treatment showed the most complete return to normal, taking about 5–8 yr; heavily oiled places that received repeated application of dispersants have taken 9–10 yr and may not be completely normal yet. Most common species returned within 10 yr, but one rare hermit crab is still missing from places directly treated with dispersants. The early recolonization by algae resulted in a raising of the upper limit of Laminaria digitata and Himanthalia elongata by as much as 2 m in wave-beaten places, demonstrating that grazing pressure by limpets must be one of the factors controlling the zonation of these plants. Later, other species of plants and animals were found higher up the shore than usual, under the shade and shelter provided by the dense canopy of Fucus. Fluctuations in the populations of algae and herbivorous animals during the course of the recolonization illustrate the importance of biological interactions in controlling the structure of intertidal communities. Pollution disturbance affects the herbivores more than plants, hence the point of stability of the community is shifted towards the sheltered shore condition of low species richness and greater biomass.

The objective of this work was to determine how the physical environment and biological interactions limit these populations, that rarely, if ever, appear to be food limited. Preliminary observations suggested that the detritus-crustaceans would incur significant losses during the Winter, resulting from wave disturbance. Predation by dense schools of fishes associated with this habitat also appeared to be important. Laboratory and field experiments demonstrated that the detritus provided an effective refuge for the crustaceans. Predation rate of fishes upon detritus-associated crustaceans increased as the density of prey populations increased and/or as the thickness of the detritus mat was reduced (increasing number per m3 but not per m2). Density (m−2) of the mat crustaceans fluctuated seasonally, being greatest in the Winter and Spring following storms that eliminated large portions of the habitat. Few animals appeared to be directly eliminated by the storm disturbance. The important effect of storms was to reduce the quantity and quality of the detritus refuge by concentrating the crustaceans into smaller patches with less detrital cover. During the calm summer months the bacterium Beggiatoa sp. spread out over large portions of the detritus mat. Beneath the bacteria oxygen concentration was reduced, and infaunal density was two orders of magnitude lower than in unaffected portions of the mat. The summer increase in bacterial cover constituted a biological disturbance that functionally reduced the habitat area available to the mat fauna and left them more vulnerable to predation. Secondary production in the detrital mats is among the highest reported from natural environments. This is possible because the mat crustaceans are unable to graze down their food supply (detritus and associated microbes). The refuge provided by the detritus for large populations of invertebrates also is crucial; larger refugia translated into increased carrying capacity which allowed both greater population sizes and production, much of which became available to fishes. Most marine ecosystems are supported by allochthonous material that enters food webs via detritivores. Seafloor features that collect detritus constitute an important source of patchiness over a wide range of scales because detrital delivery is governed by physical processes. The La Jolla/Scripps Canyon system, by accumulating organic debris, provides a large food source from shallow to continental slope depths. This resource supports large numbers of fishes and presumably increases local production in higher trophic levels.","I am grateful to R.C. Brusca, P.K. Dayton, J.T. Enright, C. Harrold, R.R.

In this study, we examined plant zonation in an irregularly flooded marsh in southern Brazil. Pore water characteristics were compared in four vegetation zones across a marsh elevation gradient. Reciprocal transplants between vegetation zones and removal experiments were performed to examine species interactions in low and mid marshes. 2 There was no distinctive gradient of physical stress across the elevation of irregularly flooded low and mid marshes. Moreover, the three dominant plants, Spartina alterniflora, Spartina densiflora and Scirpus maritimus, were able to grow across the entire elevation gradient, i.e. within zones normally occupied by the other species. The only exception was Spartina alterniflora, which was strongly limited by selective herbivory by the crab Chasmagnathus granulata in the Scirpus maritimus zone. 3 Although intra‐ and interspecific competition reduced growth of all three species, no competitive hierarchy was found in any vegetation zone. 4 These results suggest that, as in tidal marshes of the north hemisphere, competition is important in structuring salt marsh plant communities. In contrast, however, plant zonation in irregularly flooded marshes cannot be explained by displacement of competitive subordinates to physically stressful habitats.

This study tested the hypothesis of diet and niche breath variation in the marbled parrotfish (Leptoscarus vaigiensis) among coral reefs of different protection levels in Kenya. Fish samples were obtained from protected (Malindi and Watamu marine parks), moderately fished (Malindi and Watamu marine reserves) and highly fished (Vipingo and Kanamai) reefs. Total lengths of fish samples were measured and their stomach contents quantified using the point method. Seasonal dietary composition, niche breaths and feeding intensities were compared between the sites using multivariate statistics. Results showed the parrotfish is a predominantly reef macroalgal grazer. Fish from protected sites fed on diverse dietary items compared to those from reserves and highly fished sites. Fish niche breadths differed between sites and seasons. Higher niche breadths occurred in protected sites during the north‐east monsoon, while higher values occurred at fished sites during the south‐east monsoon season. This study, the first of its kind in Kenya and most of the western Indian Ocean, describes feeding in the marbled parrotfish and spatial variation in niche breadth as influenced by fishing pressure, environmental variability and biological interactions. Les études sur l’écologie alimentaire des poissons sont importantes pour bien comprendre la structure et la fonction de l’écosystème. Cette étude a testé l'hypothèse d'une variation de régime alimentaire et de niche chez le poisson perroquet Leptoscarus vaigiensis dans des récifs coralliens soumis à des niveaux de protection différents au Kenya. Des échantillons de poissons furent prélevés sur des récifs protégés (Parcs Marins de Malindi et de Watamu), pêchés avec modération (Réserves Marines de Malindi et de Watamu) et intensément pêchés (Vipingo et Kanamai). La longueur totale de ces poissons a été mesurée et leur contenu stomacal a été quantifié par la Méthode de point. La composition saisonnière du régime alimentaire, l’étendue des niches et l'intensité trophique furent comparées entre les sites au moyen de statistiques multivariées. Les résultats ont montré que le poisson perroquet est principalement un brouteur de macro‐algues de récifs. Les poissons des sites protégés mangeaient des aliments plus variés que les poissons des réserves et des sites fortement pêchés. La taille des niches différait selon les sites et les saisons. Les niches étaient plus grandes dans les sites protégés pendant la mousson du nord‐est alors que des valeurs plus élevées étaient relevées dans les sites pêchés pendant la saison de la mousson du sud‐est. Cette étude, la première de ce genre au Kenya et dans la plus grande partie de l'ouest de l'océan Indien, décrit l'alimentation du Leptoscarus vaigiensis et examine la variation spatiale de la taille des niches, influencée par la pression de la pêche, la variabilité environnementale et les interactions biologiques.","We thank the Director Kenya Wildlife Service for permitting research in the marine protected areas.

The data have been subjected to variance and multiple regression analysis. Differences between densities of each species on the two shores and in the two areas of each shore are discussed with respect to the regressions on littoral height. Densities of Nerita on the sheltered shore, Austrocochlea and Bembicium on both shores, and Cellana, on the exposed shore, increased with height. The density of Cellana on the sheltered shore decreased as height increased. The density differences in the landward and seaward areas on the two shores were attributable to the effect of height for Nerita and Austrocochlea. Height was the major variable affecting the density of these two species on the sheltered shore. Bembicium and Cellana densities on both shores, and Austrocochlea density on the exposed shore, are not primarily determined by height.On the sheltered shore, Nerita and Cellana increased in density with increasing cover of water in rock pools. On the exposed shore, Bembicium and Cellana became sparser with increasing water cover. Bembicium on both shores increased in density with increasing cover of the alga Peyssonelia, as did Cellana on the exposed shore. Cellana and Austrocochlea tended to increase in density with Nerita on the sheltered shore. Cellana tended to be sparse where Bembicium was dense on the exposed shore. The biological effects of substrata and other species on the densities of each species remain unexplained.Significant time effects were found for variations in the densities of Nerita and Cellana on the sheltered shore and of Austrocochlea and Cellana on the exposed shore. The seasonal change in density of Nerita was parabolic with a minimum in summer, and is consistent with the known period of recruitment of this species. The lack of significant time effects on density of Austrocochlea on the sheltered shore is consistent with the known continuous recruitment of this species. The declining density of Austrocochlea on the moderately exposed shore was found, by size-frequency analysis, to be due to reduced recruitment compared with surrounding shores. The density of Cellana on both shores showed seasonal changes, with a maximum in summer, which is consistent with the known period of recruitment in Cellana. The lack of seasonal changes in density of Bembicium is briefly discussed.This type of multifactor analysis identifies biological interactions affecting variation in density of these species. It also corroborates the results of other ecological investigations and determines the relative importance of a variety of physical and biological factors in the distribution of density of intertidal gastropods.",,,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology,,Elsevier,"0022-0981, 1879-1697",,1975-10,1975,,1975-10,19,3,197-216,Closed,Article,"Underwood, A.J.","Underwood, A.J.

Spatial and temporal patterns of variability in rates of larval settlement may provide clues as to the processes that drive their transport and onshore delivery, as well as variation in the supply side of population dynamics. Over 3 consecutive seasons (2006–2008), the settlement of three intertidal barnacles (the chthamaloids Jehlius cirratus and Notochthamalus scabrosus, and the balanoid Notobalanus flosculus) was monitored daily at 5 to 6 sites spread over ca. 10km around the bay of Cartagena in central Chile, and over periods of 48, 71 and 53 consecutive days that encompassed the settlement season of these species. This sampling effort yielded settlement data with an unprecedented combination of temporal resolution and spatial coverage, which allowed us to assess and compare: (1) spatial patterns of settlement and their persistence over scales of days within each season, (2) inter-annual variation in pattern persistence, and (3) the relationship between such variation and inter-annual changes in spatial patterns of sea surface temperature (SST) variability over synoptic and high-frequency scales. While on average the spatial pattern of settlement in chthamaloids became less persistent from 2006 to 2008, the settlement pattern of N. flosculus across sites remained persistent regardless of inter-annual changes in mean settlement rates. Within seasons, the spatial patterns of settlement of N. flosculus were persistent over scales of at least 15days, whereas for chthamaloids a spatially ordered pattern of settlement in 2006 disappeared in subsequent years. Together, these results suggest that spatially structured processes that drive larval transport, and which can vary from year to year, may have played a greater role in shaping settlement patterns of chthamaloids versus balanoids. Synoptic-scale SST variability (i.e. days) exhibited spatial structure that was highly persistent within all three seasons. Although high-frequency SST variability (i.e. hours) has been associated to onshore larval transport within the study region, its among-site patterns were not as persistent as the daily ones. Since neither synoptic-scale nor high-frequency processes shaping patterns of physical variability are sufficient to explain inter-annual variability in patterns of larval settlement, more complex physical–biological interactions must be examined. We suggest that inter-annual changes in the pattern of wind forcing relative to local topography, and the thermal structure that results from such interaction, might be related to whether the spatial structure of barnacle settlement is persistent or fluctuating within a given season. We discuss the limitations of inferences that can be made regarding transport processes from time series of larval settlement, and the insights that can be gained by focusing on the variability of spatial patterns rather than temporal changes at individual sites.","This study was made possible by the generous support and encouragement of many people at the Estación Costera de Investigaciones Marinas, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, and by the financial support of FONDECYT-Chile through a post-doctoral grant (3070014) awarded to FT in 2007.

At One Tree Reef, in the southern Great Barrier Reef, deposit-feeding cerithiid gastropods, Rhinoclavis aspera (Linnaeus, 1758), R. fasciata (Bruguière, 1792) and R. vertagus (Linnaeus, 1758), are most abundant in an atypical environment, the coarse sandy sediments of a back-reef sandflat. Densities in the finer sediments of the lagoon are several orders of magnitude smaller than on the sandflat. In this study, these three species were enclosed at a range of naturally occurring densities in fine and coarse sediments to investigate their competitive interactions and the influence of sediment on their growth.The type of substratum in experimental enclosures influenced the growth of each species. Growth was greatest in the fine sediments from the lagoon, despite the fact that recruitment of each species had been shown to be greatest into the coarse sediments of the sandflat. Adult R. aspera significantly reduced the growth of juveniles of the three species, but adults of R. fasciata and R. vertagus had no significant effect on the growth of juveniles of R. aspera. These results are probably a function of the large disparity in the densities of the three species: R. aspera occur in densities an order of magnitude greater than the other two species and naturally occurring densities were used in the experiments.Competition for food or other expendable resources was distinguished from direct interference competition for space by including in our experiments treatments with dead shells occupying the same volume as live adults, but not utilizing expendable resources. Direct competition for space between adults and juveniles of R. aspera is unlikely to be important as a factor affecting the growth of juvenile R. aspera. Dead shells had no significant effect on the growth of juveniles in coarse or fine sediment. Direct competition for space may be more important for R. fasciata and R. vertagus because, in some cases, the presence of dead shells reduced the growth of juveniles.These experiments demonstrate how complex competitive interactions among Rhinoclavis spp. are modified by the type of sediment and vary with the particular combination of competitors. Research in rocky intertidal systems has similarly shown how the physical environment may modify the nature of biological interactions such as competition and predation. Our results are consistent with findings from temperate systems in that growth of Rhinoclavis spp. was limited by the availability of food or a related resource such as the availability of suitably sized particles of sediment for ingestion. This system differs, however, because deposit-feeding snails occur in their greatest densities in a habitat where they have the slowest rates of growth. Further work is needed to explain these patterns of distribution and abundance and why they differ from those typical of studies in temperate systems in the northern hemisphere.",,,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology,,Elsevier,"0022-0981, 1879-1697",,1993-11,1993,,1993-11,173,1,29-55,Closed,Article,"Skilleter, G.A.; Underwood, A.J.","Skilleter, G.A.

Because fragmentation can affect the intensity and quality of biological interactions (e.g., seed dispersal) we examined the abundance and species richness of seed rain produced by birds and bats in three different parts of forest islands (center, edge, and exterior) located at the Estación Biológica del Beni, Bolivia. Despite the fact that we found higher species density of seeds in the seed rain at the center of forest islands, when comparing species richness corrected for observed differences in density, species richness was higher at the edge of islands. The three parts of the islands did not differ in total number of seeds. Three genera (Byrsonima, Ficus, and Piper) contributed the most seeds to the seed rain. We found differences in the abundance of dispersed seeds probably because of the variation related with the disturbance line, where the savanna matrix interacts with the forest islands. Carollia perspicillata, Carollia brevicauda, and Sturnira lilium were the bats that contributed most to seed dispersal within forest islands, and Schistochlamys melanopis and Tyranneutes stolzmanni were the most important birds. The movement of seeds produced by bats and birds within forest islands of the savanna is crucial to assure the continuity of ecological process and dynamics of these forest islands. El alto grado de aislamiento de las “islas de bosque” en relación a áreas “continentales” boscosas crea un paisaje naturalmente fragmentado en el ecosistema de sabana. Debido a que la fragmentación puede afectar la intensidad y calidad de interacciones biológicas (e.g., dispersión de semillas) estudiamos la abundancia y riqueza de la lluvia de semillas producida por aves y murciélagos en tres partes distintas de las “islas de bosque” (centro, borde y exterior) localizadas en la Estación Biológica del Beni, Bolivia. A pesar de que encontramos la mayor densidad de especies de semillas en el centro de las “islas de bosque”, al comparar la riqueza de especies corregida por las diferencias en densidad observadas, determinamos que la riqueza es mayor en el borde de las “islas de bosque”. En relación con la abundancia, no encontramos diferencias entre las tres partes de las “islas de bosque” al considerar el número total de semillas. Tres géneros (Byrsonima, Ficus, y Piper) contribuyeron la mayor cantidad de semillas a la lluvia de semillas. Econtramos que existen diferencias en la abundancia de semillas dispersadas probablemente debido a la distancia a la línea de disturbio, donde la “isla de bosque” interactúa con la matriz de sabana. Tres especies de murciélagos (Carollia brevicauda, Carollia perspicillata, y Sturnira lilium) y dos especies de aves (Schistochlamys melanopis y Tyranneutes stolzmanni) fueron los mayores contribuidores a la dispersión de las semillas en las “islas de bosque”. El movimiento de las semillas producida por murciélagos y aves en “islas de bosque” será fundamental para asegurar la continuidad de los procesos ecológicos y la dinámica de estas “islas de bosque.”","We thank the Institute of Ecology of the Universidad Mayor de San Andrés and the Foundation Liz Claiborne and Art Ortenberg for the economic support to the present investigation.
