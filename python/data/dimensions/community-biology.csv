Multiple types of co-limitation have been described, enabling distinctions based on the hypothesized mechanisms of co-limitation at a biochemical level. These definitions usually pertain to individuals and do not explicitly, or even implicitly, consider complex ecological dynamics found within a microbial community. However, limiting and co-limiting nutrients can be produced in situ by a subset of microbial community members, suggesting that interactions within communities can underpin co-limitation. To address this, we propose a new category of nutrient co-limitation, community interaction co-limitation (CIC). During CIC, one part of the community is limited by one nutrient, which results in the insufficient production or transformation of a biologically produced nutrient that is required by another part of the community, often primary producers. Using cobalamin (vitamin B12) and nitrogen fixation as our models, we outline three different ways CIC can arise based on current literature and discuss CIC's role in biogeochemical cycles. Accounting for the inherent and complex roles microbial community interactions play in generating this type of co-limitation requires an expanded toolset - beyond the traditional approaches used to identify and study other types of co-limitation. We propose incorporating processes and theories well-known in microbial ecology and evolution to provide meaningful insight into the controls of community-based feedback loops and mechanisms that give rise to CIC in the environment. Finally, we highlight the data gaps that limit our understanding of CIC mechanisms and suggest methods to overcome these and further identify causes and consequences of CIC. By providing this framework for understanding and identifying CIC, we enable systematic examination of the impacts this co-limitation can have on current and future marine biogeochemical processes.","We thank Maria Soto for preliminary work on the literature review, and Catalina Albury and Scott McCain for helpful feedback on the manuscript.

Disturbances of these communities can lead to loss of interactions and thereby important ecosystem functionality. The research on what drives interactions in microbial communities is still in its infancy, and much information has been gained from the study of model communities. One purpose of using these model microbial communities is that they can be cultured under controlled conditions. Yet, it is not well known how fluctuations of abiotic factors such as temperature affect their interaction networks. In this work, we have studied the effect of temperature on interactions between the members of the model community THOR, which consists of three bacterial species: Pseudomonas koreensis, Flavobacterium johnsoniae, and Bacillus cereus. Our results show that the community-intrinsic properties resulting from their interspecies interactions are highly dependent on incubation temperature. We also found that THOR biofilms had remarkably different abundances of their members when grown at 11, 18, and 25°C. The results suggest that the sensitivity of community interactions to changes in temperature is influenced, but not completely dictated, by different growth rates of the individual members at different temperatures. Our findings likely extend to other microbial communities and environmental parameters. Thus, temperature could affect community stability and may influence diverse processes including soil productivity, bioprocessing, and disease suppression. Moreover, to establish reproducibility between laboratories working with microbial model communities, it is crucial to ensure experimental stability, including carefully managed temperature conditions.","We would like to thank the lab of Jo Handelsman for assistance with the THOR strains, particularly Jennifer Heinritz, Martel den Hartog, Amanda Hurley, and Jo Handelsman.

However, few studies have considered the role of multiple biotic and abiotic factors in shaping trait variation and spectra. In this study, we determined seven leaf traits of 66 Solidago canadensis populations, and quantified the relative contributions of climate, soil properties, native plant diversity, and S. canadensis–community interactions (in total 16 factors) to leaf trait variation and spectrum with multimodel inference.ResultsOverall, the seven leaf traits had high phenotypic variation, and this variation was highest for leaf dry matter content and lowest for leaf carbon concentration. The per capita contribution of climate to the mean leaf trait variation was highest (7.5%), followed by soil properties (6.2%), S. canadensis–community interactions (6.1%), and native plant diversity (5.4%); the dominant factors underlying trait variation varied with leaf traits. Leaf production potential was negatively associated with leaf stress-tolerance potential, and the relative contributions to this trade-off followed in order: native plant diversity (7.7%), climate (6.9%), S. canadensis–community interactions (6.2%), and soil properties (5.6%). Climate, diversity, soil, and interactions had positive, neutral or negative effects.ConclusionsClimate, soil, diversity, and interactions contribute differentially to the leaf trait variation and economics spectrum of S. canadensis, and their relative importance and directions depend on plant functional traits.",We are very grateful to Dr. Hong-Wei Yu for his field help and Dr. Jian-Xia Yang for her laboratory help.,,BMC Ecology and Evolution,,Springer Nature,"2730-7182, 1472-6785",Climate; Ecosystem; Plant Leaves; Soil; Solidago,2019-06-15,2019,2019-06-15,2019-12,19,1,24,All OA; Gold,Article,"Dong, Li-Jia; He, Wei-Ming","Dong, Li-Jia (State Key Laboratory of Vegetation and Environmental Change, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100093, Beijing, China; College of Life Science, Shaoxing University, 312000, Zhejiang, China); He, Wei-Ming (State Key Laboratory of Vegetation and Environmental Change, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100093, Beijing, China; College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100049, Beijing, China)","Dong, Li-Jia (Institute of Botany; Shaoxing University); He, Wei-Ming (Institute of Botany; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences)","Dong, Li-Jia (Institute of Botany; Shaoxing University); He, Wei-Ming (Institute of Botany; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences)",University of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shaoxing University; Institute of Botany,grid.410726.6; grid.412551.6; grid.435133.3,Beijing; Shaoxing; Beijing,; ; ,China; China; China,National Natural Science Foundation of China; Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China,,China; China,grant.8189993; grant.8198745,31570538; 31700476,12,9,0.55,2.89,,https://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12898-019-0240-1,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1117187428,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,A05 Biological Sciences,13 Climate Action
2410,pub.1075071407,,12068948,,,A dynamic requirement for community interactions during Xenopus myogenesis.,"The community effect is an interaction among a group of many nearby cells that is necessary for them to maintain tissue-specific gene expression and differentiate co-ordinately. A community interaction is required for the muscle precursor cells of the Xenopus embryo to develop into terminally differentiated muscle, but exactly when and where the community effect acts during myogenesis has not been determined. Here, we ask whether dependence on the community effect varies with the developmental age of the muscle precursor cells. We find that dependence on the community signal changes with time through the muscle precursor cell population. During neurulation muscle precursor cells that are still in the vicinity of the blastopore and that are fated to form posterior muscle continue to require interactions with their neighbours, while differentiation of the anterior paraxial mesoderm,which gastrulated earlier, is independent of cell contact at this time. Thus the time during which a particular sub-population of muscle precursor cells requires a community interaction is related to their final destination along the anterior-posterior axis. In addition we show that this later acting community interaction around the blastopore involves FGF signalling.",,,The International Journal of Developmental Biology,,,"0214-6282, 1696-3547","Animals; Body Patterning; Cell Communication; Cell Differentiation; Communication; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Mesoderm; Morphogenesis; Muscle Development; Muscle, Skeletal; Xenopus",2002-05,2002,,2002-05,46,3,279-83,Closed,Article,"Standley, Henrietta J; Zorn, Aaron M; Gurdon, John B","Standley, Henrietta J (Wellcome CR UK Institute, Cambridge, UK. starn5@chmcc.org); Zorn, Aaron M (); Gurdon, John B ()",,"Standley, Henrietta J (); Zorn, Aaron M (); Gurdon, John B ()",,,,,,,,,,,12,0,0.16,0.96,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1075071407,31 Biological Sciences; 3105 Genetics; 3108 Plant Biology; 3109 Zoology,,,2.1 Biological and endogenous factors,Not Site-Specific Cancer,1.1 Normal Functioning,A05 Biological Sciences,

However, the changes that occur in human gut microbial communities after appendectomy have never been analyzed. We assessed the alterations in gut bacterial and fungal populations associated with a history of appendectomy. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the association between appendectomy and the gut microbiome using 16S and ITS2 sequencing on fecal samples from 30 healthy individuals with prior appendectomy (HwA) and 30 healthy individuals without appendectomy (HwoA). Analysis showed that the gut bacterial composition of samples from HwA was less diverse than that of samples from HwoA and had a lower abundance of Roseburia, Barnesiella, Butyricicoccus, Odoribacter, and Butyricimonas species, most of which were short-chain fatty acids-producing microbes. The HwA subgroup analysis indicated a trend toward restoration of the HwoA bacterial microbiome over time after appendectomy. HwA had higher gut fungi composition and diversity than HwoA, even 5 years after appendectomy. Compared with those in samples from HwoA, the abundance correlation networks in samples from HwA displayed more complex fungal-fungal and fungal-bacterial community interactions.

Periphyton biofilms may harbor significant amounts of MMHg but little is known about the Hg-methylating potential of the periphyton microbiome. Therefore, we used high-throughput amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, ITS2 region, and Hg methylation gene pair (hgcAB) to characterize the archaea/bacteria, fungi, and Hg-methylating microorganisms in periphyton communities grown in a contaminated watershed in East Tennessee (United States). Furthermore, we examined how nutrient amendments (nitrate and/or phosphate) altered periphyton community structure and function. We found that bacterial/archaeal richness in experimental conditions decreased in summer and increased in autumn relative to control treatments, while fungal diversity generally increased in summer and decreased in autumn relative to control treatments. Interestingly, the Hg-methylating communities were dominated by Proteobacteria followed by Candidatus Atribacteria across both seasons. Surprisingly, Hg methylation potential correlated with numerous bacterial families that do not contain hgcAB, suggesting that the overall microbiome structure of periphyton communities influences rates of Hg transformation within these microbial mats. To further explore these complex community interactions, we performed a microbial network analysis and found that the nitrate-amended treatment resulted in the highest number of hub taxa that also corresponded with enhanced Hg methylation potential. This work provides insight into community interactions within the periphyton microbiome that may contribute to Hg cycling and will inform future research that will focus on establishing mixed microbial consortia to uncover mechanisms driving shifts in Hg cycling within periphyton habitats.","We thank Connie Lim for her assistance in the laboratory and field.

However, it remains unclear how microbial community diversity and their eco-functions are affected by anthropogenic disturbances rather than natural environmental changes. Here, we explored sediment microbial functional genes dynamics and community interaction networks in Hangzhou Bay (HZB), one of the most severely polluted bays on China's eastern coast. The results indicated key microbial functional gene categories, including N, P, S, and aromatic compound metabolism, and stress response, displayed significant spatial dynamics along environmental gradients. Sensitive feedbacks of key functional gene categories to N and P pollutants demonstrated potential impacts of human-induced seawater pollutants to microbial functional capacity. Seawater ammonia and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) was identified as primary drivers in selecting adaptive populations and varying community composition. Network analysis revealed distinct modules that were stimulated in inner or outer bay. Importantly, the network keystone species, which played a fundamental role in community interactions, were strongly affected by N-pollutants. Our results provide a systematic understanding of the microbial compositional and functional dynamics in an urbanized coastal estuary, and highlighted the impact of human activities on these communities.","We appreciate the great help in sample collection by Zhejiang Provincial Zhoushan Marine Ecological Environmental Monitoring Station and Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Water Science and Technology, Department of Environmental Technology and Ecology, Yangtze Delta Region Institute of Tsinghua University.

During 7 years of hospital Legionella surveillance, in 191 hot water positive samples, the interactions among the Legionella species, temperature, and disinfection treatment were evaluated. Legionella was isolated following ISO 11731:2017, and identification was performed by mip gene sequencing and sequence-based typing (SBT) for L. anisa or L. rubrilucens and L. pneumophila, respectively. The species with the higher frequency of isolation was L. pneumophila serogroup 1 (78.53%; 4865.36 ± 25,479.11 cfu/L), followed by L. anisa (54.45%; 558.79 ± 2637.41 cfu/L) and L. rubrilucens (21.99%; 307.73 ± 1574.95 cfu/L), which were sometimes present together. Spearman’s rho correlation test was conducted among the species with respect to temperature and disinfectant (H2O2/Ag+). The results showed a generally positive interaction among these species sharing the same environment, except for competition between L. anisa and L. rubrilucens. High temperature (48.83 ± 2.59 °C) and disinfection treatment (11.58 ± 4.99 mg/L) affected the presence of these species. An exception was observed with L. anisa, which showed disinfection treatment resistance. For the purposes of environmental surveillance, it is fundamental to better understand the interactions and dynamic of the Legionella community in man-made water systems in order to choose the proper physical or chemical treatments. The simultaneous presence of different Legionella species could result in an increased resistance to high temperature and disinfectant treatment, leading to changes in contamination level and species diversity.",The authors would like to thank Graziella Ciani for the microbiological analysis.,Open access funding provided by Alma Mater Studiorum - Università di Bologna within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.,Microbial Ecology,,Springer Nature,"0095-3628, 1432-184X",Disinfection; Humans; Hydrogen Peroxide; Legionella; Legionella pneumophila; Temperature; Water Microbiology,2021-06-05,2021,2021-06-05,2022-02,83,2,353-362,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Girolamini, Luna; Salaris, Silvano; Pascale, Maria Rosaria; Mazzotta, Marta; Cristino, Sandra","Girolamini, Luna (Department of Biological, Geological, and Environmental Sciences, University of Bologna, via San Giacomo 12, 40126, Bologna, BO, Italy); Salaris, Silvano (Department of Biological, Geological, and Environmental Sciences, University of Bologna, via San Giacomo 12, 40126, Bologna, BO, Italy); Pascale, Maria Rosaria (Department of Biological, Geological, and Environmental Sciences, University of Bologna, via San Giacomo 12, 40126, Bologna, BO, Italy); Mazzotta, Marta (Department of Biological, Geological, and Environmental Sciences, University of Bologna, via San Giacomo 12, 40126, Bologna, BO, Italy); Cristino, Sandra (Department of Biological, Geological, and Environmental Sciences, University of Bologna, via San Giacomo 12, 40126, Bologna, BO, Italy)","Cristino, Sandra (University of Bologna)","Girolamini, Luna (University of Bologna); Salaris, Silvano (University of Bologna); Pascale, Maria Rosaria (University of Bologna); Mazzotta, Marta (University of Bologna); Cristino, Sandra (University of Bologna)",University of Bologna,grid.6292.f,Bologna,Emilia-Romagna,Italy,,,,,,5,5,2.15,2.1,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00248-021-01778-9.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138636412,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3107 Microbiology,,,,,,B12 Engineering,

As they originate from the outer surface of the bacteria, their composition and content is generally similar to the parent bacterium's membrane and cytoplasm. However, there is ample evidence that preferential packaging of proteins, metabolites, and toxins into vesicles does occur. Incorporation into vesicles imparts a number of benefits to the cargo, including protection from degradation by other bacteria, the host organism, or environmental factors, maintenance of a favorable microenvironment for enzymatic activity, and increased potential for long-distance movement. This enables vesicles to serve specialized functions tailored to changing or challenging environments, particularly in regard to microbial community interactions including quorum sensing, biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance, antimicrobial peptide expression and deployment, and nutrient acquisition. Additionally, based on their contents, vesicles play crucial roles in host-microbe interactions as carriers of virulence factors and other modulators of host cell function. Here, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of how vesicles function as signals both within microbial communities and between pathogenic or commensal microbes and their mammalian hosts. We also highlight a few areas that are currently ripe for additional research, including the mechanisms of selective cargo packaging into membrane vesicles and of cargo processing once it enters mammalian host cells, the function of vesicles in transfer of nucleic acids among bacteria, and the possibility of engineering commensal bacteria to deliver cargo of interest to mammalian hosts in a controlled manner.",,Funding.

Rising temperatures will impact insect physiology and associated fitness and will shift populations in space and time, thereby altering community interactions and composition. Shifts in space are expected as insects move upslope to escape warming temperatures and shifts in time will occur with changes in phenology of resident high-elevation insects. Clearly, spatiotemporal shifts will not affect all species equally. Terrestrial insects may have more opportunities than aquatic insects to exploit microhabitats, potentially buffering them from warming. Such responses of insects to warming may also fuel evolutionary change, including hitchhiking of maladaptive alleles and genetic rescue. Together, these considerations suggest a striking restructuring of high-elevation insect communities that remains largely unstudied.","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grant nos.

On rare occasions, the adaptation of a species can lead to the extinction of others, and even its own. 'Adaptive dynamics' is the standard mathematical framework to describe evolutionary changes in community interactions, and in particular, predict adaptation driven extinction. Unfortunately, most authors implement the equations of adaptive dynamics through computer simulations that require assuming a large number of questionable parameters and fitness functions. In this study, we present analytical solutions to adaptive dynamics equations, thereby clarifying how outcomes depend on any computational input. We develop general formulas that predict equilibrium abundances over evolutionary time scales.

Hydra is one of the evolutionary oldest animals with naturally occurring tumors. Here, we found a causal relationship between an environmental spirochete (Turneriella spec.) and tumorigenesis in Hydra. Unexpectedly, virulence of this pathogen requires the presence of Pseudomonas spec., a member of Hydra´s beneficial microbiome indicating that dynamic interactions between a resident bacterium and a pathogen cause tumor formation. The observation points to the crucial role of commensal bacteria in maintaining tissue homeostasis and adds support to the view that microbial community interactions are essential for disease.

Experimental mesocosms were planted with live aquatic macrophytes and allowed to be naturally colonized by local invertebrates. Results indicated a positive effect of macrophyte diversity on competitor diversity and a negative effect on predator diversity. In turn, predator diversity negatively impacted mosquito abundance through a direct effect, while competitor diversity showed an indirect negative effect on mosquito larval abundance through its positive effect on predator diversity.

Resistant pathogens must therefore overcome such fitness decreases to persist within their hosts. Here we demonstrate that the reduced fitness associated with one resistance-conferring mutation can be offset by community interactions with microorganisms harboring alternative mutations or via interactions with the human microbiota. Mutations that confer antibiotic resistance in the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus led to decreased fitness, whereas coculture or coinfection of two distinct mutants resulted in collective recovery of fitness comparable to that of wild-type. Such fitness enhancements result from the exchange of metabolites between distinct mutants, leading to enhanced growth, virulence factor production, and pathogenicity. Interspecies fitness enhancements were also identified, as members of the human microbiota can promote growth of antibiotic-resistant S. aureus. Thus, inter- and intraspecies community interactions offset fitness costs and enable S. aureus to develop antibiotic resistance without loss of virulence.","We thank Drs.

Researchers have attempted to understand some aspects of these interactions by examining patterns in animal body mass distributions. Energetic, phylogenetic, biogeographical, textural discontinuity and community interaction hypotheses have been advanced to explain observed patterns. Energetic and textural discontinuity hypotheses focus upon the allometry of resource use. The community interaction hypothesis contends that biotic interactions within assemblages of species are of primary importance. Biogeographical and phylogenetic hypotheses focus on the role of constraints on the organization of communities. This paper examines and organizes these various propositions about species body mass distributions and discusses the multiple competing hypotheses, how their predictions vary, and possible methods by which the hypotheses can be distinguished and tested. Each of the hypotheses is partial, and explains some elements of pattern in body mass distributions. The scale of appropriate application, relevance and interpretation varies among the hypotheses, and the mechanisms underlying observed patterns are likely to be multicausal and vary with scale.","Support was provided by the James S.

Using a host-parasite system involving freshwater snails, amphibians and trematode parasites, we conducted a year-long, outdoor experiment to evaluate how warming affected net parasite production, the timing of infection and the resultant pathology. Warming of 3 °C caused snail intermediate hosts to release parasites 9 months earlier and increased infected snail mortality by fourfold, leading to decreased overlap between amphibians and parasites. As a result, warming halved amphibian infection loads and reduced pathology by 67%, despite comparable total parasite production across temperature treatments. These results demonstrate that climate-disease theory should be expanded to account for predicted changes in host and parasite phenology, which may often be more important than changes in total parasite output for predicting climate-driven changes in disease risk.","We would like to thank K.

Metagenomics is a useful tool in the discovery of previously unknown taxa, but its use to understand the functional and ecological capacities of the microbiome is limited until taxonomy and function are understood in the context of the community. We suggest that this can be achieved using a combined functional phylogenomics and co-culture-based experimental strategy that can increase our capacity to measure sub-community interactions. Functional phylogenomics can identify and partition the genome such that hidden gene functions and gene clusters with unique evolutionary signals are revealed. We can test these phylogenomic predictions using an experimental model based on sub-community populations that represent a subset of the diversity directly obtained from environmental samples. These populations increase the detection of mechanisms that drive functional forces in the assembly of the microbiome, in particular the role of metabolites from key taxa in community interactions. Our combined approach leverages the potential of metagenomics to address biological questions from ecological systems.","We especially thank Pablo Cruz-Morales for providing unpublished data, help on editing figures, and being a sustained source of thought-provoking discussions.

Although microbial microcosms offer powerful systems to investigate it, interrogating the environment is much more arduous. Here, we show in a 1-year survey that the obligate predators Bdellovibrio and like organisms (BALOs) can regulate prey populations, possibly in a density-dependent manner, in the naturally complex, species-rich environments of wastewater treatment plants. Abundant as well as rarer prey populations are affected, leading to an oscillating predatory landscape shifting at various temporal scales in which the total population remains stable. Shifts, along with differential prey range, explain co-existence of the numerous predators through niche partitioning. We validate these sequence-based findings using single-cell sorting combined with fluorescent hybridization and community sequencing. Our approach should be applicable for deciphering community interactions in other systems.","We would like to thank Ashraf Al Ashhab and Amatzia Wilk for their help with sample logistics at the Al-Bireh and Shafdan plants, respectively, and Julia Johnke for technical assistance.

Alternative vanadium and iron-only nitrogenases that are homologous to molybdenum nitrogenases are also found in archaea and bacteria, but they have a different transition metal, either vanadium or iron, at their active sites. So far alternative nitrogenases have only been found in microbes that also have molybdenum nitrogenase. They are less widespread than molybdenum nitrogenase in bacteria and archaea, and they are less efficient.

To deal with this complexity, we can apply lessons learned from the study of model organisms and try to find simpler systems that can shed light on the same questions. Here, microbial model communities are essential, as they can allow us to learn about the metabolic interactions, genetic mechanisms and ecological principles governing and structuring communities. A variety of microbial model communities of varying complexity have already been developed, representing different purposes, environments and phenomena. However, choosing a suitable model community for one's research question is no easy task. This review aims to be a guide in the selection process, which can help the researcher to select a sufficiently well-studied model community that also fulfills other relevant criteria. For example, a good model community should consist of species that are easy to grow, have been evaluated for community behaviors, provide simple readouts and - in some cases - be of relevance for natural ecosystems. Finally, there is a need to standardize growth conditions for microbial model communities and agree on definitions of community-specific phenomena and frameworks for community interactions. Such developments would be the key to harnessing the power of simplicity to start disentangling complex community interactions.","I would like to thank my research group, particularly Emil Burman, as well as Paige Hansen at University of Kansas, for valuable discussions on the topic of interactions in model communities and providing inspiration for parts of this work.

We present a four-species model of a pollination mutualism embedded in other types of community interactions. Conclusions derived from two-species models about the destabilizing effect of mutualisms are misleading when applied to the present scenario; although the mutualisms are locally destabilizing, the effect is more than canceled by an increased chance of feasibility. The crucial difference is the interaction of the mutualists with other species in a larger web. Furthermore, community persistence (without unrealistic population explosion), arguably a superior ecological criterion, is greatly enhanced by the presence of mutualisms. Therefore, we predict that mutualisms should be common in the real world, a prediction matching empirial findings and in contrast to the predictions from local stability analysis of basic two-species models. This method of stabilizing a mutualism appears superior in some ways to the often-used method of introducing density dependence in the strength of the mutualism, because it permits obligate mutualisms to exist even at low densities, again matching empirical findings. Lastly, this study is an example of how complex model assemblages can behave qualitatively differently from analogous simpler ones.",,,Theoretical Population Biology,,Elsevier,"0040-5809, 1096-0325","Animals; Bees; Birds; Competitive Behavior; Ecosystem; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Feeding Behavior; Models, Theoretical; Plant Physiological Phenomena; Pollen; Predatory Behavior",1996-12,1996,,1996-12,50,3,281-297,Closed,Article,"Ringel, Michael S.; Hu, Helen H.; Anderson, Garrett; Ringel, Michael S.","Ringel, Michael S.

The advent of high-throughput sequencing methods has led to novel insights in changing patterns of community composition and structure. However, deciphering the different types of interactions among community members, with their hosts and their interplay with their environment is still a challenge of major proportion. The emerging fields of synthetic microbial ecology and community systems biology have the potential to decrypt these complex relationships. Studying host-associated microbiota across multiple spatial and temporal scales will bridge the gap between individual microorganism studies and large-scale whole community surveys. Here, we discuss the unique potential of Hydra as an emerging experimental model in microbiome research. Through in vivo, in vitro, and in silico approaches the interaction structure of host-associated microbial communities and the effects of the host on the microbiota and its interactions can be disentangled. Research in the model system Hydra can unify disciplines from molecular genetics to ecology, opening up the opportunity to discover fundamental rules that govern microbiome community stability.",The authors would like to thank Katrin Hammerschmidt and the three referees for helpful comments on an earlier version of the manuscript and Katja Schröder for the graphical design of the Hydra polyp.

While historically light pollution has not received attention comparable to climate change or chemical pollution, research over the past several decades has revealed the plethora of negative effects on humans, animals, and supporting ecosystems. As light pollution continues to grow in spatial, spectral, and temporal extent, we recognize the urgent need to understand how this affects circadian physiology, organismal fitness, life history traits and tradeoffs, population trends, and community interactions. Here, we aim to highlight background and foundational evidence of the effects of light pollution to present context and the basis for early light pollution studies. Next, we touch on several understudied topics where research is underway to fill gaps in our knowledge and provide the basis for future research.

These systems integrate the various organs of the whole plant, perform material exchange between different plant tissues and mediate the transmission of signals between cells or over long distances. Grafting and parasitism can reshape the vascular tissues of different ecotypes or species and represent two important systems for studying plant systemic signaling. In recent years, with the advancement of genomics and sequencing technology, the transportation, identification, and function of systemic plant macromolecules have been extensively studied. Here, we review the current body of knowledge of the transport pathways and regulatory mechanisms of macromolecules in plants and assess systemic, long-distance signal trafficking that mediates stress responses, and plant-environment or plant-insect community interactions. Additionally, we propose several methods for identifying mobile mRNAs and proteins.

However, little is known about the relative strengths and interactions of the various belowground legacies on aboveground plant-insect interactions. We used an outdoor mesocosm experiment to investigate the belowground legacy effects of range-expanding versus native plants, extreme drought and their interactions on plants, aphids and pollinators. We show that plant biomass was influenced more strongly by the previous plant community than by the previous summer drought. Plant communities consisted of four congeneric pairs of natives and range expanders, and their responses were not unanimous. Legacy effects affected the abundance of aphids more strongly than pollinators. We conclude that legacies can be contained as soil 'memories' that influence aboveground plant community interactions in the next growing season. These soil-borne 'memories' can be altered by climate warming-induced plant range shifts and extreme drought.","We thank Marta Manrubia and Qiang Yang for setting up the plant and drought legacy treatments in 2017 and 2018, Tjomme van Mastrigt for helping with data collection and Olga Kostenko, Raúl Ochoa‐Hueso, Gerrit Gort and Lauren McIntyre for advice on data analysis.

Biological variation among taxa within the genus is apparent through genetic and phenotypic differences between strains and via the spatial and temporal distribution of strains in the environment, and this fine-scale diversity exerts strong influence over bloom toxicity. Yet we do not know how varying traits of Microcystis strains govern their environmental distribution, the tradeoffs and links between these traits, or how they are encoded at the genomic level. Here we synthesize current knowledge on the importance of diversity within Microcystis and on the genes and traits that likely underpin ecological differentiation of taxa. We briefly review spatial and environmental patterns of Microcystis diversity in the field and genetic evidence for cohesive groups within Microcystis. We then compile data on strain-level diversity regarding growth responses to environmental conditions and explore evidence for variation of community interactions across Microcystis strains. Potential links and tradeoffs between traits are identified and discussed. The resulting picture, while incomplete, highlights key knowledge gaps that need to be filled to enable new models for predicting strain-level dynamics, which influence the development, toxicity and cosmopolitan nature of Microcystis blooms.","This work was supported by funding from NSF (OCE‐1736629 to G.J.D.) and from the NOAA Great Lakes Omics program distributed through the UM Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (NA17OAR4320152 to V.J.D., M.B.D. and G.J.D.) and through the NOAA Cooperative Agreement with the Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR) at the University of Michigan (NA17OAR4320152).

To this end, we examined the temporal effects of dam removal on fish community interactions using multivariate autoregressive models to understand changes in fish community structure in the Eightmile River System, Connecticut, USA. We sampled fish for 6 years during the growing season; 1 year prior to, 2 years during, and for 3 years after a small dam removal event. The multivariate autoregressive analysis revealed that the site above the dam was the most reactive and least resilient sample site, followed in order by the below-dam and nearby reference site. Even 3 years after the dam removal event, the stream was still in a recovery stage that had failed to approximate the community structure of the reference site. This suggests that the reorganization of fish communities following dam removals, with the goal of ecological restoration, may take decades to centuries for the restored sites to approximate the community structure of nearby undisturbed sites. Results from this study also highlight the utility of multivariate autoregressive modeling for examining temporal interactions among species in response to adaptive management activities both in aquatic systems and elsewhere.","We would like to thank A.

Patients suffering from chronic respiratory disease are prone to persistent, debilitating respiratory infections due to the decreased ability to clear pathogens from the respiratory tract. Such infections often develop into chronic, life-long complications that are difficult to treat with antibiotics due to the formation of recalcitrant biofilms. The microbial communities present in the upper and lower respiratory tracts change as these respiratory diseases progress, often becoming less diverse and dysbiotic, correlating with worsening patient morbidity. Those with chronic respiratory disease are commonly infected with a shared group of respiratory pathogens including Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Moraxella catarrhalis, among others. In order to understand the microbial landscape of the respiratory tract during chronic disease, we review the known inter-species interactions among these organisms and other common respiratory flora. We consider both the balance between cooperative and competitive interactions in relation to microbial community structure. By reviewing the major causes of chronic respiratory disease, we identify common features across disease states and signals that might contribute to community shifts. As microbiome shifts have been associated with respiratory disease progression, worsening morbidity, and increased mortality, these underlying community interactions likely have an impact on respiratory disease state.",,"Funding.

During Xenopus myogenesis, the muscle precursor cells must be in group contact throughout gastrulation in order to develop into terminally differentiated muscle. The molecular basis of this community interaction has not to date been elucidated. We have developed an assay for testing potential community factors, in which isolated muscle precursor cells are treated with a candidate protein and cultured in dispersion. We have tested a number of candidate factors and we find that only eFGF protein is able to mediate a community effect, stimulating stable muscle-specific gene expression in demonstrably single muscle precursor cells. In contrast, Xwnt8, bFGF, BMP4 and TGF(&bgr;)2 do not show this capacity. We show that eFGF is expressed in the muscle precursor cells at the right time to mediate the community effect. Moreover, the time when the muscle precursor cells are sensitive to eFGF corresponds to the period of the endogenous community effect. Finally, we demonstrate that FGF signalling is essential for endogenous community interactions. We conclude that eFGF is likely to mediate the community effect in Xenopus myogenesis.","REFERENCES We are very grateful to H. Isaacs and M. E.

A novel synthetic micro-ecosystem (SM) with functional materials as the core structure was prepared to enhance nitrate removal during wastewater treatment. Nitrate removal in the reactors with SM increased by more than 40 % and reached 97.43 % under aerobic conditions. The abundance of denitrification functional genes in activated sludge increased by 2.7 folds after adding SM. Network analysis showed that the denitrifying bacterial community in the reactors with SM displayed a more abundant symbiotic structure. In the reactors with SM, bacteria with both denitrification and inorganic electron transfer capabilities (such as Paracoccus sp., Thaurea sp., and Achromobacter sp.) occupied dominant niche. A species abundance distribution model indicated more intense competition for the dominant niche for the denitrification community in the reactor with SM. Thus, SM promotes denitrification in polluted water bodies under aerobic conditions.","This study was funded by the National Natural Science of China (Nos. 51978561, 51979217, 52170012), and the Grant from Youth Innovation Team of Shaanxi Universities in 2020 (No. 21JP061, PI: Dr. Haihan Zhang), and the Key project of Shaanxi Natural Science Basic Research Program (No. 2021JZ-50).",,Bioresource Technology,,Elsevier,"0960-8524, 1873-2976",Bacteria; Bioreactors; Carbon; Denitrification; Ecosystem; Nitrates; Nitrogen; Wastewater; Water,2022-03-16,2022,2022-03-16,2022-05,351,,127013,Closed,Article,"Zhang, Haihan; Ma, Ben; Huang, Tinglin; Yang, Wanqiu; Liu, Xiang; Niu, Limin","Zhang, Haihan (Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Environmental Engineering, Key Laboratory of Northwest Water Resource, Environment and Ecology, MOE, Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi'an 710055, China; School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi'an 710055, China.

Most studies to date have approached biofuel optimization through synthetic biology and process engineering with few industrial scale projects considering algal community interactions. Such interactions can potentially lead to increased productivity and reduced community invasability, both important characteristics for scalable algal biofuel production. It is estimated that over a million species of algae exist such that elucidating the interactions that might be beneficial for biofuel production remains extremely resource and time intensive. Here we describe a strategy for rapid, high-throughput screening of algal community combinations using a microfluidic platform to generate millions of parallel, nanoliter-scale algal mixed cultures for estimation of biomass accumulation. Model communities were first studied in a bench scale flask experiment and then examined using microfluidic droplets. These experiments showed consistent results for both positively interacting algal bicultures that increase biomass when together, and negatively interacting bicultures that decrease biomass. Specifically, these included enhanced performance of two bicultures, Ankistrodesmus falcatus and Chlorella sorokiniana, Chlorella sorokiniana and Selenastrum minutum, and reduced performance of a biculture consisting of Selenastrum capricornutum and Scenedesmus ecornis. While the ultimate techno-economic feasibility of algal bioproducts hinges on an amalgamation of scientific fields, rapid screening of algal communities will prove imperative for efficiently discovering community interactions.",This work was conducted with funding from the University of Michigan MCubed program and the National Science Foundation (EFRI 1332342).

When sulfate is present, sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are stimulated, competing with methanogens for common substrates, which decreases CH4 production and results in the formation of corrosive, odorous hydrogen sulfide gas (H2S). Here, we show that a population of SRB within a methanogenic bioreactor fed only butyrate for years immediately (within hours) responded to sulfate availability and shifted the microbial community dynamics within the bioreactor. By mapping shotgun metatranscriptomes to metagenome-assembled genomes, we shed light on the transcriptomic responses of key community members in response to increased sulfate provision. We link these short-term transcriptional responses to long-term niche partitioning using comparative metagenomic analyses. Our results suggest that sulfate provision supports a syntrophic butyrate oxidation community that disfavors poly-β-hydroxyalkanoate storage and that hydrogenotrophic SRB populations effectively exclude obligately hydrogenotrophic, but not aceticlastic, methanogens when sulfate is readily available. These findings elucidate key ecological dynamics between SRB, methanogens and syntrophic butyrate-oxidizing bacteria, which can be applied to a variety of engineered and natural systems.",,,FEMS Microbiology Ecology,,Oxford University Press (OUP),"0168-6496, 1574-6941",Bioreactors; Butyrates; Euryarchaeota; Methane; Sulfates,2020-03-19,2020,2020-03-19,2020-05-01,96,5,fiaa050,Closed,Article,"St. James, Andrew R; Richardson, Ruth E","St. James, Andrew R (School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Cornell University, 527 College Ave, Hollister Hall, Ithaca, NY, USA 14853); Richardson, Ruth E (School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Cornell University, 527 College Ave, Hollister Hall, Ithaca, NY, USA 14853)",,"St. James, Andrew R (Cornell University); Richardson, Ruth E (Cornell University)",Cornell University,grid.5386.8,Ithaca,New York,United States,National Science Foundation; United States Department of Energy,NSF - National Science Foundation; US Federal Funders; DoE - United States Department of Energy,United States; United States,,,6,5,0.71,1.3,1,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125736360,31 Biological Sciences; 3107 Microbiology,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,

Habitat loss, overexploitation of resources, invasion and pollution are rapidly jeopardizing the survival of whole communities. It has been recently suggested that a potential approach to flatten the curve of species extinction and prevent catastrophic shifts would involve the engineering of one selected species within one of these communities. Such possibility has started to become part of potential intervention scenarios to preserve biodiversity. Despite its potential, very little is known about the actual dynamic responses of complex ecological networks to the introduction of a synthetic strains derived from a resident species. In this paper, we address this problem by modelling the response of a community to the addition of a synthetic strain derived from a member of a stable ecosystem. We show that the community interaction matrix largely limits the spread of the engineered strain, thus suggesting that species diversity acts as an ecological firewall. The implications for future scenarios of ecosystem engineering are outlined.

Most soil microorganisms live in periodically interconnected communities closely associated with soil aggregates, i.e., small (<2 mm), strongly bound clusters of minerals and organic carbon that persist through mechanical disruptions and wetting events. Their spatial structure is important for biogeochemical cycling, and we cannot reliably predict soil biological activities and variability by studying bulk soils alone. To fully understand the biogeochemical processes at work in soils, it is necessary to understand the micrometer-scale interactions that occur between soil particles and their microbial inhabitants. Here, we review the current state of knowledge regarding soil aggregate microbial communities and identify areas of opportunity to study soil ecosystems at a scale relevant to individual cells. We present a framework for understanding aggregate communities as ""microbial villages"" that are periodically connected through wetting events, allowing for the transfer of genetic material, metabolites, and viruses. We describe both top-down (whole community) and bottom-up (reductionist) strategies for studying these communities. Understanding this requires combining ""model system"" approaches (e.g., developing mock community artificial aggregates), field observations of natural communities, and broader study of community interactions to include understudied community members, like viruses.

Complex community interactions pose a major challenge to predicting ecosystem responses to environmental change because predictive frameworks require identification of mechanisms by which community interactions arise. Cavity-nesting communities are well suited for mechanistic studies of species interactions because cavity nesters interact through the creation of and competition for cavity-nest sites. In this study, we use a cavity-nest web as a predictive framework for identifying potential indirect species interactions within a cavity-nesting community. From 2002 to 2005, we monitored abundance and nests of cavity-nesting birds in the longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem. Using a nest-web approach, we identified a potential indirect interaction between the Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) and large secondary cavity nesters, mediated by the Northern Flicker (Colaptes auratus). We used structural equation modeling to test a path model of this interaction, using cavity excavation and enlargement as mechanisms which drive the relationship between these species. Through experimental manipulation of cavity availability, we blocked links described in our model, confirming cavity creation and enlargement as processes that influence community structure. We found that a single-species management technique could potentially disrupt this indirect relationship by affecting Northern Flicker cavity-excavation behavior. This study is the first demonstration of how experimental cavity manipulation can be used to test inferred processes derived from a nest web and highlights the need to understand how mechanisms underlying species interactions can complicate ecosystem responses to environmental change.","Acknowledgments Funding for this study was provided by D.O.D.

Interactions between the saprotrophic animal groups that strongly control soil microbial activities and the functioning of detrital food webs, such as earthworms and mesofauna, are not well understood. Earthworm trophic and engineering activities strongly affect mesofauna abundance and diversity through various direct and indirect pathways. In contrast, mesofauna effects on earthworm populations are less evident; however, their importance may be high, considering the keystone significance of earthworms for the functioning of the soil system. We studied effects of a diverse mesofauna community of a deciduous forest on two earthworm species representing epigeic (Lumbricus rubellus) and endogeic (Aporrectodea caliginosa) ecological groups. In microcosms, the density of total mesofauna or its separate groups (enchytraeids, collembolans, gamasid mites) was manipulated (increased) and responses of earthworms and soil systems were recorded. A rise in mesofauna density resulted in a decrease of biomass and an increased mortality in L. rubellus, presumably due to competition with mesofauna for litter resources. In contrast, similar mesofauna manipulations promoted reproduction of A. caliginosa, suggesting a facilitated exploitation of litter resources due to increased mesofauna activities. Changes of microcosm respiration rates, litter organic matter content and microbial activities across the manipulation treatments indicate that mesofauna modify responses of soil systems in the presence of earthworms. However, similar mesofauna manipulations could induce different responses in soil systems with either epigeic or endogeic lumbricids, which suggests that earthworm/mesofauna interactions are species-specific. Thus, mesofauna impacts should be treated as a factor affecting the engineering activities of epigeic and endogeic earthworms in the soil.",,,Oecologia,,Springer Nature,"0029-8549, 1432-1939",Animals; Biodiversity; Food Chain; Forests; Oligochaeta; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Species Specificity,2015-07-19,2015,2015-07-19,2015-11,179,3,877-887,Closed,Article,"Uvarov, Alexei V.; Karaban, Kamil","Uvarov, Alexei V.

Co-occurrence network analysis allows exploring the complex community interactions beyond the community diversities. This study explores the interspecific relationships within and between bacterial and fungal communities during composting of cow manure using co-occurrence network analysis. Furthermore, the keystone taxa that potentially exert a considerable impact on the microbiome were revealed by network analysis. The networks in the present study harbored more positive links. Specifically, the interactions/coupling within bacterial communities was tighter and the response to changes in external environmental conditions was more quickly during the composting process, while the fungal network had a better buffer capacity for changes in external environmental conditions. Interestingly, this result was authenticated in the bacterial-fungal (BF) network and the Mantel test of major modules and environmental variables. More than that, the Zi–Pi plot revealed that the keystone taxa including “module hubs” and “connectors” were all detected in these networks, which could prevent the dissociation of modules and networks.","This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 31672469), and Heilongjiang Province Education Department Fundamental Scientific Research Funds (Grant No. 135509318).","National Natural Science Foundation of China,31672469,Xiuhong Xu,Heilongjiang Province Education Department Fundamental Scientific Research Funds,135509318,Qingxin Meng",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,Springer Nature,"0944-1344, 1614-7499",Female; Cattle; Animals; Manure; Zea mays; Composting; Bacteria; Microbiota; Soil,2022-10-17,2022,2022-10-17,2023-02,30,8,20265-20276,Closed,Article,"Meng, Qingxin; Liu, Shuang; Guo, Yue; Hu, Yunlong; Yu, Zhidan; Bello, Ayodeji; Wang, Zhigang; Xu, Weihui; Xu, Xiuhong","Meng, Qingxin (School of Life Science and Agriculture and Forestry, Qiqihar University, 161006, Qiqihar, China; College of Resources and Environment, Northeast Agricultural University, 150030, Harbin, China); Liu, Shuang (School of Life Science and Agriculture and Forestry, Qiqihar University, 161006, Qiqihar, China); Guo, Yue (School of Life Science and Agriculture and Forestry, Qiqihar University, 161006, Qiqihar, China); Hu, Yunlong (School of Life Science and Agriculture and Forestry, Qiqihar University, 161006, Qiqihar, China); Yu, Zhidan (School of Life Science and Agriculture and Forestry, Qiqihar University, 161006, Qiqihar, China); Bello, Ayodeji (College of Resources and Environment, Northeast Agricultural University, 150030, Harbin, China); Wang, Zhigang (School of Life Science and Agriculture and Forestry, Qiqihar University, 161006, Qiqihar, China); Xu, Weihui (School of Life Science and Agriculture and Forestry, Qiqihar University, 161006, Qiqihar, China); Xu, Xiuhong (College of Resources and Environment, Northeast Agricultural University, 150030, Harbin, China)","Xu, Xiuhong (Northeast Agricultural University)","Meng, Qingxin (Qiqihar University; Northeast Agricultural University); Liu, Shuang (Qiqihar University); Guo, Yue (Qiqihar University); Hu, Yunlong (Qiqihar University); Yu, Zhidan (Qiqihar University); Bello, Ayodeji (Northeast Agricultural University); Wang, Zhigang (Qiqihar University); Xu, Weihui (Qiqihar University); Xu, Xiuhong (Northeast Agricultural University)",Northeast Agricultural University; Qiqihar University,grid.412243.2; grid.412616.6,Harbin; Qiqihar,; ,China; China,National Natural Science Foundation of China,,China,grant.8198013,31672469,2,2,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151951871,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3107 Microbiology,,,,,,C14 Geography and Environmental Studies,

Gut microbiota can prevent the occurrence of intestinal diseases in animals by regulating the homeostasis of the intestinal environment. The intestinal microbiota is a complex and stable microbial community, and the homeostasis of the intestinal environment is closely related to the invasion of intestinal pathogens, which plays an important role in protecting the host from pathogen infections. Probiotics are strains of microorganisms that are beneficial to health, and their potential has recently led to a significant increase in studies on the regulation of intestinal flora. Various potential mechanisms of action have been proposed on probiotics, especially mediating the regulation mechanism of the intestinal flora on the host, mainly including competitive inhibition of pathogens, stimulation of the host's adaptive immune system and regulation of the intestinal flora. The advent of high-throughput sequencing technology has given us a clearer understanding and has facilitated the development of research methods to investigate the intestinal microecological flora. This review will focus on the regulation of probiotics on the microbial flora of intestinal infections in livestock and poultry and will depict future research directions.","Acknowledgements This study was funded by the Anhui Natural Science Foundation (grant no. 2108085QC138), Key Research and Development Plan of Anhui Province (grant no. 202104f06020024) and Open fund project of Anhui Key Laboratory for Biodiversity Research and Ecological Protection in Southwest Anhui (grant no.

In the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, susceptibility of the resident microbial community to invasion by pathogens has important implications for host health. However, at the community level, it is unclear whether susceptibility to invasion depends mostly on resident community composition (which microbes are present), or also on local abiotic conditions (such as nutrient status). Here, we used a gut microcosm system to disentangle some of the drivers of susceptibility to invasion in microbial communities sampled from humans. We found resident microbial communities inhibited an invading Escherichia coli strain, compared to community-free control treatments, sometimes excluding the invader completely (colonization resistance). These effects were stronger at later time points, when we also detected altered community composition and nutrient availability. By separating these two components (microbial community and abiotic environment), we found taxonomic composition played a crucial role in suppressing invasion, but this depended critically on local abiotic conditions (adapted communities were more suppressive in nutrient-depleted conditions). This helps predict when resident communities will be most susceptible to invasion, with implications for optimizing treatments based on microbiota management.","We thank the Genetic Diversity Center and Jean-Claude Walser for sequencing and bioinformatic support, and Pauline Scanlan for helpful feedback.",,Proceedings of the Royal Society B,,The Royal Society,"0962-8452, 1471-2954",Animals; Ecology; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Microbiota,2021-03-24,2021,2021-03-24,2021-03-31,288,1947,20203106,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Baumgartner, Michael; Pfrunder-Cardozo, Katia R.; Hall, Alex R.","Baumgartner, Michael (Institute of Integrative Biology, Department of Environmental Systems Science, ETH Zürich, 8092 Zürich, Switzerland); Pfrunder-Cardozo, Katia R.

Empirical and theoretical studies on ecological networks suggest predator body size is a key factor structuring patterns of interaction. Because larger predators consume a wider resource range, including the prey consumed by smaller predators, we hypothesized that variation in body size favors the rise of nestedness. In contrast, if resource consumption requires specific adaptations, predators are expected to consume distinct sets of resources, thus favoring modularity. We investigate these predictions by characterizing the trophic network of a species-rich Amazonian snake community (62 species). Our results revealed an intricate network pattern resulting from larger species feeding on higher diversity of prey and therefore promoting nestedness, whereas snakes with specific lifestyles and feeding on distinct resources, promoting modularity. Species removal simulations indicated that the nested structure is favored mainly by the presence of five species of the family Boidae, which because of their body size and generalist lifestyles connect modules in the network. Our study highlights the particular ways traits affect the structure of interactions among consumers and resources at the community level.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank CAPES and the graduate program in ecology for project financial support, Laura Alencar for providing suggestions at different stages of this study, and two anonymous reviewers for their reviews.

While the microbial diversity of soil is enormous, the predominant bacterial phyla associated with plants include Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia. Plants supply nutrient niches for microbes, and microbes support plant functions such as plant growth, development, and stress tolerance. The interdependent interaction between the host plant and its microbes sculpts the plant microbiota. Plant and microbiome interactions are a good model system for understanding the traits in eukaryotic organisms from a holobiont perspective. The holobiont concept of plants, as a consequence of co-evolution of plant host and microbiota, treats plants as a discrete ecological unit assembled with their microbiota. Dissection of plant-microbiome interactions is highly complicated; however, some reductionist approaches are useful, such as the synthetic community method in a gnotobiotic system. Deciphering the interactions between plant and microbiome by this reductionist approach could lead to better elucidation of the functions of microbiota in plants. In addition, analysis of microbial communities’ interactions would further enhance our understanding of coordinated plant microbiota functions. Ultimately, better understanding of plantmicrobiome interactions could be translated to improvements in plant productivity.","This research was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MIST) (No. 2020R1A2C3005453, 2020R1A6A1A03047729, and 2020R1G1A1006624), Republic of Korea.",,Journal of Microbiology,,Springer Nature,"1225-8873, 1976-3794",Bacteria; Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; Microbial Interactions; Microbiota; Plant Physiological Phenomena; Plants; Soil Microbiology,2021-02-23,2021,2021-02-23,2021-03,59,3,281-291,Closed,Article,"Choi, Kihyuck; Khan, Raees; Lee, Seon-Woo","Choi, Kihyuck (Department of Applied Bioscience, Dong-A University, 49315, Busan, Republic of Korea); Khan, Raees (Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Medical Sciences, 46000, Rawalpindi, Pakistan); Lee, Seon-Woo (Department of Applied Bioscience, Dong-A University, 49315, Busan, Republic of Korea)","Lee, Seon-Woo (Dong-A University)","Choi, Kihyuck (Dong-A University); Khan, Raees (National University of Medical Sciences); Lee, Seon-Woo (Dong-A University)",Dong-A University; National University of Medical Sciences,grid.255166.3; grid.507958.6,Busan; Rawalpindi,; ,South Korea; Pakistan,Ministry of Science and ICT; National Research Foundation of Korea,,South Korea; South Korea,,,19,19,2.94,7.99,3,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1135663076,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3107 Microbiology,Genetics; Human Genome,,,,,A05 Biological Sciences,

We constructed bacterial communities with different diversity traits and employed exoenzyme activities (EEAs) and carbon acquisition potential (CAP) from substrates as proxies of bacterial functioning to test the independent effects of these two aspects of biodiversity. We expected that metabolic diversity, but not phylogenetic diversity would be associated with greater ecological function. Phylogenetically relatedness should intensify species interactions and coexistence, therefore amplifying the influence of metabolic diversity. We examined the effects of each diversity treatment using linear models, while controlling for the other, and found that phylogenetic diversity strongly influenced community functioning, positively and negatively. Metabolic diversity, however, exhibited negative or non-significant relationships with community functioning. When controlling for different substrates, EEAs increased along with phylogenetic diversity but decreased with metabolic diversity. The strength of diversity effects was related to substrate chemistry and the molecular mechanisms associated with each substrate's degradation. EEAs of phylogenetically similar groups were strongly affected by within-genus interactions. These results highlight the unique flexibility of microbial metabolic functions that must be considered in further ecological theory development.","We would like to express our gratitude to Patricia Geesink for the isolation of the groundwater bacteria.

Recent work has highlighted the potential for habitat disturbances to alter host-associated microbial communities, but the associations between anthropogenic disturbance, host microbiomes, and pathogens are unresolved. Amphibian skin microbial communities are particularly responsive to factors like temperature, physiochemistry, pathogen infection, and environmental microbial reservoirs. Through a field survey on wild populations of Acris crepitans (Hylidae) and Lithobates catesbeianus (Ranidae), we assessed the effects of habitat disturbance and connectivity on environmental bacterial reservoirs, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) infection, and skin microbiome composition. We found higher measures of microbiome dispersion (a measure of community variability) in A. crepitans from more disturbed ponds, supporting the hypothesis that disturbance increases stochasticity in biological communities. We also found that habitat disturbance limited microbiome similarity between locations for both species, suggesting greater isolation of bacterial assemblages in more disturbed areas. Higher disturbance was associated with lower Bd prevalence for A. crepitans, which could signify suboptimal microclimates for Bd in disturbed habitats. Combined, our findings show that reduced microbiome stability stemming from habitat disturbance could compromise population health, even in the absence of pathogenic infection.","We thank the landowners around Tuscaloosa that allowed access to their properties for sampling.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are key plant symbionts that can affect plant community dynamics and ecosystem stability. However, knowledge about how AM fungal communities respond to climate extremes in natural ecosystems remains elusive. Based on a grassland extreme drought experiment in Inner Mongolia, we investigated the response of AM fungal communities to extreme drought in association with plant communities. The experiment simulated two types of extreme drought (chronic/intense) of once-in-20-year occurrence. AM fungal richness and community composition exhibited high sensitivity to extreme drought and were more sensitive to intense drought than chronic drought. This community sensitivity (i.e. decline in richness and shifts in community composition) of AM fungi can be jointly explained by soil moisture, plant richness, and aboveground productivity. Notably, the robustness of the plant-AM fungal community co-response increased with drought intensity. Our results indicate that AM fungal communities are sensitive to climate extremes, and we propose that the plant community mediates AM fungal community responses. Given the ubiquitous nature of AM associations, their climate sensitivity may have profound consequences on plant communities and ecosystem stability under climate change.","Acknowledgements The authors thank all the staff in Erguna Forest‐Steppe Ecotone Research Station for their help during the experiment.

Metagenome sequencing and binning of streamer samples produced a 96% complete Thiomicrorhabdus sp. metagenome-assembled genome representing a possible new species or subspecies. This is the most cold- and salt-extreme source environment for a Thiomicrorhabdus genome yet described. Metaproteomic and metatranscriptomic analysis attributed nearly all gene expression in the streamers to the Thiomicrorhabdus sp. and suggested that it is active in CO2 fixation and oxidation of sulfide to elemental sulfur. In situ geochemical and isotopic analyses of the fractionation of multiple sulfur isotopes determined the biogeochemical transformation of sulfur from its source in Carboniferous evaporites to biotic processes occurring in the sediment and streamers. These complementary molecular tools provided a functional link between the geochemical substrates and the collective traits and activity that define the microbial community's interactions within a unique polar saline habitat where Thiomicrorhabdus-dominated streamers form and flourish.","This work was supported by a Polar Continental Shelf Project, NSERC Discovery Grant and Canada Research Chair Program to LGW.

Indoor surface microbial communities are formed from several sources, environmental and anthropogenic. In this study, we characterized the bacterial and fungal communities from various sources typical of a working office environment including dust, fingers, and computer keyboards and mice. The composition of the dust bacterial community was significantly different from the other tested surfaces (P < 0.05), whereas the dust fungal community was only significantly different from fingers (P < 0.05). Bacterial and fungal communities were both shaped by deterministic processes, and bacterial communities had a higher migration rate. Results of a network analysis showed that the microbial community interactions of keyboards and mice were mainly competitive. Fast expectation-maximization microbial source tracking (FEAST) identified the sources of > 70 % of the keyboard and mouse microbial communities. Biomarkers for each sample types were identified by LDA Effect Size (LEfSE) analysis, some of which were soil-derived and potential anthropogenic pathogens, indicating the potential for exchange of microbes among outdoor, human and indoor surfaces. The current study shows that the source of microorganisms at the office interface is highly traceable and that their migration is linked to human activity. The migration of potentially pathogenic microbes were identified, emphasising the importance of personal hygiene.","This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41807460, 41977210, 42021005 and U1805244).

To circumvent these challenges, we have created a 3D-bioprinted habitat that mimics aspects of natural soil aggregates while providing a chemically defined and translucent alternative culturing method for soil microorganisms. Our Synthetic Soil Aggregates (SSAs) retain the porosity, permeability, and patchy resource distribution of natural soil aggregates-parameters that are expected to influence emergent microbial community interactions. We demonstrate the printability and viability of several different microorganisms within SSAs and show how the SSAs can be integrated into a multi-omics workflow for single SSA resolution genomics, metabolomics, proteomics, lipidomics, and biogeochemical assays. We study the impact of the structured habitat on the distribution of a model co-culture microbial community and find that it is significantly different from the spatial organization of the same community in liquid culture, indicating a potential for SSAs to reproduce naturally occurring emergent community phenotypes. The SSAs have the potential as a tool to help researchers quantify microbial scale processes in situ and achieve high-resolution data from the interplay between environmental properties and microbial ecology.","We thank the editors and two anonymous reviewers for their feedback, which has improved this work.

However, a cognitive gap remains regarding the characteristics of the microbial community driven by phosphorus sources, especially co-occurrence patterns and community assembly based on phylogenetic group. In this study, 59 denitrifying phosphorus removal (DPR) activated sludge samples were cultivated with phosphorus sources. The results suggested that homogeneous selection accounted for the largest proportion that ranged from 35.82 to 64.48%. Deterministic processes dominated in 12 microbial groups (bins): Candidatus_Accumulibacter and Pseudomonas in these bins belonged to phosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs). Network analysis revealed that species interactions were intensive in cyclic nucleoside phosphate-influenced microbiota. Function prediction indicated that cyclic nucleoside phosphates increased the activity of enzymes related to denitrification and phosphorus metabolism and increased the α-diversity of microorganism but decreased the diversity of metabolic function. Based on these results, it was assumed that cyclic nucleoside phosphates, rather than inorganic phosphates, are the most available phosphorus source for majority microorganisms in DPR activated sludge.

Unlike other relevant human pathogens, Listeria monocytogenes has maintained a high rate of susceptibility to the antibiotics used for decades to treat human and animal infections. However, L. monocytogenes can acquire antibiotic resistance genes from other organisms' plasmids and conjugative transposons. Ecological factors could account for its susceptibility. L. monocytogenes is ubiquitous in nature, most frequently including reservoirs unexposed to antibiotics, including intracellular sanctuaries. L. monocytogenes has a remarkably closed genome, reflecting limited community interactions, small population sizes and high niche specialization. The L. monocytogenes species is divided into variants that are specialized in small specific niches, which reduces the possibility of coexistence with potential donors of antibiotic resistance. Interactions with potential donors are also hampered by interspecies antagonism. However, occasional increases in population sizes (and thus the possibility of acquiring antibiotic resistance) can derive from selection of the species based on intrinsic or acquired resistance to antibiotics, biocides, heavy metals or by a natural tolerance to extreme conditions. High-quality surveillance of the emergence of resistance to the key drugs used in primary therapy is mandatory.","This Review honors the scientific carrier of Prof. Pascale Cossart, based on her inexhaustible curiosity and passion for microbial life, and her exemplary, flawless experimental approaches.

We study here wheat straw decomposition under ambient and manipulated conditions simulating a future climate scenario (next 80 years) in agroecosystems, including decay rates, macronutrient dynamics, enzyme activity, and microbial communities. We show that future climate will accelerate straw decay rates only during the early phase of the decomposition process. Additionally, the projected climate change will increase the relative abundance of saprotrophic fungi in decomposing wheat straw. Moreover, the impact of future climate on microbial community assembly and molecular ecological networks of both bacteria and fungi will strongly depend on the decomposition phase. During the early phase of straw decomposition, stochastic processes dominated microbial assembly under ambient climate conditions, whereas deterministic processes highly dominated bacterial and fungal communities under simulated future climate conditions. In the later decomposition phase, similar assembly processes shaped the microbial communities under both climate scenarios. Furthermore, over the early phases of decomposition, simulated future climate enhanced the complexity of microbial interaction networks. We concluded that the impact of future climate on straw decay rate and associated microbial traits like assembly processes and inter-community interactions is restricted to the early phase of decomposition.","We acknowledge the Helmholtz Association, the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, the State Ministry of Science and Economy of Saxony‐Anhalt, and the State Ministry for Higher Education, Research and the Arts Saxony to fund the Global Change Experimental Facility (GCEF) project.

However, few studies have explored whether cross-community interactions are consistent or non-stationary across environmental gradients. Using the relative abundance of birds, aquatic macroinvertebrates and plants, we examined how cross-community congruence varied between short and long-hydroperiod prairie pothole wetlands in southern Alberta. These wetlands are structured by their hydroperiod: the length of time that ponded water is present in the wetland. We compared the strength of cross-community congruence and the strength of congruence between each horizontal community and wetland hydroperiod in wetlands that typically contain ponded water throughout the year to wetlands that dry up every summer. The strength of cross-community relationships was similar between more permanent and more ephemeral wetland classes, suggesting that biological interactions have a near equivalent role in shaping community composition, regardless of hydroperiod. However, because cross-community congruence, measured as the Procrustes pseudo-R value, was, on average, 77% ± SE 12% greater than that between each horizontal community and measures of wetland hydroperiod, we concluded that community structure is not shaped by hydroperiod alone. We attribute the observed cross-community congruence to (1) plants and aquatic macroinvertebrates influence birds through habitat and food provisioning, and (2) birds influence plants and aquatic macroinvertebrates by dispersing their propagules.","Funding for this research was supplied by Alberta Innovates and the Ontario Trillium Scholarship.

Using complex microbial consortia, MCF systems can be tuned to produce a range of biochemicals to meet market demand. However, the metabolic mechanisms and community interactions which drive biochemical production changes under differing conditions are currently poorly understood. These mechanisms are critical to useful MCF production models. Furthermore, predictable product transitions are currently limited to pH-driven changes between butyrate and ethanol, and chain-elongation (fed by lactate, acetate, and ethanol) to butyrate, valerate, and hexanoate. Lactate, a high-value biopolymer feedstock chemical, has been observed in transition states, but sustained production has not been described. In this study, steady state lactate production was achieved by increasing the organic loading rate of a butyrate-producing system from limiting to nonlimiting conditions at pH 5.5. Crucially, butyrate production resumed upon return to substrate-limited conditions. 16S ribosomal DNA community profiling combined with metaproteomics demonstrated that the butyrate-producing lineage Megasphaera redirected carbon flow through the methylglyoxal bypass when substrate was nonlimiting, which altered the community structure and metabolic expression toward lactate production. This metabolic mechanism can be included in future MCF models to describe the changes in product generation in substrate nonlimiting conditions.","The authors would like to thank Christy Grobbler for assistance with protein extractions, Amanda Nouwens for assistance with SWATH‐MS and protein identification, and Yang Lu for assistance with community profiling.

Due to the microbiome complexity, graph-theoretical approaches have been applied to represent model microbial communities interactions and identify important taxa, mainly in contaminated soils. Herein, we performed network and statistical analyses into microbial 16S rRNA gene sequencing data from soil samples with the application of different levels of composted tannery sludge (CTS) to assess the most connected nodes and the nodes that act as bridges to identify key microbes within each community. The network analysis revealed hubs belonging to Proteobacteria in soil with lower CTS rates, while active degraders of recalcitrant and pollutant chemical hubs belonging to Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were found in soils under the highest CTS rates. The majority of classified connectors belonged to Actinobacteria, but similarly to hubs taxa, they shifted from metabolic functional profile to taxa with abilities to degrade toxic compounds, revealing a soil perturbation with the CTS application on community organization, which also impacted the community modularity. Members of Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria were identified as both hub and connector suggesting their role as keystone groups. Thus, these results offered us interesting insights about crucial taxa, their response to environmental alterations, and possible implications for the ecosystem.","This research was supported by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico – CNPq/Brazil (grants 471347/2013-2; 305102/2014-1; 305069/2018-1).

This species produces non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs), including the hepatotoxin nodularin, often referred to as cyanotoxin. Several known classes of NRPs have various biological activities, although their modes of action are poorly understood. In the Baltic N. spumigena, there is a high NRP chemodiversity among strains, allowing their grouping in specific chemotypes and subgroups. Therefore, it is relevant to ask whether the NRP production is affected by intraspecific interactions between the co-existing strains. Using a novel approach that combines culture technique and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for the NRP analysis, we examined N. spumigena strains under mono- and co-culture conditions. The test strains were selected to represent N. spumigena belonging to the same or different chemotype subgroups. In this setup, we observed physiological and metabolic responses in the test strains grown without cell contact. The changes in NRP levels to co-culture conditions were conserved within a chemotype subgroup but different between the subgroups. Our results suggest that intraspecific interactions may promote a chemical diversity in N. spumigena population, with higher NRP production compared to a single-strain population. Studying allelochemical signalling in this cyanobacterium is crucial for understanding toxicity mechanisms and plankton community interactions in the Baltic Sea and other aquatic systems experiencing regular blooms.","We thank Katarzyna Sutryk (Division of Marine Biotechnology, Institute of Oceanography, University of Gdańsk, Poland) for providing technical and laboratory assistance.

Considerable efforts have been made toward elucidating the microbial diversity within FBT, but an understanding of the underlying FBT community interactions and functions remains poorly studied. Consequently, the microbial communities of two types of FBT, originating from Hunan and Shaanxi provinces, were investigated using comparative shotgun metagenomic sequencing and functional annotations. Metagenomic analysis indicated that two communities shared similar taxonomic and functional attributes. Two samples shared 486 genera, in which Pseudomonas contributed most to the abundant functions within the two samples. The carbohydrate active enzyme functions of the communities primarily comprised GH (32.92%), GT (26.8%), CEs (20.43%), and AAs (18.04%). Furthermore, the overall metabolic pathways encoded by the metagenomes were largely associated with carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, with nine metabolic pathways that were differential between two groups including penicillin and cephalosporin biosynthesis. Significantly, a total of 35 potential probiotics were inferred, with Pseudomonas putida being the most abundant inferred probiotic (80%) within the FBT communities.

Road salt is a widespread contaminant among freshwater ecosystems, yet a relatively understudied subject in community ecology. Unknown is whether road salt salinization interacts with predatory stress to influence the growth, behavior, or reproduction of freshwater organisms. Using rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and zooplankton (Daphnia pulex), we exposed them to variable levels of road salt (NaCl) crossed with the presence or absence of alarm cues or kairomones. Alarm cue reduced trout activity and aggression and increased shoaling behavior. Road salt reduced trout growth in the high compared to moderate salt concentration, but neither concentration was different from the control. There was no interaction between alarm cues and salt for trout. Road salt and predatory stress had an additive effect on Daphnia abundance. Predatory stress decreased Daphnia abundance by 11%. Compared to the control, salt decreased Daphnia abundance by 40% in 860 mg Cl−/L and 79% in 1300 mg Cl−/L, and by the final day abundance was reduced by 85% in 1300 mg Cl−/L. Road salt and predatory stress had an interactive effect on Daphnia reproduction. Predatory stress in control water and moderate salt levels (230 mg Cl−/L) increased sexual reproduction of Daphnia, but these responses disappeared at high salt concentrations. Thus, road salt could limit reproductive adaptations to natural and anthropogenic stressors in Daphnia. Our results indicate road salt salinization could alter zooplankton population dynamics directly and by interacting with predatory stress, which might affect energy flow through freshwater food webs.",,,Oecologia,,Springer Nature,"0029-8549, 1432-1939",Animals; Daphnia; Food Chain; Fresh Water; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Pheromones; Predatory Behavior; Reproduction; Salinity; Sodium Chloride; Zooplankton,2017-07-31,2017,2017-07-31,2017-09,185,1,147-156,Closed,Article,"Hintz, William D.; Relyea, Rick A.","Hintz, William D.

Predictions routinely focus on the direct effects of climate change on individual species, yet interactions between species can strongly influence how climate change affects organisms at every scale by altering their individual fitness, geographic ranges and the structure and dynamics of their community. Failure to incorporate these interactions limits the ability to predict responses of species to climate change.

Primary production in coral reef ecosystems proceeds rapidly through small packages. Maximum areal rates rival the best agricultures, but most of the organic production is conserved and recycled within component organisms and communities. Interactions with animals serve to maximize the productivity of both individual plants and extensive plant assemblages. The diverse aspects of the topic have attracted research for over 40 years.

1694,pub.1148518416,10.1093/icb/icac085,35675320,,,Patterns of Phenotypic Evolution Associated with Marine/Freshwater Transitions in Fishes.,"Evolutionary transitions between marine and freshwater ecosystems have occurred repeatedly throughout the phylogenetic history of fishes. The theory of ecological opportunity predicts that lineages that colonize species-poor regions will have greater potential for phenotypic diversification than lineages invading species-rich regions. Thus, transitions between marine and freshwaters may promote phenotypic diversification in trans-marine/freshwater fish clades. We used phylogenetic comparative methods to analyze body size data in nine major fish clades that have crossed the marine/freshwater boundary. We explored how habitat transitions, ecological opportunity, and community interactions influenced patterns of phenotypic diversity. Our analyses indicated that transitions between marine and freshwater habitats did not drive body size evolution, and there are few differences in body size between marine and freshwater lineages. We found that body size disparity in freshwater lineages is not correlated with the number of independent transitions to freshwaters. We found a positive correlation between body size disparity and overall species richness of a given area, and a negative correlation between body size disparity and diversity of closely related species. Our results indicate that the diversity of incumbent freshwater species does not restrict phenotypic diversification, but the diversity of closely related taxa can limit body size diversification. Ecological opportunity arising from colonization of novel habitats does not seem to have a major effect in the trajectory of body size evolution in trans-marine/freshwater clades. Moreover, competition with closely related taxa in freshwaters has a greater effect than competition with distantly related incumbent species.",,,Integrative and Comparative Biology,,Oxford University Press (OUP),"1540-7063, 1557-7023",Animals; Ecosystem; Fishes; Fresh Water; Phylogeny,2022-06-08,2022,2022-06-08,2022-08-25,62,2,406-423,Closed,Article,"de Brito, Victor; Betancur-R, Ricardo; Burns, Michael D; Buser, Thaddaeus J; Conway, Kevin W; Fontenelle, João Pedro; Kolmann, Matthew A; McCraney, W Tyler; Thacker, Christine E; Bloom, Devin D","de Brito, Victor (Department of Biological Sciences, Western Michigan University, 1903 W Michigan Ave, Kalamazoo, MI 49008-5410, USA.); Betancur-R, Ricardo (Department of Biology, University of Oklahoma, 730 Van Vleet Oval, Room 314, Norman, OK 73019, USA.); Burns, Michael D (Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Cornell Museum of Vertebrates, Cornell University, 159 Sapsucker Woods Road, Ithaca, NY 14850-1923, USA.); Buser, Thaddaeus J (Department of BioSciences, Rice University, W100 George R.

This contradiction is indicative of previously unrecognized mechanism that bridges the oxic and anoxic sediment layers. Using sediments from an urban river suffering from long-term polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) contamination, we analyzed the physicochemical and microbial responses to artificially elevated DO (eDO) in the overlying water over 9 weeks of incubation. Significant changes in key environmental parameters and microbial diversity were detected over the 0–6 cm sediment depth, along with accelerated degradation of PAHs, despite that eDO only increased the porewater DO in the millimeter subfacial layer. The dynamics of physicochemical and microbial properties coincided well with significantly increased presence of centimeter-long sulfide-oxidizing cable bacteria filaments under eDO, and were predominantly driven by cable bacteria metabolic activities. Phylogenetic ecological network analyses further revealed that eDO reinforced cable bacteria associated interspecific interactions with functional microorganisms such as sulfate reducers, PAHs degraders, and electroactive microbes, suggesting enhanced microbial syntrophy taking advantage of cable bacteria metabolism for the regeneration of SO42− and long-distance electron transfer. Together, our results suggest cable bacteria may mediate the impacts of eDO in anaerobic sediments by altering sediment physiochemical properties and by reinforcing community interactions. Our findings highlight the ecological importance of cable bacteria in sediments.","This work was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (91851202, 51678163), Guangdong Provincial Programs for Science and Technology Development (2019B110205004; 2018B020205003; 2018B030324002), GDAS’ Special Project of Science and Technology Development (2018GDASCX-0916, 2019GDASYL-0301002, 2021GDASYL-20210302001), and Guangdong MEPP Fund [NO.

Here, we examined the individual and combined effects of elevated temperature (+2 °C) and reduced pH (-0.2 units) on the biodiversity of coral reef communities that developed on standardized sampling units over a 2-y mesocosm experiment. Biodiversity and species composition were measured using amplicon sequencing libraries targeting the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) barcoding gene. Ocean-warming significantly increased species richness relative to present-day control conditions, whereas acidification significantly reduced richness. Contrary to expectations, species richness in the combined future ocean treatment with both warming and acidification was not significantly different from the present-day control treatment. Rather than the predicted collapse of biodiversity under the dual stressors, we find significant changes in the relative abundance but not in the occurrence of species, resulting in a shuffling of coral reef community structure among the highly species-rich cryptobenthic community. The ultimate outcome of altered community structure for coral reef ecosystems will depend on species-specific ecological functions and community interactions. Given that most species on coral reefs are members of the understudied cryptobenthos, holistic research on reef communities is needed to accurately predict diversity-function relationships and ecosystem responses to future climate conditions.","Funding was provided by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration’s Ocean Acidification Program and the NSF (OA#1416889 and OCE#1612307).

We examine the fate of this biological control agent (BCA) upon introduction in the soil, the effect on the banana root microbiota, and the influence on specific host genetic defense responses. While the presence of strain PICF7 significantly altered neither the composition nor the structure of the root microbiota, a significant shift in microbial community interactions through co-occurrence network analysis was observed. Despite the fact that PICF7 did not constitute a keystone, the topology of this network was significantly modified-the BCA being identified as a constituent of one of the main network modules in bacterized plants. Gene expression analysis showed the early suppression of several systemic acquired resistance and induced systemic resistance (ISR) markers. This outcome occurred at the time in which the highest relative abundance of PICF7 was detected. The absence of major and permanent changes on the banana holobiont upon PICF7 introduction poses advantages regarding the use of this beneficial rhizobacteria under field conditions. Indeed a BCA able to control the target pathogen while altering as little as possible the natural host-associated microbiome should be a requisite when developing effective bio-inoculants.","We are indebted to Teresa Cruz, Carmen de la Paz, and Leonardo Amador from CULTESA S.A., who provided banana plant material.","This study was supported by Project MUSA (Microbial Uptakes for Sustainable Management of Major Banana Pests and Diseases), funded by the EU’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program (grant agreement identifier: 727624).",Frontiers in Microbiology,,Frontiers,1664-302X,,2022-02-15,2022,2022-02-15,,13,,809126,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cabanás, Carmen Gómez-Lama; Wentzien, Nuria M.; Zorrilla-Fontanesi, Yasmín; Valverde-Corredor, Antonio; Fernández-González, Antonio J.; Fernández-López, Manuel; Mercado-Blanco, Jesús","Cabanás, Carmen Gómez-Lama (Departamento de Protección de Cultivos, Instituto de Agricultura Sostenible, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, Córdoba, Spain); Wentzien, Nuria M.

Flow conditions in rural SDGS are variable and their influences on bacteria in sewer biofilms are still not clear. To investigate the effect of flow conditions on sewage and greywater SDGS biofilms, six sewage SDGS and six greywater SDGS were operated and Illumina HiSeq sequencing was subsequently performed on sewer biofilms. The results indicate that the predominant bacterial phyla in both sewage and greywater SDGS biofilms were Proteobacteria (63.0% ± 9.3%) and Actinobacteria (26.5% ± 8.8%) and co-presence relationship was the main interaction in SDGS biofilm bacterial communities. Compared with stable flow conditions, variable flow conditions altered the bacterial community of SDGS biofilms from the aspect of bacteria compositions and community interactions and the relative abundance of many bacteria showed significant distinctions between stable and variable flow conditions. In sewage SDGS biofilm, the relative abundance of denitrifying, nitrite-oxidizing, and sulfate-reducing bacteria decreased significantly in variable flow conditions while in greywater SDGS biofilms, nitrite-oxidizing and water-related pathogenic bacteria decreased significantly in variable flow conditions. Influences of flow conditions on predicted bacterial functions were also significant in sewage and greywater SDGS biofilms. Variable flow conditions might be conducive to the reduction of H2S generation and water-related pathogenic bacteria in rural SDGS biofilms.","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers: 51838013, 51808536]; and the National Key RD Program of China [grant number: 2016YFC0400804].",,Environmental Research,,Elsevier,"0013-9351, 1096-0953","Bacteria; Biofilms; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water Movements",2020-02-22,2020,2020-02-22,2020-04,183,,109289,Closed,Article,"Li, Wenkai; Zheng, Tianlong; Ma, Yingqun; Liu, Junxin","Li, Wenkai (State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 18 Shuangqing Road, Haidian District, Beijing, 100085, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 19 (A) Yuquan Road, Shijingshan District, Beijing, 100049, China.); Zheng, Tianlong (State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 18 Shuangqing Road, Haidian District, Beijing, 100085, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 19 (A) Yuquan Road, Shijingshan District, Beijing, 100049, China.

In early stage of this study, the organic fertilizer fermented by Bama pig manure applied in soil was proved to significantly inhibit the occurrence of disease by improving the structure of soil microbial community. However, the mechanism was not clear. The high-throughput sequencing technology, combined with network and PICRUSt2 function analysis was used to investigate it. MiSeq sequencing showed that the bacterial community of organic fertilizer treated soil was composed of 34 phyla and 768 genera, the number of genera was higher than that of sterile water treated soil. Fertilization significantly increased the diversity and changed the composition of bacterial community based on alpha, beta diversity, and ANOSIM/Adonis analysis. LEfSe species difference and network analysis showed that fertilization improved the relative abundance of bacteria with biological control or plant growth promotion characteristics in soil, such as Sphingomonas, Halobacillus, Nocardioides, and enhanced the interaction between rhizosphere bacteria, made the network structure more complex. PICRUSt2 also revealed fertilization promoted the bacterial function, such as metabolism and genetic information processing. These results showed that the pig manure organic fertilizer might reduce the occurrence of Fusarium wilt by regulating bacterial community, interaction, and functional metabolism in watermelon rhizosphere soil.",The authors would like to acknowledge Dr. Xiang Wang for sharing the idea of this work and Proof-Reading-Service for language editing.,"This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Henan Province (212300410215), the National Natural Science Fund of China (U2004145), the key research and development projects of Henan Province (221111520600), the higher discipline innovation and talent introduction base of Henan Province (No. CXJD2019001) and the High-qualified Talents Scientific Research Startup Foundation of Nanyang Normal University (2019ZX015).",Current Microbiology,,Springer Nature,"0343-8651, 1432-0991",Animals; Bacteria; Citrullus; Fertilizers; Fusarium; Manure; Plant Diseases; Rhizosphere; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Swine; Water,2022-10-17,2022,2022-10-17,2022-12,79,12,364,Closed,Article,"Zhang, Hao; Yang, Huiying; Zhang, Xin; Sun, Jie; Dong, Lianzheng; Han, Hui; Chen, Zhaojin","Zhang, Hao (School of Life Science and Agricultural Engineering, Research Center of Henan Provincial Agricultural Biomass Resource Engineering and Technology, Henan Province Artemisiae Argyi Development and Utilization Engineering Technology Research Center, Innovation Center of Water Security for Water Source Region of Mid-Route Project of South-North Water Diversion of Henan Province, Nanyang Normal University, 473061, Nanyang, People’s Republic of China); Yang, Huiying (School of Life Science and Agricultural Engineering, Research Center of Henan Provincial Agricultural Biomass Resource Engineering and Technology, Henan Province Artemisiae Argyi Development and Utilization Engineering Technology Research Center, Innovation Center of Water Security for Water Source Region of Mid-Route Project of South-North Water Diversion of Henan Province, Nanyang Normal University, 473061, Nanyang, People’s Republic of China); Zhang, Xin (School of Life Science and Agricultural Engineering, Research Center of Henan Provincial Agricultural Biomass Resource Engineering and Technology, Henan Province Artemisiae Argyi Development and Utilization Engineering Technology Research Center, Innovation Center of Water Security for Water Source Region of Mid-Route Project of South-North Water Diversion of Henan Province, Nanyang Normal University, 473061, Nanyang, People’s Republic of China); Sun, Jie (School of Life Science and Agricultural Engineering, Research Center of Henan Provincial Agricultural Biomass Resource Engineering and Technology, Henan Province Artemisiae Argyi Development and Utilization Engineering Technology Research Center, Innovation Center of Water Security for Water Source Region of Mid-Route Project of South-North Water Diversion of Henan Province, Nanyang Normal University, 473061, Nanyang, People’s Republic of China); Dong, Lianzheng (School of Life Science and Agricultural Engineering, Research Center of Henan Provincial Agricultural Biomass Resource Engineering and Technology, Henan Province Artemisiae Argyi Development and Utilization Engineering Technology Research Center, Innovation Center of Water Security for Water Source Region of Mid-Route Project of South-North Water Diversion of Henan Province, Nanyang Normal University, 473061, Nanyang, People’s Republic of China); Han, Hui (School of Life Science and Agricultural Engineering, Research Center of Henan Provincial Agricultural Biomass Resource Engineering and Technology, Henan Province Artemisiae Argyi Development and Utilization Engineering Technology Research Center, Innovation Center of Water Security for Water Source Region of Mid-Route Project of South-North Water Diversion of Henan Province, Nanyang Normal University, 473061, Nanyang, People’s Republic of China); Chen, Zhaojin (School of Water Resources and Environmental Engineering, Nanyang Normal University, 473061, Nanyang, People’s Republic of China)","Chen, Zhaojin (Nanyang Normal University)","Zhang, Hao (Nanyang Normal University); Yang, Huiying (Nanyang Normal University); Zhang, Xin (Nanyang Normal University); Sun, Jie (Nanyang Normal University); Dong, Lianzheng (Nanyang Normal University); Han, Hui (Nanyang Normal University); Chen, Zhaojin (Nanyang Normal University)",Nanyang Normal University,grid.453722.5,Nanyang,,China,National Natural Science Foundation of China; Nanyang Normal University,,China; China,,,0,0,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151953484,31 Biological Sciences; 3107 Microbiology,,,,,,"A06 Agriculture, Veterinary and Food Science",2 Zero Hunger

Viral lysis and grazing have very different effects on microbial community dynamics and carbon export, yet, very little is known about the relative magnitude and ecological impact of viral lysis on natural phytoplankton communities, especially in Antarctic waters. Here, we report on the temporal dynamics and relative importance of viral lysis rates, in comparison to grazing, for Antarctic nano- and pico-sized phytoplankton of varied taxonomy and size over a full productive season. Our results show that viral lysis was a major loss factor throughout the season, responsible for roughly half (58%) of seasonal phytoplankton carbon losses. Viral lysis appeared critically important for explaining temporal dynamics and for obtaining a complete seasonal mass balance of Antarctic phytoplankton. Group-specific responses indicated a negative correlation between grazing and viral losses in Phaeocystis and picoeukaryotes, while for other phytoplankton groups losses were more evenly spread throughout the season. Cryptophyte mortality was dominated by viral lysis, whereas small diatoms were mostly grazed. Larger diatoms dominated algal carbon flow and a single ‘lysis event’ directed >100% of daily carbon production away from higher trophic levels. This study highlights the need to consider viral lysis of key Antarctic phytoplankton for a better understanding of microbial community interactions and more accurate predictions of organic matter flux in this climate-sensitive region.",We thank the British Antarctic Survey for their logistical support and cooperation during the field campaign as well as Zoi Farenzena for field assistance.

Lack of water significantly impacts cellular response, which can be partially compensated for through community interactions and accessing survival means beyond the cell's boundaries. In the present study, higher numbers of cultivable Gram-positive Arthrobacter sp. and Gram-negative Pseudomonas stutzeri cells were found on surfaces when high population density was used after prolonged periods of desiccation and nutrient starvation. Total cell counts during desiccation periods decreased slower than culturable cell counts independently from initial population density. The presence of homogenate, prepared by filtering homogenized cultures through a 0.2 µm filter, extended culturability of Arthrobacter sp. cells, while intact heat-killed cells extended the culturability of Arthrobacter sp. and P. stutzeri. Our results suggest very slow cell membrane breakdown for desiccated bacterial cells at solid-air interfaces over extended time spans, which may serve as reservoirs of nutrients, and may potentially provide trace amounts of water for surviving cells. Higher initial population density and recycling of resources from ""zombie""-like cells, may support growth in a similar fashion as access to cell lysates or the contents of heat-killed cells analogous to dead-phase cultures where some cells experience cryptic growth.",The authors would like to acknowledge the Nuclear Waste Management Organization of Canada and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada for research funding.

To predict the effects of copper on a plant-herbivore interaction in a freshwater ecosystem, we built a model that focuses on the interaction between an alga, Scenedesmus sp., and a herbivore, Daphnia sp. The model assumes logistic growth for Scenedesmus and a type II functional response for Daphnia. Internal copper concentrations in Scenedesmus and Daphnia are calculated using a biodynamic model. We include two types of direct effects of copper on Scenedesmus and Daphnia that results from hormesis: a deficiency effect at low concentration and a toxic effect at high concentration. We perform a numerical analysis to predict the combined effects of copper and nutrient enrichment on the Scenedesmus-Daphnia interaction. Results show three types of outcomes depending on copper concentration. First, low (4 μg L(-1)) and high (50 μg L(-1)) copper concentrations cause deficiency and toxicity, respectively, leading to the extinction of all populations; for less extreme concentrations (between 4 and 5 μg L(-1) and between 16.5 and 50 μg L(-1)), only the consumer population becomes extinct. The two populations survive with intermediate concentrations. Second, when population dynamics present oscillations, copper has a stabilizing effect and reduces or suppresses oscillations. Third, copper, on account of its stabilizing effect, opposes the destabilizing effect of nutrient enrichment. Our model shows that (1) Daphnia is affected by copper at lower concentrations when community interactions are taken into account than when analyzed alone, and (2) counterintuitive effects may arise from the interaction between copper pollution and nutrient enrichment. Our model also suggests that single-value parameters such as NOEC and LOEC, which do not take community interactions into account to characterize pollutants effects, are unable to determine pollutant effects in complex ecosystems. More generally, our model underscores the importance of ecosystem-scale studies to predict the effects of pollutants.","This work was financially supported by the PULSE project ANR-2010-CEPL-010-04.

These 3D spatial maps revealed that the chemical environments differ between patients and within the lungs of each patient. Although the microbial ecosystems of the patients were defined by the dominant pathogen, their chemical diversity was not. Additionally, the chemical diversity between locales in the lungs of the same individual sometimes exceeded interindividual variation. Thus, the chemistry and microbiome of the explanted lungs appear to be not only personalized but also regiospecific. Previously undescribed analogs of microbial quinolones and antibiotic metabolites were also detected. Furthermore, mapping the chemical and microbial distributions allowed visualization of microbial community interactions, such as increased production of quorum sensing quinolones in locations where Pseudomonas was in contact with Staphylococcus and Granulicatella, consistent with in vitro observations of bacteria isolated from these patients. Visualization of microbe-metabolite associations within a host organ in early-stage CF disease in animal models will help elucidate the complex interplay between the presence of a given microbial structure, antibiotics, metabolism of antibiotics, microbial virulence factors, and host responses.IMPORTANCE Microbial infections are now recognized to be polymicrobial and personalized in nature. Comprehensive analysis and understanding of the factors underlying the polymicrobial and personalized nature of infections remain limited, especially in the context of the host. By visualizing microbiomes and metabolomes of diseased human lungs, we reveal how different the chemical environments are between hosts that are dominated by the same pathogen and how community interactions shape the chemical environment or vice versa. We highlight that three-dimensional organ mapping methods represent hypothesis-building tools that allow us to design mechanistic studies aimed at addressing microbial responses to other microbes, the host, and pharmaceutical drugs.","Y.V.-B. is funded by the Janssen Human Microbiome Initiative through the Center for Microbiome Innovation at UC San Diego.

Pathogens and immune challenges can induce changes in host phenotype in ways that indirectly impact important community interactions, including those that affect host-pathogen interactions. 2. To explore host behavioural response to immune challenge, we exposed wild white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) to an immunogen from an endemic, zoonotic pathogen, the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. White-footed mice are a major reservoir host of Lyme disease (LD) spirochetes in northeastern USA and an abundant member of forest communities. The activity patterns, foraging behaviour, and space use of white-footed mice have implications for population growth rates of community members upon which mice incidentally prey (i.e. gypsy moths and native thrushes), as well as potentially determining host-vector encounter rates and human risk of LD. 3. Immunochallenge led to specific humoral (antibody) and cellular (i.e. elevated neutrophils and eosinophils) immune responses, supporting use of the immunogen as a surrogate for pathogenic infection. 4. Immunochallenged mice had reduced wheel-running activity early in the night when measured in the lab. However, mouse activity, as measured by track plates in natural field experiments, did not differ between mice exposed to the immunogen and unexposed mice. 5. Foraging behaviour of wild mice in the field - assessed with giving-up densities of seed at artificial feeding stations - was affected by exposure to the immunogen. Whereas immunochallenge did not influence whether foraging mice gained information on patch quality while foraging, it led to reductions in predator avoidance during foraging, suggesting that the proportion of space used by foraging mice may be greater as a result of immunochallenge. This increased space use is predicted to increase encounter rates with patchily distributed LD vectors (ticks) and with incidental prey items. 6. Thus, immunochallenge in white-footed mice, and potentially pathogenic infection, have the potential to indirectly impact community interactions, including those important for pathogen transmission.",,,Journal of Animal Ecology,,Wiley,"0021-8790, 1365-2656","Animals; Borrelia burgdorferi; Disease Reservoirs; Feeding Behavior; Female; Human Activities; Humans; Immunity, Cellular; Immunity, Humoral; Ixodes; Male; Mice; Moths; Peromyscus; Sex Characteristics",2010-08-26,2010,2010-08-26,2011-01,80,1,204-214,All OA; Green,Article,"Schwanz, Lisa E.; Brisson, Dustin; Gomes‐Solecki, Maria; Ostfeld, Richard S.","Schwanz, Lisa E.

We are all living in a complex environment, interacting not only with our peers, but as true holobionts; we are also very much in interaction with our coexisting microbial ecosystems living on and especially within us, in the intestine. Intestinal microorganisms, often collectively referred to as intestinal microbiota, contribute significantly to our daily energy uptake by breaking down complex carbohydrates into simple sugars, which are fermented to short-chain fatty acids and subsequently absorbed by human cells. They also have an impact on our immune system, by suppressing or enhancing the growth of malevolent and beneficial microbes. Our lifestyle can have a large influence on this ecosystem. What and how much we consume can tip the ecological balance in the intestine. A “western diet” containing mainly processed food will have a different effect on our health than a balanced diet fortified with pre- and probiotics.In recent years, new technologies have emerged, which made a more detailed understanding of microbial communities and ecosystems feasible. This includes progress in the sequencing of PCR-amplified phylogenetic marker genes as well as the collective microbial metagenome and metatranscriptome, allowing us to determine with an increasing level of detail, which microbial species are in the microbiota, understand what these microorganisms do and how they respond to changes in lifestyle and diet. These new technologies also include the use of synthetic and in vitro systems, which allow us to study the impact of substrates and addition of specific microbes to microbial communities at a high level of detail, and enable us to gather quantitative data for modelling purposes.Here, we will review the current state of microbiome research, summarizing the computational methodologies in this area and highlighting possible outcomes for personalized nutrition and medicine.","The authors want to thank Ruben van Heck, Maria Suarez-Diez (Wageningen University and Research, Laboratory of Systems and Synthetic Biology), Joan Edwards and Gerben Hermes (Wageningen University and Research, Laboratory of Microbiology) for helpful discussions.",,Genes & Nutrition,,Springer Nature,"1555-8932, 1865-3499",,2018-03-06,2018,2018-03-06,2018-12,13,1,5,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hornung, Bastian; Martins dos Santos, Vitor A.

The organization of the gut microbiome is assumed to be a singular assortative network, where interactions between operational taxonomic units (OTUs) can readily be clustered into segregated and distinct communities. Here, we leverage recent methodological advances in network modeling to assess whether communities in the human microbiome exhibit a single network structure or whether co-existing mesoscale network architectures are present. We found evidence for core-periphery structures in the microbiome, supported by strong, assortative community interactions. This complex architecture, coupled with previously reported functional roles of OTUs, provides a nuanced understanding of how the microbiome simultaneously promotes high microbial diversity and maintains functional redundancy.","We thank S.

We examined anthropogenic effects on mammal diel activity patterns, conducting a meta-analysis of 76 studies of 62 species from six continents. Our global study revealed a strong effect of humans on daily patterns of wildlife activity. Animals increased their nocturnality by an average factor of 1.36 in response to human disturbance. This finding was consistent across continents, habitats, taxa, and human activities. As the global human footprint expands, temporal avoidance of humans may facilitate human-wildlife coexistence. However, such responses can result in marked shifts away from natural patterns of activity, with consequences for fitness, population persistence, community interactions, and evolution.","We thank the authors of all studies included in this meta-analysis, especially those who provided additional data: A.

The sequestration of essential iron has emerged as a crucial innate defense system termed nutritional immunity, leading pathogens to evolve mechanisms of 'iron piracy' to scavenge this metal from host proteins. This battle for iron carries numerous consequences not only for host-pathogen evolution but also microbial community interactions. Here we highlight recent and potential future areas of investigation on the evolutionary implications of microbial iron piracy in relation to molecular arms races, host range, competition, and virulence.

When analysing global epidemics this force us to consider metapopulation models taking into account intra- and inter-community interactions. Here I introduce and analyze a metapopulation model which accounts for several features observed in real outbreaks. First, I demonstrate that depending on the intra-community expected outbreak size and the fraction of social bridges the epidemic outbreaks die out or there is a finite probability to observe a global epidemics. Second, I show that the global scenario is characterized by resurgent epidemics, their number increasing with increasing the intra-community average distance between individuals.

These communities span in scale from small, multicellular aggregates to billions or trillions of cells within the gastrointestinal tract of animals. The dynamics of bacterial communities are determined by pairwise interactions that occur between different species in the community. Though interactions occur between a few cells at a time, the outcomes of these interchanges have ramifications that ripple through many orders of magnitude, and ultimately affect the macroscopic world including the health of host organisms. In this review we cover how bacterial competition influences the structures of bacterial communities. We also emphasize methods and insights garnered from culture-dependent pairwise interaction studies, metagenomic analyses, and modeling experiments. Finally, we argue that the integration of multiple approaches will be instrumental to future understanding of the underlying dynamics of bacterial communities.","We thank Alfredo Erazo-Oliveras, Chris Hoefler, Ashley Mattison, Yongjin Liu, and Chengxi Zhang for feedback and support during the preparation of this manuscript.",Funding.

Given physiological context, changes in gut microbial community structure are increasingly found to associate with alterations in enteric neurotransmission and disease. At present, it is not known whether shifts in microbial community dynamics represent cause or consequence of disease pathogenesis. The discovery of bacterial-derived neurotransmitters suggests further studies are needed to establish their role in enteric neuropathy. This mini-review highlights recent advances in bacterial communications to the autonomic nervous system and discusses emerging epigenetic data showing that diet, probiotic and antibiotic use may regulate enteric neurotransmission through modulation of microbial communities.

However, research questions and experiments often focus on only a limited number of interactions, creating an incomplete picture of how entire communities may be involved in AG-BG community ecology. Therefore, a pressing challenge is to formulate hypotheses of AG-BG interactions when considering communities in their full complexity.

Functional plant traits provide a means whereby species identity can influence belowground community interactions, but little work has examined whether species identity influences belowground community processes when correcting for evolutionary history. Specifically, we hypothesized that closely related species would exhibit (i) more similar leaf and root functional traits than more distantly related species, and (ii) more similar associated soil arthropod communities. We found that after correcting for evolutionary history, tree species identity influenced belowground arthropod communities through plant functional traits. These data suggest that plant species structure may be an important predictor in shaping associated soil arthropod communities and further suggest the importance of better understanding the extended consequences of evolutionary history on ecological processes, as similarity in traits may not always reflect similar ecology.",We thank Jeremy Beaulieu for providing the phylogeny.

BEVs play important roles in the microbial community interactions and host-microbe interactions. Markedly, BEVs can be delivered to host cells, thus modulating the development and function of the innate immune system. To clarify the compositions and biological functions of BEVs, we need to collect these vesicles with high purity and bioactivity. Here we propose an isolation strategy based on a broad-spectrum antimicrobial epsilon-poly-L-lysine (ϵ-PL) to precipitate BEVs at a relatively low centrifugal speed (10,000 × g). Compared to the standard ultracentrifugation strategy, our method can enrich BEVs from large volumes of media inexpensively and rapidly. The precipitated BEVs can be recovered by adjusting the pH and ionic strength of the media, followed by an ultrafiltration step to remove ϵ-PL and achieve buffer exchange. The morphology, size, and protein composition of the ϵ-PL-precipitated BEVs are comparable to those purified by ultracentrifugation. Moreover, ϵ-PL-precipitated BEVs retained the biological activity as observed by confocal microscopy studies. And THP-1 cells stimulated with these BEVs undergo marked reprogramming of their transcriptome. KEGG analysis of the differentially expressed genes showed that the signal pathways of cellular inflammatory response were significantly activated. Taken together, we provide a new method to rapidly enrich BEVs with high purity and bioactivity, which has the potential to be applied to BEVs-related immune response studies.",,This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2021YFE0109300).,Frontiers in Immunology,,Frontiers,1664-3224,Anti-Bacterial Agents; Culture Media; Extracellular Vesicles; Host Microbial Interactions; Polylysine,2022-08-12,2022,2022-08-12,,13,,930510,All OA; Gold,Article,"Wei, Shujin; Jiao, Dian; Xing, Wanli","Wei, Shujin (School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China); Jiao, Dian (School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China); Xing, Wanli (School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China)","Xing, Wanli (Tsinghua University)","Wei, Shujin (Tsinghua University); Jiao, Dian (Tsinghua University); Xing, Wanli (Tsinghua University)",Tsinghua University,grid.12527.33,Beijing,Beijing,China,Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China,,China,,,2,2,,,3,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2022.930510/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150186065,31 Biological Sciences; 3101 Biochemistry and Cell Biology,,Inflammatory and immune system,,,,"A03 Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy",

In some cases, behavior plays an additional, but less understood, role in the development and persistence of mutualisms. In soft-sediment marine habitats along the western Atlantic, the native decorator worm Diopatra cuprea anchors the non-native red alga Gracilaria vermiculophylla to its tube cap in a mutualism. To understand whether the worm’s usage of G. vermiculophylla could represent a preference, we first surveyed the species composition of macrophytes affixed to worm tube caps at three sites in coastal Virginia, USA using transect and quadrat sampling. These unmanipulated field surveys supported previous work revealing variable, but often high frequencies (31–98%) of D. cuprea decoration with G. vermiculophylla. We next used field manipulations and controlled laboratory experiments to test the consistency of individual D. cuprea decoration with G. vermiculophylla versus three common macrophytes (Ulva sp., Agardhiella sp., and Spartina alterniflora) found in our field surveys. Twenty-four hours after removing the worm’s tube cap in the field, D. cuprea decoration was dominated by both G. vermiculophylla (39.6%) and S. alterniflora (25.9%). When provided a choice of macrophytes in the laboratory, individual D. cuprea consistently decorated with G. vermiculophylla (58.7%) over the other macrophytes, showing a preference for the non-native macrophyte. Our study suggests that preference can drive strong and steadfast interactions between native and non-native organisms, facilitating the latter’s persistence and spread, change available habitat, and alter community interactions.","We thank the Virginia Institute of Marine Science Eastern Shore Lab, in particular C.

In this study, we used a seven-year controlled grazing experiment to quantify the response of plant and soil properties and their interactions with soil microbial communities to moderate grazing in a semiarid grassland of Northern China. Our results showed that moderate grazing reduced the richness and diversity of soil microbial communities, as well as weakened community interactions. However, bacterial communities and their linkages were more stable under moderate grazing than fungal communities. Changes in aboveground plant biomass, soil water content, NO3--N, and NO3/NH4 ratio dominated grazing effects on soil bacterial communities, while fungal communities were mainly influenced by plant N, soil NO3--N, and NO3/NH4 ratio. Changes in the plant community composition played a key role in driving the composition of the fungal community. Our results provide a new insight into the response of soil microbes to moderate grazing, and suggest that above- and belowground communities should be considered to be precise indicators of the state and characteristics of the grassland ecosystem.","We thank Haobitai and other team members for their assistance with field experiments.

Despite the importance of secondary metabolites in human health and microbial ecology, little is known about their roles and regulation in the context of multispecies communities. In a simplified model of the rhizosphere composed of Bacillus cereus, Flavobacterium johnsoniae, and Pseudomonas koreensis, we show that the dynamics of secondary metabolism depend on community species composition and interspecies interactions. Comparative metatranscriptomics and metametabolomics reveal that the abundance of transcripts of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and metabolomic molecular features differ between monocultures or dual cultures and a tripartite community. In both two- and three-member cocultures, P. koreensis modified expression of BGCs for zwittermicin, petrobactin, and other secondary metabolites in B. cereus and F. johnsoniae, whereas the BGC transcriptional response to the community in P. koreensis itself was minimal. Pairwise and tripartite cocultures with P. koreensis displayed unique molecular features that appear to be derivatives of lokisin, suggesting metabolic handoffs between species. Deleting the BGC for koreenceine, another P. koreensis metabolite, altered transcript and metabolite profiles across the community, including substantial up-regulation of the petrobactin and bacillibactin BGCs in B. cereus, suggesting that koreenceine represses siderophore production. Results from this model community show that bacterial BGC expression and chemical output depend on the identity and biosynthetic capacity of coculture partners, suggesting community composition and microbiome interactions may shape the regulation of secondary metabolism in nature.","This study was supported by the US Army Research Laboratory and the US Army Research Office under Contract/Grant W911NF1910269.

We analyzed the bacterial communities of 370 air particulate samples collected from 63 sites around the world and constructed an airborne bacterial reference catalog with more than 27 million nonredundant 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences. We present their biogeographic pattern and decipher the interlacing of the microbiome co-occurrence network with surface environments of the Earth. While the total abundance of global airborne bacteria in the troposphere (1.72 × 1024 cells) is 1 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of other habitats, the number of bacterial taxa (i.e., richness) in the atmosphere (4.71 × 108 to 3.08 × 109) is comparable to that in the hydrosphere, and its maximum occurs in midlatitude regions, as is also observed in other ecosystems. The airborne bacterial community harbors a unique set of dominant taxa (24 species); however, its structure appears to be more easily perturbed, due to the more prominent role of stochastic processes in shaping community assembly. This is corroborated by the major contribution of surface microbiomes to airborne bacteria (averaging 46.3%), while atmospheric conditions such as meteorological factors and air quality also play a role. Particularly in urban areas, human impacts weaken the relative importance of plant sources of airborne bacteria and elevate the occurrence of potential pathogens from anthropogenic sources. These findings serve as a key reference for predicting planetary microbiome responses and the health impacts of inhalable microbiomes with future changes in the environment.","We thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (92043302), the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB40020102), and the Hong Kong Research Grants Council (15210618,15203920 and T21-705/20-N) for funding this study.

Extracellular vesicles of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans are vital for biofilm communities to produce matrix, which confers environmental protection and modulates community dispersion. Infections are increasingly due to diverse Candida species, such as the emerging pathogen Candida auris, as well as mixed Candida communities. Here, we define the composition and function of biofilm-associated vesicles among five species across the Candida genus. We find similarities in vesicle size and release over the biofilm lifespan. Whereas overall cargo proteomes differ dramatically among species, a group of 36 common proteins is enriched for orthologs of C. albicans biofilm mediators. To understand the function of this set of proteins, we asked whether mutants in select components were important for key biofilm processes, including drug tolerance and dispersion. We found that the majority of these cargo components impact one or both biofilm processes across all five species. Exogenous delivery of wild-type vesicle cargo returned mutant phenotypes toward wild type. To assess the impact of vesicle cargo on interspecies interactions, we performed cross-species vesicle addition and observed functional complementation for both biofilm phenotypes. We explored the biologic relevance of this cross-species biofilm interaction in mixed species and mutant studies examining the drug-resistance phenotype. We found a majority of biofilm interactions among species restored the community's wild-type behavior. Our studies indicate that vesicles influence the development of protective monomicrobial and mixed microbial biofilm communities.",D.A. and A.P.M. were funded by R01AI073289.

However, the interactions between the components within holobionts and between a holobiont and environment are largely unknown, especially for polar organisms. To investigate possible interactions within and between sponge-associated communities, we probed the microbiomes and viromes of cold-water sympatric sponges Isodictya palmata (n = 2), Halichondria panicea (n = 3), and Halichondria sitiens (n = 3) by 16S and shotgun metagenomics. We showed that the bacterial and viral communities associated with these White Sea sponges are species-specific and different from the surrounding water. Extensive mining of bacterial antiphage defense systems in the metagenomes revealed a variety of defense mechanisms. The abundance of defense systems was comparable in the metagenomes of the sponges and the surrounding water, thus distinguishing the White Sea sponges from those inhabiting the tropical seas. We developed a network-based approach for the combined analysis of CRISPR-spacers and protospacers. Using this approach, we showed that the virus-host interactions within the sponge-associated community are typically more abundant (three out of four interactions studied) than the inter-community interactions. Additionally, we detected the occurrence of viral exchanges between the communities. Our work provides the first insight into the metagenomics of the three cold-water sponge species from the White Sea and paves the way for a comprehensive analysis of the interactions between microbial communities and associated viruses.","We thank the personnel of the White Sea Biological Station, particularly, Alexander Tzetlin and Tatyana Neretina for the opportunity to collect and process samples at WSBS, WSBS SCUBA diving team for samples collection, and Boris Osadchenko for identification of sponge species.",,Life,,MDPI,2075-1729,,2021-12-24,2021,2021-12-24,,12,1,25,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rusanova, Anastasiia; Fedorchuk, Victor; Toshchakov, Stepan; Dubiley, Svetlana; Sutormin, Dmitry","Rusanova, Anastasiia (Institute of Gene Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, 119334 Moscow, Russia;, rusanova@genebiology.ru, (A.R.);, S.Dubiley@skoltech.ru, (S.D.)); Fedorchuk, Victor (The Faculty of Geology, Lomonosov Moscow State University, 119234 Moscow, Russia;, V.Fedorchuk@skoltech.ru); Toshchakov, Stepan (Kurchatov Center for Genome Research, National Research Center “Kurchatov Institute”, 123182 Moscow, Russia;, Toschakov_SV@nrcki.ru); Dubiley, Svetlana (Institute of Gene Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, 119334 Moscow, Russia;, rusanova@genebiology.ru, (A.R.);, S.Dubiley@skoltech.ru, (S.D.); Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, 121205 Moscow, Russia); Sutormin, Dmitry (Institute of Gene Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, 119334 Moscow, Russia;, rusanova@genebiology.ru, (A.R.);, S.Dubiley@skoltech.ru, (S.D.); Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, 121205 Moscow, Russia)","Sutormin, Dmitry (Institute of Gene Biology; ; Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology)","Rusanova, Anastasiia (Institute of Gene Biology); Fedorchuk, Victor (Lomonosov Moscow State University); Toshchakov, Stepan (Kurchatov Institute); Dubiley, Svetlana (Institute of Gene Biology; Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology); Sutormin, Dmitry (Institute of Gene Biology; Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology)",Kurchatov Institute; Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology; Institute of Gene Biology; Lomonosov Moscow State University,grid.18919.38; grid.454320.4; grid.419021.f; grid.14476.30,Moscow; Skolkovo; Moscow; Moscow,; ; ; ,Russia; Russia; Russia; Russia,,,,,,3,3,0.19,1.26,3,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/12/1/25/pdf?version=1640350256,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144181290,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3107 Microbiology,Infectious Diseases,Infection,2.2 Factors relating to the physical environment,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,

The aim of this study was to investigate how a natural and a species richness-reduced wood decaying community diversity were capable of decomposing Fagus sylvatica dead wood under a constant and a fluctuating temperature regime. Therefore, microcosms with both diversity levels (natural and species richness-reduced) were prepared and incubated for 8 weeks under both temperature regimes. Relative wood mass loss, wood pH, carbon dioxide, and methane emissions, as well as fungal and bacterial community compositions in terms of Simpson's diversity, richness and evenness were investigated. Community interaction patterns and co-occurrence networks were calculated. Community composition was affected by temperature regime and natural diversity caused significantly higher mass loss than richness-reduced diversity. In contrast, richness-reduced diversity increased wood pH. The bacterial community composition was less affected by richness reduction and temperature regimes than the fungal community composition. Microbial interaction patterns showed more mutual exclusions in richness-reduced compared to natural diversity as the reduction mainly reduced abundant fungal species and disintegrated previous interaction patterns. Microbial communities reassembled in richness-reduced diversity with a focus on nitrate reducing and dinitrogen-fixing bacteria as connectors in the network, indicating their high relevance to reestablish ecosystem functions. Therefore, a stochastic richness reduction was followed by functional trait based reassembly to recover previous ecosystem productivity.","We thank the managers of the three Exploratories, Miriam Teuscher, Juliane Vogt, Katrin Lorenzen, Kirsten Reichel-Jung and all former managers for their work in maintaining the plot and project infrastructure, Christiane Fischer for giving support through the central office, Michael Owonibi for managing the central data base, and Markus Fischer, Eduard Linsenmair, Dominik Hessenmöller, Daniel Prati, Ernst-Detlef Schulze, Wolfgang W.

In wastewater treatment systems, acylated homoserine lactone (AHL)-based QS has been correlated with the conversion of floccular biomass into microbial granules, as well as EPS production and the nitrogen removal process. However, the role of QS in such complex communities is still not fully understood, including the QS-proficient taxa and the functional QS genes involved. To address these questions, we performed a metagenomic screen for AHL genes in an activated sludge microbial community from the Ulu Pandan wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Singapore followed by functional validation of luxI activity using AHL biosensors and LC–MSMS profiling. We identified 13 luxI and 30 luxR homologs from the activated sludge metagenome. Of those genes, two represented a cognate pair of luxIR genes belonging to a Nitrospira spp. and those genes were demonstrated to be functionally active. The LuxI homolog synthesized AHLs that were consistent with the dominant AHLs in the activated sludge system. Furthermore, the LuxR homolog was shown to bind to and induce expression of the luxI promoter, suggesting this represents an autoinduction feedback system, characteristic of QS circuits. Additionally, a second, active promoter was upstream of a gene encoding a protein with a GGDEF/EAL domain, commonly associated with modulating the intracellular concentration of the secondary messenger, c-di-GMP. Thus, the metagenomic approach used here was demonstrated to effectively identify functional QS genes and suggests that Nitrospira spp. maybe QS is active in the activated sludge community.",The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from National Research Foundation and Ministry of Education Singapore under its Research Center of Excellence Program.,,npj Biofilms and Microbiomes,,Springer Nature,2055-5008,Acyl-Butyrolactones; Metagenome; Metagenomics; Quorum Sensing; Sewage,2021-10-28,2021,2021-10-28,,7,1,79,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tan, Chuan Hao; Yeo, Yee Phan; Hafiz, Muhammad; Ng, Noele Kai Jing; Subramoni, Sujatha; Taj, Shireen; Tay, Martin; Chao, Xie; Kjelleberg, Staffan; Rice, Scott A.","Tan, Chuan Hao (Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore; Kemin Industries (Asia) Pte.

Understanding microbial responses to gradients in environmental stressors, such as wastewater pollution, is crucial to identify thresholds of community change and to develop management strategies that protect ecosystem integrity. This study used multiple lines of empirical evidence, including a novel combination of microbial ecotoxicology methods in the laboratory and field to link pressure-stressor-response relationships. Specifically, community-based whole effluent toxicity (WET) testing and environmental genomics were integrated to determine real-world community interactions, shifts and functional change in response to wastewater pollution. Here we show that wastewater effluents above moderate (>10%) concentrations caused consistent significant shifts in bacterial community structure and function. These thresholds of community shifts were also linked to changes in the trophic state of receiving waters in terms of nutrient concentrations. Differences in the community responses along the effluent concentration gradient were primarily driven by two globally relevant bacterial indicator taxa, namely Malikia spp. (Burkholderiales) and hgcI_clade (Frankiales). Species replacement occurred above moderate effluent concentrations with abundances of Malikia spp. increasing, while abundances of hgcI_clade decreased. The responses of Malikia spp. and hgcI_clade matched gene patterns associated with globally important nitrogen cycling pathways, such as denitrification and nitrogen fixation, which linked the core individual taxa to putative function and ecosystem processes, rarely achieved in previous studies. This study has identified potential indicators of change in trophic status and the functional consequences of wastewater pollution. These findings have immediate implications for both the management of environmental stressors and protection of aquatic ecosystems.","This dataset was collected as part of a larger project on the Hunter River estuary funded by Hunter Water Corporation.

While individual microbial species have been found to be associated with certain disease states, increasing evidence suggests that higher-order microbial interactions may have an equal or greater contribution to host fitness. To better understand microbial community dynamics, we utilize networks to study interactions through a meta-analysis of microbial association networks between healthy and disease gut microbiomes. Taking advantage of the large number of metagenomes derived from healthy individuals and patients with various diseases, together with recent advances in network inference that can deal with sparse compositional data, we inferred microbial association networks based on co-occurrence of gut microbial species and made the networks publicly available as a resource (GitHub repository named GutNet). Through our meta-analysis of inferred networks, we were able to identify network-associated features that help stratify between healthy and disease states such as the differentiation of various bacterial phyla and enrichment of Proteobacteria interactions in diseased networks. Additionally, our findings show that the contributions of taxa in microbial associations are disproportionate to their abundances and that rarer taxa of microbial species play an integral part in shaping dynamics of microbial community interactions. Network-based meta-analysis revealed valuable insights into microbial community dynamics between healthy and disease phenotypes.

Here we show the relative significance of the ecological mechanisms selection, dispersal and drift for shaping the composition of microbial communities in the Pacific Ocean over a transect of 12,400 km between subantarctic and subarctic regions. In the epipelagic, homogeneous selection contributes 50–60% and drift least to the three mechanism for the assembly of prokaryotic communities whereas in the upper mesopelagic, drift is relatively most important for the particle-associated subcommunities. Temperature is important for the relative significance of homogeneous selection and dispersal limitation for community assembly. The relative significance of both mechanisms was inverted with increasing temperature difference along the transect. For eukaryotes >8 µm, homogeneous selection is also the most important mechanisms at two epipelagic depths whereas at all other depths drift is predominant. As species interactions are essential for structuring microbial communities we further analyzed co-occurrence-based community metrics to assess biogeographic patterns over the transect. These interaction-adjusted indices explained much better variations in microbial community composition as a function of abiotic and biotic variables than compositional or phylogenetic distance measures like Bray–Curtis or UniFrac. Our analyses are important to better understand assembly processes of microbial communities in the upper layers of the largest ocean and how they adapt to effectively perform in global biogeochemical processes. Similar principles presumably act upon microbial community assembly in other ocean basins.","We thank Captain L.

Evolutionary biologists typically consider the effects of chance mutation and historical contingency in driving divergence and convergence of traits in populations, whereas ecologists instead are often interested in the role of historical contingency in community assembly and succession. Although genetic differences among individuals in populations can influence community interactions, variability among populations of the same species has received relatively little attention for its potential role in community assembly and succession. We used a community-level study of experimental evolution in two compositionally different assemblages of protists and rotifers to explore whether initial differences in species abundances among communities attributed to differences in evolutionary history, persisted as species that continued to evolve over time. In each assemblage, we observed significant convergence between two invaded treatments initially differing in evolutionary history over an observation period equal to ~40-80 generations for most species. Nonetheless, community structure failed to converge completely across all invaded treatments within an assemblage to a single structure. This suggests that whereas the species in the assemblage represent a common selective regime, differences in populations reflecting their evolutionary history can produce long-lasting transient alternative community states. In one assemblage, we also observed increasing within-treatment variability among replicate communities over time, suggesting that ecological drift may be another factor contributing to community change. Although subtle, these transient alternative states, in which communities differed in the abundance of interacting species, could nonetheless have important functional consequences, suggesting that the role of evolution in driving these states deserves greater attention.",ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Rutgers University (Peter J.

Parasitic interactions are among the most common species interaction types, and analysis of parasite-host ranges can advance understanding of how host-parasite pairs structure community interactions across their geographic distributions. Using network analysis and host preference relative index, we analysed host use by the South American mistletoe, Tristerix corymbosus (Loranthaceae), in 22 localities among two biomes: Chilean matorral and temperate forest. The total number of host species recorded was 27, and 40% of these species were non-native. The non-native Populus sp. was shared between biomes. There was a positive relationship between host range and potential host species richness at the studied localities. On average, the mistletoe parasitized each host species relative to its abundance. However, some host species in some localities are more parasitized than expected. Network structure showed a differences in host use between the two biomes: Aristotelia chilensis was central in the temperate forest, with Populus sp. in the Chilean matorral. Host use intensity in the Chilean matorral was higher for non-native species. Tristerix corymbosus has a wide host range and could be considered a generalist parasite across its full geographic distribution, but at local scales, host preferences differed among localities and are related to host coverage. Alterations in community composition, due to natural events or human activities, can modify the availability of possible hosts. Hence, the mistletoe with the described characteristics may be able to change its infection preference while maintaining the interaction functionality.","We thank M. Rodriguez Cabal and L.

Network analysis allows for both community-level properties to be computed and investigated, and species-level roles to be determined. Here, using data from 31 host–parasite interaction networks from local fish communities around the world, we test for latitudinal trends at whole-network level, and taxonomic patterns at individual parasite species level. We found that while controlling for network size (number of species per network), network modularity, or the tendency for the network to be subdivided into groups of species that interact mostly with each other, decreased with increasing latitude. This suggests that tropical fish–parasite networks may be more stable than those from temperate regions in the event of community perturbations, such as species extinction. At the species level, after accounting for the effect of host specificity, we observed no difference in the centrality of parasite species within networks between parasites with different transmission modes. However, species in some taxa, namely branchiurans, acanthocephalans and larval trematodes, generally had higher centrality values than other parasite taxa. Because species with a central position often serve as module connectors, these 3 taxa may play a key role in whole-network cohesion. Our results highlight the usefulness of network analysis to reveal the aspects of fish–parasite community interactions that would otherwise remain hidden and advance our understanding of their evolution.","We thank Bahram Dezfuli and Tomáš Scholz, guest editors of this special thematic collection, for inviting us to contribute this article.

Autonomic alterations, including gastrointestinal symptoms, precede motor defects and act as early warning signs. Chronic exposure to dietary, environmental heavy metals impacts the gastrointestinal system and host-associated microbiome, eventually affecting the central nervous system. The correlation between dysbiosis and PD suggests a functional and bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain. The bioaccumulation of metals promotes stress mechanisms by increasing reactive oxygen species, likely altering the bidirectional gut-brain link. To better understand the differing molecular mechanisms underlying PD, integrative modeling approaches are necessary to connect multifactorial perturbations in this heterogeneous disorder. By exploring the effects of gut microbiota modulation on dietary heavy metal exposure in relation to PD onset, the modification of the host-associated microbiome to mitigate neurological stress may be a future treatment option against neurodegeneration through bioremediation. The progressive movement towards a systems toxicology framework for precision medicine can uncover molecular mechanisms underlying PD onset such as metal regulation and microbial community interactions by developing predictive models to better understand PD etiology to identify options for novel treatments and beyond. Several methodologies recently addressed the complexity of this interaction from different perspectives; however, to date, a comprehensive review of these approaches is still lacking. Therefore, our main aim through this manuscript is to fill this gap in the scientific literature by reviewing recently published papers to address the surrounding questions regarding the underlying molecular mechanisms between metals, microbiota, and the gut-brain-axis, as well as the regulation of this system to prevent neurodegeneration.",The authors are grateful for institutional support during the preparation of this manuscript.

To decipher the physicochemical and microbial mechanisms, we adopted C-isotopic analysis, high-throughput sequencing and multivariate statistical analyses such as random forest (RF) and structure equation modeling (SEM). Negative and neutral PEs were observed up to -48.5% of relative PEs during 28 days of incubation. All the acidic soils exhibited negative PEs, so as the neutral Alfisol and alkaline Aridisol, which had a suppression effect on SOC mineralization accounted for -29.4 and -32.0% of relative PEs. Among all abiotic factors, soil silt-clay fraction and the initial pH values play the most important roles in PEs determination through directly inhibiting PEs by protection SOC and indirectly shaping bacterial communities respectively. On the whole community level, biochar treatments defined much less microbiome (0.6% and 1.2% for variance of bacterial and fungal community) than soil types (93.5% and 83.3% respectively) across soils. Thus, the initial community (i.e., bacteria alpha-diversity and copiotrophic bacteria as revealed by SEM) of different soils might be more critical for PE prediction. Furthermore, co-occurrence network analysis indicated out-competition of fungi by bacteria with increase of mutual exclusion and decrease of fungal occupancy. This could exacerbate negative PEs in soils with lower bacterial alpha-diversity and dominance by copiotrophys due to less functional complementary for recalcitrant SOC decomposition.",This study was supported by the National Science Foundation of China (41671233) and the Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province (D2019111043).,,The Science of The Total Environment,,Elsevier,"0048-9697, 1879-1026",Carbon; Charcoal; Soil; Soil Microbiology,2020-07-22,2020,2020-07-22,2020-12,746,,141057,Closed,Article,"Yu, Zhuyun; Ling, Lu; Singh, Bhupinder Pal; Luo, Yu; Xu, Jianming","Yu, Zhuyun (Institute of Soil and Water Resources and Environmental Science, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Agricultural Resources and Environment, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China; Hebei Key Laboratory of Wetland Ecology and Conservation, Hengshui University, Hengshui 053000, China.); Ling, Lu (Institute of Soil and Water Resources and Environmental Science, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Agricultural Resources and Environment, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.); Singh, Bhupinder Pal (Department of Primary Industries, Elizabeth Macarthur Agricultural Institute, Menangle, NSW 2568, Australia.); Luo, Yu (Institute of Soil and Water Resources and Environmental Science, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Agricultural Resources and Environment, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.

It enables the transformation of OMICs datasets into biological knowledge. It consists of reverse engineering gene regulatory networks from OMICs data, such as RNAseq or mass spectrometry-based proteomics data, through computational methods. This approach allows to identify signalling pathways involved in specific biological functions. The ability to infer causality in gene regulatory networks, in addition to correlation, is crucial for several modelling approaches and allows targeted control in biotechnology applications.MethodsWe performed simulations according to the approximate Bayesian computation method, where the core model consisted of a steady-state simulation algorithm used to study gene regulatory networks in systems for which a limited level of details is available. The simulations outcome was compared to experimentally measured transcriptomics and proteomics data through approximate Bayesian computation.ResultsThe structure of small gene regulatory networks responsible for the regulation of biological functions involved in biomining were inferred from multi OMICs data of mixed bacterial cultures. Several causal inter- and intraspecies interactions were inferred between genes coding for proteins involved in the biomining process, such as heavy metal transport, DNA damage, replication and repair, and membrane biogenesis. The method also provided indications for the role of several uncharacterized proteins by the inferred connection in their network context.ConclusionsThe combination of fast algorithms with high-performance computing allowed the simulation of a multitude of gene regulatory networks and their comparison to experimentally measured OMICs data through approximate Bayesian computation, enabling the probabilistic inference of causality in gene regulatory networks of a multispecies bacterial system involved in biomining without need of single-cell or multiple perturbation experiments.

Predation plays an integral role in many community interactions, with the number of predators and the rate at which they consume prey (i.e. their functional response) determining interaction strengths. Owing to the difficulty of directly observing predation events, attempts to determine the functional response of predators in natural systems are limited. Determining the forms that predator functional responses take in complex systems is important in advancing understanding of community interactions. 2. Prey survival has a direct relationship to the functional response of their predators. We employed this relationship to estimate the functional response for bald eagle Haliaeetus leucocepalus predation of Canada goose Branta canadensis nests. We compared models that incorporated eagle abundance, nest abundance and alternative prey presence to determine the form of the functional response that best predicted intra-annual variation in survival of goose nests. 3. Eagle abundance, nest abundance and the availability of alternative prey were all related to predation rates of goose nests by eagles. There was a sigmoidal relationship between predation rate and prey abundance and prey switching occurred when alternative prey was present. In addition, predation by individual eagles increased as eagle abundance increased. 4. A complex set of interactions among the three species examined in this study determined survival rates of goose nests. Results show that eagle predation had both prey- and predator-dependent components with no support for ratio dependence. In addition, indirect interactions resulting from the availability of alternative prey had an important role in mediating the rate at which eagles depredated nests. As a result, much of the within-season variation in nest survival was due to changing availability of alternative prey consumed by eagles. 5. Empirical relationships drawn from ecological theory can be directly integrated into the estimation process to determine the mechanisms responsible for variation in observed survival rates. The relationship between predator functional response and prey survival offers a flexible and robust method to advance our understanding of predator-prey interactions in many complex natural systems where prey populations are marked and regularly visited.","The U.S. Geological Survey (Alaska Science Center), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Region 7, Migratory Bird Management) and the U.S. Forest Service (Chugach National Forest, Cordova Ranger District) provided funding for this project.

In this review, based on novel insights into long-distance (i.e., leaf-leaf, root-shoot) defence signalling, we explore the role of phytohormones in driving broad-scale patterns of aboveground-belowground interactions that can be extrapolated to general plant-insect relationships. We propose that the outcome of intra-feeding guild interactions is generally negative due to induction of similar phytohormonal pathways, whereas between-guild interactions are often positive due to negative signal crosstalk.

In particular, this is true of the field of phylogeography, a discipline that attempts to describe geographical variation in species using neutral genetic diversity as a correlate of time. Through comparisons of information from multiple species, as well as background information about the abiotic environment and how it has changed over time, we should be able to reassemble many of the forces that were important in assembling the communities and community interactions found in a given region. Here I review the information available for coastal species in the northwestern Atlantic, and argue that an integration of ecological, genetic, geological and oceanographic information can illustrate emergent patterns of community genetics.","Many thanks to C.

The goal of clean water for everyone has to be achieved with a still growing human population and their rapid concentration in large cities, often megacities. How long introduced pathogens survive in rivers and what their niches are remain poorly known but essential to control water-borne diseases in megacities. Biofilms are often niches for various pathogens because they possess high resistances against environmental stress. They also facilitate gene transfers of antibiotic resistance genes which become an increasing health problem. Beside biofilms, amoebae are carriers of pathogenic bacteria and niches for their survival.

A particular interaction network structure, compartments, divided subsystems with minimal linkage to other subsystems, has been emphasized as a key stabilizer of community dynamics. This concept inherently includes spatiality because communities are physically separated. Nevertheless, few theoretical studies have explicitly focused on such spatial compartmentation. Here using a meta-community model of a food web, I show that compartments have less effect on community stability than previously thought. Instead, less compartmentation of a food web can greatly increase stability, particularly when subsystems are moderately coupled by species migration. Furthermore, compartmentation has a strong destabilization effect in larger systems. The results of the present study suggest that spatial limitation of species interactions rather than of community interactions plays a key role in ecosystem maintenance.",This study was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) (#16K18621) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.

In the most highly studied canopy-forming kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera (the giant kelp), models of hydrodynamic and oceanographic phenomena influencing spore movement provide bounds on reproduction, quantify patterns of local and regional propagule supply, identify scales of population connectivity, and establish context for agents of early life mortality. Other analyses yield insight into flow-mediated species interactions within kelp forests. In each case, advances emerge from the use of ecomechanical approaches that propagate physical-biological connections at the scale of the individual to higher levels of ecological organization. In systems where physical factors strongly influence population, community or ecosystem properties, such mechanics-based methods promote crucial progress but are just beginning to realize their full potential.","Footnotes We thank M.

In this paper, we examine a host-parasite model with an additional predator and show that the predator changes the evolutionary behaviour of the host. We find that the hosts maximize their levels of resistance at intermediate predation rates, where the cost of infection and the risk of exposure to disease are both high. We show that this effect is heightened when parasites are highly virulent and when there is strong selective predation. We also show that the potential for evolutionary branching increases with the predation rate for regions where the susceptible and infected hosts coexist with the predator. Hence, our results reveal that there are considerable impacts of adding predators to a population.",We thank Andy Hoyle and Mike Boots for interesting discussions about this work.

Here, we experimentally tested how antagonistic and facilitative pairwise interactions within resident model microbial communities predict invasion by the plant-pathogenic bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum. We found that facilitative resident community interactions promoted and antagonistic interactions suppressed invasions both in the lab and in the tomato plant rhizosphere. Crucially, pairwise interactions reliably explained observed invasion outcomes also in multispecies communities, and mechanistically, this was linked to direct inhibition of the invader by antagonistic communities (antibiosis), and to a lesser degree by resource competition between members of the resident community and the invader. Together, our findings suggest that the type and strength of pairwise interactions can reliably predict the outcome of invasions in more complex multispecies communities.","This research was financially supported by the National Key Basic Research Program of China (2015CB150503, Qirong Shen), National Natural Science Foundation of China (41471213 to Yangchun Xu; 41671248 to Zhong Wei), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK20170085, Zhong Wei), the 111 project (B12009, Qirong Shen), Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program by CAST (2015QNRC001 to Zhong Wei) and the Qing Lan Project (funding to Yangchun Xu and Zhong Wei).

Multi-omics and modern bioinformatics have provided the tools to assay molecules across different cellular and community scales; however, mechanistic knowledge over microbial interactions often remains elusive. This is due to the immense diversity and the essentially undiminished volume of not-yet-cultured microbes. Simplified model communities hold some promise in enabling researchers to manage complexity so that they can mechanistically understand the emergent properties of microbial community interactions. In this review, we surveyed several approaches that have effectively used tractable model consortia to elucidate the complex behavior of microbial communities.

Here, we compared the prediction performance of a wide array of stochastic, population dynamics models against direct observations of the extinction process from an extensive experimental data set. By varying a series of biological and statistical assumptions in the proposed models, we were able to identify the assumptions that affected predictions about population extinction. We also show how certain autocorrelation structures can emerge due to interspecific interactions, and that accounting for the stochastic effect of these interactions can improve predictions of the extinction process.

In oligotrophic polar deserts, the effects of katabatic winds, constrained nutrients, and low water availability are known to limit microbial activity. Although phages may substantially govern trophic interactions in cold deserts, relatively little is known regarding the precise ecological mechanisms. Here, we provide the first evidence of widespread antiphage innate immunity in Antarctic environments using metagenomic sequence data from hypolith communities as model systems. In particular, immunity systems such as DISARM and BREX are shown to be dominant systems in these communities. Additionally, we show a direct correlation between the CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity and the metavirome of hypolith communities, suggesting the existence of dynamic host-phage interactions. In addition to providing the first exploration of immune systems in cold deserts, our results suggest that phages actively challenge niche communities in Antarctic polar deserts. We provide evidence suggesting that the regulatory role played by phages in this system is an important determinant of bacterial host interactions in this environment.IMPORTANCE In Antarctic environments, the combination of both abiotic and biotic stressors results in simple trophic levels dominated by microbiomes. Although the past two decades have revealed substantial insights regarding the diversity and structure of microbiomes, we lack mechanistic insights regarding community interactions and how phages may affect these. By providing the first evidence of widespread antiphage innate immunity, we shed light on phage-host dynamics in Antarctic niche communities. Our analyses reveal several antiphage defense systems, including DISARM and BREX, which appear to dominate in cold desert niche communities. In contrast, our analyses revealed that genes which encode antiphage adaptive immunity were underrepresented in these communities, suggesting lower infection frequencies in cold edaphic environments.

Here, we present a computational analysis approach called CAMP (Co-culture/Community Analyses for Metabolite Production) that simulates and identifies appropriate communities to produce a metabolite of interest. To demonstrate this approach, we focus on the optimal production of lactate from various Lactic Acid Bacteria. We used genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs) belonging to Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, and Pediococcus species from the Virtual Metabolic Human (VMH; https://vmh.life/) resource and well-curated GSMMs of L. plantarum WCSF1 and L. reuteri JCM 1112. We analysed 1176 two-species communities using a constraint-based modelling method for steady-state flux-balance analysis of communities. Flux variability analysis was used to detect the maximum lactate flux in the communities. Using glucose or xylose as substrates separately or in combination resulted in either parasitism, amensalism, or mutualism being the dominant interaction behaviour in the communities. Interaction behaviour between members of the community was deduced based on variations in the predicted growth rates of monocultures and co-cultures. Acetaldehyde, ethanol, acetate, among other metabolites, were found to be cross-fed between community members. L. plantarum WCSF1 was found to be a member of communities with high lactate yields. In silico community optimisation strategies to predict reaction knock-outs for improving lactate flux were implemented. Reaction knock-outs of acetate kinase, phosphate acetyltransferase, and fumarate reductase in the communities were found to enhance lactate production.",M.I. acknowledges the IIT Madras Institute Post-Doctoral Fellowship and support from Centre for Integrative Biology and Systems mEdicine (IBSE).,,Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal,,Elsevier,2001-0370,,2021-11-09,2021,2021-11-09,2021,19,,6039-6049,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ibrahim, Maziya; Raman, Karthik","Ibrahim, Maziya (Department of Biotechnology, Bhupat and Jyoti Mehta School of Biosciences, IIT Madras, India; Centre for Integrative Biology and Systems mEdicine (IBSE), IIT Madras, India; Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (RBC-DSAI), IIT Madras, India); Raman, Karthik (Department of Biotechnology, Bhupat and Jyoti Mehta School of Biosciences, IIT Madras, India; Centre for Integrative Biology and Systems mEdicine (IBSE), IIT Madras, India; Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (RBC-DSAI), IIT Madras, India)","Raman, Karthik (Indian Institute of Technology Madras; Indian Institute of Technology Madras; Indian Institute of Technology Madras)","Ibrahim, Maziya (Indian Institute of Technology Madras; Indian Institute of Technology Madras; Indian Institute of Technology Madras); Raman, Karthik (Indian Institute of Technology Madras; Indian Institute of Technology Madras; Indian Institute of Technology Madras)",Indian Institute of Technology Madras,grid.417969.4,Chennai,Tamil Nadu,India,Indian Institute of Technology Madras,,India,,,5,5,0.87,1.57,8,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2021.11.009,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142439377,31 Biological Sciences; 3106 Industrial Biotechnology,,,,,,B12 Engineering,

One approach to overcoming this challenge is to use animal models of host-microbiome interaction, but it must be determined that relevant aspects of host-microbiome interactions are reflected in the animal model. One such experimental validation is an experiment by Ridura et al. In that experiment, transplanting a microbiome from a human into a mouse also conferred the human donor's obesity phenotype. We have aggregated a collection of previously published host-microbiome mouse-model experiments and combined it with thousands of sequenced and annotated bacterial genomes and metametabolomic pathways. Three computational models were generated, each model reflecting an aspect of host-microbiome interactions: 1) Predict the change in microbiome community structure in response to host diet using a community interaction network, 2) Predict metagenomic data from microbiome community structure, and 3) Predict host obesogenesis from modeled microbiome metagenomic data. These computationally validated models were combined into an integrated model of host-microbiome-diet interactions and used to replicate the Ridura experiment in silico. The results of the computational models indicate that network-based models are significantly more predictive than similar but non-network-based models. Network-based models also provide additional insight into the molecular mechanisms of host-microbiome interaction by highlighting metabolites and metabolic pathways proposed to be associated with microbiome-based obesogenesis. While the models generated in this study are likely too specific to the animal models and experimental conditions used to train our models to be of general utility in a broader understanding of obesogenesis, the approach detailed here is expected to be a powerful tool of investigating multiple types of host-microbiome interactions.",We would like to acknowledge Dr. Philippe Noirot and Danielle M.

However, little is known on how such disturbance impacts species interactions in biological communities. This study aims to elucidate the variation of species interactions across multiple trophic levels and further determine crucial factor(s) in regulating observed variation. We collected plankton samples from Sanjiang Wetlands in Northeastern China and used random matrix theory (MRT)-based approach to construct species interaction networks for bacterioplanktons, protozoans, and metazoans, respectively. We found that biotic interactions were more complex at lower trophic levels. Network key species (e.g., module hubs and connectors) were detected only in the bacterioplankton network. More inter- and intra-module connections, particularly negative connections, were detected in the bacterioplankton network. Across all three trophic levels, the element sodium (Na) was the most important factor influencing the network structure, while at each trophic level, physicochemical factors, nutrients, and organic pollutants were identified as crucial determinants but their relative importance differed. In particular, no correlation was detected between the metazoan network and any environmental factor. After separating protozoan and metazoan communities into subgroups in relatively poor and good water environments, we found community interaction networks were more complex in good conditions than in poor conditions. A simple network structure (e.g., no inter-module connectors or intra-module hubs, and less competitive links) and less association with environmental factors in the higher trophic levels clearly illustrate that metazoan and protozoan communities in the fragmented wetlands are unstable and vulnerable. Therefore, further environmental changes may greatly influence species interactions in these communities. Collectively, our findings provide new insights into dynamics of influence of environmental changes on biotic interactions in aquatic biological communities, highlighting the necessity to use a multi-trophic strategy when assessing negative effects of environmental changes in aquatic ecosystems.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Intriguingly, these interactions can in some cases cause synergies, where the community is able to outperform its single-species constituents. However, the underlying mechanisms driving community interactions are often unknown and difficult to identify due to high community complexity. Here, we show how opposite pH drift induced by specific community members leads to pH stabilization of the microenvironment, acting as a positive interspecies interaction, driving in vitro community synergy in a model consortium of four coisolated soil bacteria, Microbacterium oxydans, Xanthomonas retroflexus, Stenotrophomonas rhizophila, and Paenibacillus amylolyticus We use microsensor pH measurements to show how individual species change the local pH microenvironment and how cocultivation leads to a stabilized pH regime over time. Specifically, in vitro acid production from P. amylolyticus and alkali production primarily from X. retroflexus led to an overall pH stabilization of the local environment over time, which in turn resulted in enhanced community growth. This specific type of interspecies interaction was found to be highly dependent on medium type and concentration; however, similar pH drift from the individual species could be observed across medium variants.IMPORTANCE Understanding interspecies interactions in bacterial communities is important for unraveling species dynamics in naturally occurring communities. These dynamics are fundamental for identifying evolutionary drivers and for the development of efficient biotechnological industry applications. Recently, pH interplay among community members has been identified as a factor affecting community development, and pH stabilization has been demonstrated to result in enhanced community growth. The use of model communities in which the effect of changing pH level can be attributed to specific species contributes to the investigation of community developmental drivers. This contributes to assessment of the extent of emergent behavior and members' contributions to community development. Here, we show that pH stabilization of the microenvironment in vitro in a synthetic coisolated model community results in synergistic growth. This observation adds to the growing diversity of community interactions leading to enhanced community growth and hints toward pH as a strong driver for community development in diverse environments.","We thank Annette Løth for assistance with medium preparation, Maja Holm Wahlgren and Anders Primé for their assistance with nitrous oxide measurements, and Peter Østrup Jensen for assistance with microsensor equipment.

These changes in preferences affect coexistence within pollinator guilds as well as within plant guilds. Using a mathematical model, we study how adaptations of pollinator preferences influence population dynamics of a two-plant-two-pollinator community interaction module. Adaptation leads to coexistence between generalist and specialist pollinators, and produces complex plant population dynamics, involving alternative stable states and discrete transitions in the plant community. Pollinator adaptation also leads to plant-plant apparent facilitation that is mediated by changes in pollinator preferences. We show that adaptive pollinator behavior reduces niche overlap and leads to coexistence by specialization on different plants. Thus, this article documents how adaptive pollinator preferences for plants change the structure and coexistence of plant-pollinator communities.",We thank Francisco Encinas–Viso and two anonymous reviewers for comments and suggestions.

Understanding the processes that regulate soil respiration is critical for predicting future climate. Recent work has suggested that soil carbon respiration may be reduced by competition for nitrogen between symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungi that associate with plant roots and free-living microbial decomposers, which is consistent with increased soil carbon storage in ectomycorrhizal ecosystems globally. However, experimental tests of the mycorrhizal competition hypothesis are lacking. Here we show that ectomycorrhizal roots and hyphae decrease soil carbon respiration rates by up to 67% under field conditions in two separate field exclusion experiments, and this likely occurs via competition for soil nitrogen, an effect larger than 2 °C soil warming. These findings support mycorrhizal competition for nitrogen as an independent driver of soil carbon balance and demonstrate the need to understand microbial community interactions to predict ecosystem feedbacks to global climate.","CA was supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (DGE‐1110007) and Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant (DEB‐1401299).

The strength of these top-down pressures is variable, however, and may be influenced by both ecological and evolutionary processes. We conducted a chemostat experiment to assess the direct and indirect effects of viruses on a marine microbial food web comprised of an autotrophic host (Synechococcus) and non-target heterotrophic bacteria. Viruses dramatically altered the host population dynamics, which in turn influenced phosphorus resource availability and the stoichiometric allocation of nutrients into microbial biomass. These virus effects diminished with time, but could not be attributed to changes in the abundance or composition of heterotrophic bacteria. Instead, attenuation of the virus effects coincided with the detection of resistant host phenotypes, suggesting that rapid evolution buffered the effect of viruses on nutrient cycling. Our results demonstrate that evolutionary processes are important for community dynamics and ecosystem processes on ecologically relevant time scales.","We acknowledge F. Lemieux and M.

Community interactions and dynamics among microorganisms, as well as their significance during the manufacturing processes, are central issues in modern food microbiology. Recent studies demonstrated that the emergence of a yeast prion termed [GAR+] in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is induced by coculturing with bacterial cells, resulting in the switching of the carbon metabolism. In order to facilitate mutualistic symbiosis among microorganisms, this mode of microbial interaction is induced between yeasts and lactic acid bacteria species used in traditional sake making. Thus, yeast prions have attracted much attention as novel platforms that govern the metabolic adaptation of cross-kingdom ecosystems. Our minireview focuses on the plausible linkage between fermented-food microbial communication and yeast prion-mediated metabolic reprogramming.","We are grateful to K. Sunada, T. Takahashi and T.

Conifers normally dominate the tree layer across the biome, but other aspects of ecosystem structure and dynamics vary geographically. The cause of the conspicuous differences in the understory vegetation and the herbivore-predator cycles between northwestern Europe and western North America presents an enigma. Ericaceous dwarf shrubs and 3- to 4-year vole-mustelid cycles characterize the European boreal forests, whereas tall deciduous shrubs and 10-year snowshoe hare-lynx cycles characterize the North American ones. We discuss plausible explanations for this difference and conclude that it is bottom-up: Winter climate is the key determinant of the dominant understory vegetation that then determines the herbivore-predator food-web interactions. The crucial unknown for the twenty-first century is how climate change and increasing instability will affect these forests, both with respect to the dynamics of individual plant and animal species and to their community interactions.",This article is part of the BEcoDyn project funded by Hedmark University College and a grant from the Norwegian Research Council (NFR project no. 221056) to HPA.

However, given that most microorganisms exist as multispecies consortia, the field is increasingly exploring microbial communities using a range of technologies traditionally limited to populations, including meta-omics based approaches and high resolution imaging. The experimental communities currently being explored range from relatively low diversity, for example, two to four species, to significantly more complex systems, comprised of several hundred species. Results from both defined and undefined communities have revealed a number of emergent properties, including improved stress tolerance, increased biomass production, community level signalling and metabolic cooperation. Based on results published to date, we submit that community-based studies are timely and increasingly reveal new properties associated with multispecies consortia that could not be predicted by studies of the individual component species. Here, we review a range of defined and undefined experimental systems used to study microbial community interactions.","Acknowledgements The authors would like to that Dr Sharon Longford for helpful comments and discussion of this work.

Here we demonstrate that 5-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methyl-1,3-thiazole-2-carboxylic acid (cHET) is a useful in vivo B1 precursor for representatives of ubiquitous marine picoeukaryotic phytoplankton and Escherichia coli – drawing attention to cHET as a valuable exogenous micronutrient for microorganisms with ecological, industrial, and biomedical value. Comparative utilization experiments with the terrestrial plant Arabidopsis thaliana revealed that it can also use exogenous cHET, but notably, picoeukaryotic marine phytoplankton and E. coli were adapted to grow on low (picomolar) concentrations of exogenous cHET. Our results call for the modification of the conventional B1 biosynthesis model to incorporate cHET as a key precursor for B1 biosynthesis in two domains of life, and for consideration of cHET as a microbial micronutrient currency modulating marine primary productivity and community interactions in human gut-hosted microbiomes.","Thanks are extended to S.

Leading efforts in this emergent field have demonstrated far-reaching impacts of lanthanide metabolism in biology; from the identification of novel roles of enzymes and pathways dependent on lanthanide-chemistry to the control of transcriptional regulatory networks to the modification of microbial community interactions. Even further, the recent discovery of lanthanide-dependent enzymes associated with multi-carbon metabolism in both methylotrophs and non-methylotrophs alike suggests that lanthanide biochemistry may be more widespread than initially thought. Current efforts aim to understand how lanthanide chemistry and lanthanide-dependent enzymes affect numerous ecosystems and metabolic functions.

However, little is known about the functional role heterotrophic bacteria play in anammox granules. Here, we use genome-centric metagenomics to recover 17 draft genomes of anammox and heterotrophic bacteria from a laboratory-scale anammox bioreactor. We combine metabolic network reconstruction with metatranscriptomics to examine the gene expression of anammox and heterotrophic bacteria and to identify their potential interactions. We find that Chlorobi-affiliated bacteria may be highly active protein degraders, catabolizing extracellular peptides while recycling nitrate to nitrite. Other heterotrophs may also contribute to scavenging of detritus and peptides produced by anammox bacteria, and potentially use alternative electron donors, such as H2, acetate and formate. Our findings improve the understanding of metabolic activities and interactions between anammox and heterotrophic bacteria and offer the first transcriptional insights on ecosystem function in anammox granules.","This work was supported by funding from the Central Valley Water Reclamation Facility (CVWRF) and the North Davis Sewer District awarded to R.G. and S.W.; Partial support was also provided by funding from the National Science Foundation (CBET-1435661 and MCB-1518130) awarded to D.R.N. and K.D.M., and a Postgraduate Scholarship-Doctoral (PGS-D) awarded by the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) to C.E.L.; The authors acknowledge Masaru K.

Here we explore how insect endosymbionts might affect the structure and dynamics of insect communities. Using the obligate and facultative symbionts of aphids as an example, we find that there are multiple ways that symbiont presence might affect food web structure. Many symbionts are now known to help their hosts escape or resist natural enemy attack, and others can allow their hosts to withstand abiotic stress or affect host plant use. In addition to the direct effect of symbionts on aphid phenotypes there may be indirect effects mediated through trophic and non-trophic community interactions. We believe that by using data from barcoding studies to identify bacterial symbionts, this extra, microbial dimension to insect food webs can be better elucidated.This article is part of the themed issue 'From DNA barcodes to biomes'.",,,Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B Biological Sciences,,The Royal Society,"0962-8436, 1471-2970",Animals; Aphids; Bacteria; Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; Food Chain; Symbiosis,2016-09-05,2016,2016-09-05,2016-09-05,371,1702,20150325,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"McLean, Ailsa H.

As a result, a significant portion of road runoff into surrounding aquatic habitats contains road deicing salts. Previous studies found road salt contaminations in vernal pools that pond-breeding amphibians commonly use, including spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) and wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus). Studies have examined the impact of road salt on both amphibian species, but to our knowledge no previous studies have examined how road salt impacts the interspecific competition between both amphibians. We hypothesized that road salt would negatively impact growth and survivorship of both amphibian species. During the spring and summer of 2017, we conducted an outdoor mesocosm experiment in which we created eight experimental conditions with three main factors: presence/absence of NaCl (1000 mg/L Cl-), presence/absence of interspecific competition between the two amphibian species (A. maculatum and L. sylvaticus), and presence/absence of predatory dragonfly larvae (Family Libellulidae). Our experiment revealed that salt delayed hatching and increased deformity in spotted salamander hatchlings. Additionally, salt reduced salamander survivorship by 62% and frog survivorship by 30%. Wood frog tadpoles and road salt interacted to diminish salamander survivorship a further 80% beyond salt alone, likely through an increase in interspecific competition. Road salt increased the larval period of salamanders and decreased the proportion metamorphosed by the end of the experiment. Dragonfly larvae reduced salamander survivorship by 35%, whereas they increased wood frog tadpole development rates. Dragonfly larvae and salt interacted to alter tadpole denticle size, with salt negating the impact of dragonfly larvae. Thus, we found that salt interfered with aquatic predatory chemical cues. Overall, the results of this study suggest that management strategies should be implemented in order to reduce the impact of road salts on freshwater aquatic ecosystems.","We thank Lindsey Trusal, Jahi Omari, Emma Hundermark, and all other members of the Takahashi lab for their assistance with this experiment.

An attempt was made to explore microbial community interactions in response to carbon, nitrogen and metal pollution. Additionally, experiments were designed to analyze the influence of these factors on horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Shift in bacterial diversity dynamics by arsenic stress and nutrient addition in coastal waters was explored by metagenomics of microcosm setups. Phylogenetic analysis revealed equal distribution of Gammaproteobacteria (29%) and Betaproteobacteria (28%) in control microcosm. This proportional diversity from control switched to unique distribution of Gammaproteobacteria (44.5%)> Flavobacteria (17.7%)> Bacteriodia (11.92%)> Betaproteobacteria (11.52%) in microcosm supplemented with carbon, nitrogen and metal (C + N + M). Among metal-stressed systems, alpha diversity analysis indicated highest diversity of genera in C + N + M followed by N + M > C+M> metal alone. Arsenic and ampicillin sensitive E. coli XL1 blue and environmental strains (Vibrio tubiashii W85 and E. coli W101) were tested for efficiency of uptake of plasmid (P) pUCminusMCS (arsBRampR) under varying stress conditions. Transformation experiments revealed that combined effect of carbon, nitrogen and metal on horizontal gene transfer (HGT) was significantly higher (p < 0.01) than individual factors. The effect of carbon on HGT was proved to be superior to nitrogen under metal stressed conditions. Presence of arsenic in experimental setups (P + M, P + N + M and P + C + M) enhanced the HGT compared to non-metal counterparts supplemented with carbon or nitrogen. Arsenic resistant bacterial isolates (n = 200) were tested for the ability to utilize various carbon and nitrogen substrates and distinct positive correlation (p < 0.001) was found between arsenic resistance and utilization of urea and nitrate. However, evident positive correlation was not found between carbon sources and arsenic resistance. Our findings suggest that carbon and nitrogen pollution in aquatic habitats under arsenic stress determine the microbial community dynamics and critically influence uptake of genetic material from the surrounding environment.","This study was undertaken as part of the in-house research on “Assessment of Cumulative Coastal Environmental Impacts [ACCES]” (# IR 12003) of NCSCM.

Resistant cultivars have the most effective strategy in controlling the Chinese wheat yellow mosaic disease, but the roles of the root and rhizosphere microbial interactions among different taxonomic levels of resistant cultivars are still unknown. Thus, we aimed to investigate whether these microbial community composition and network characteristics are related to disease resistance and to analyze the belowground plant-associated microflora. Relatively high microbial diversity and stable community structure for the resistant cultivars were detected. Comparison analysis showed that some bacterial phyla were significantly enriched in the wheat root or rhizosphere of the resistant wheat cultivar. Furthermore, the root and rhizosphere of the resistant cultivars greatly recruited many known beneficial bacterial and fungal taxa. In contrast, the relative abundance of potential pathogens was higher for the susceptible cultivar than for the resistant cultivar. Network co-occurrence analysis revealed that a much more complex, more mutually beneficial, and a higher number of bacterial keystone taxa in belowground microbial networks were displayed in the resistant cultivar, which may have been responsible for maintaining the stability and ecological balance of the microbial community. Overall, compared with the susceptible cultivar, the resistant cultivar tends to recruit more potential beneficial microbial groups for plant and rhizosphere microbial community interactions. These findings indicate that beneficial rhizosphere microbiomes for cultivars should be targeted and evaluated using community compositional profiles.Key points• Different resistance levels in cultivars affect the rhizosphere microbiome..• Resistant cultivars tend to recruit more potential beneficial microbial groups.• Bacteria occupy a high proportion and core position in the microflora network.",,,Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology,,Springer Nature,"0175-7598, 1432-0614",China; Mosaic Viruses; Plant Roots; Rhizosphere; Soil Microbiology; Triticum,2021-11-12,2021,2021-11-12,2021-12,105,24,9371-9383,Closed,Article,"Wu, Chuanfa; Wang, Fangyan; Zhang, Haoqing; Chen, Guixian; Deng, Yangwu; Chen, Jianping; Yang, Jian; Ge, Tida","Wu, Chuanfa (State Key Laboratory for Managing Biotic and Chemical Threats To the Quality and Safety of Agro-Products, Institute of Plant Virology, Ningbo University, 315211, Ningbo, China); Wang, Fangyan (State Key Laboratory for Managing Biotic and Chemical Threats To the Quality and Safety of Agro-Products, Institute of Plant Virology, Ningbo University, 315211, Ningbo, China); Zhang, Haoqing (State Key Laboratory for Managing Biotic and Chemical Threats To the Quality and Safety of Agro-Products, Institute of Plant Virology, Ningbo University, 315211, Ningbo, China); Chen, Guixian (State Key Laboratory for Managing Biotic and Chemical Threats To the Quality and Safety of Agro-Products, Institute of Plant Virology, Ningbo University, 315211, Ningbo, China; School of Resources and Environmental Engineering, Jiangxi University of Science and Technology, 341000, Ganzhou, China); Deng, Yangwu (School of Resources and Environmental Engineering, Jiangxi University of Science and Technology, 341000, Ganzhou, China); Chen, Jianping (State Key Laboratory for Managing Biotic and Chemical Threats To the Quality and Safety of Agro-Products, Institute of Plant Virology, Ningbo University, 315211, Ningbo, China); Yang, Jian (State Key Laboratory for Managing Biotic and Chemical Threats To the Quality and Safety of Agro-Products, Institute of Plant Virology, Ningbo University, 315211, Ningbo, China); Ge, Tida (State Key Laboratory for Managing Biotic and Chemical Threats To the Quality and Safety of Agro-Products, Institute of Plant Virology, Ningbo University, 315211, Ningbo, China)","Chen, Jianping (Ningbo University); Yang, Jian (Ningbo University); Ge, Tida (Ningbo University)","Wu, Chuanfa (Ningbo University); Wang, Fangyan (Ningbo University); Zhang, Haoqing (Ningbo University); Chen, Guixian (Ningbo University; Jiangxi University of Science and Technology); Deng, Yangwu (Jiangxi University of Science and Technology); Chen, Jianping (Ningbo University); Yang, Jian (Ningbo University); Ge, Tida (Ningbo University)",Jiangxi University of Science and Technology; Ningbo University,grid.440790.e; grid.203507.3,Ganzhou; Ningbo,; ,China; China,,,,,,13,13,1.49,6.18,8,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142551070,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3004 Crop and Pasture Production; 3008 Horticultural Production; 31 Biological Sciences; 3107 Microbiology; 3108 Plant Biology",,,,,,"A06 Agriculture, Veterinary and Food Science",

The co-occurrence of sulfur (S) and As increases the complexity of As migration and transformation in hot springs. Microorganisms play important roles in As-S transformation processes. In the present study, two Tibetan alkaline hot springs (designated Gulu [GL] and Daba [DB]) with different total As concentrations (0.88 mg/L and 12.42 mg/L, respectively) and different sulfide/As ratios (3.97 and 0.008, respectively) were selected for investigating interactions between As-S geochemistry and microbial communities along the outflow channels. The results showed that As-S transformation processes were similar, although concentrations and percentages of As and S species differed between the two hot springs. Thioarsenates were detected at the vents of the hot springs (18% and 0.32%, respectively), and were desulfurized to arsenite along the drainage channel. Arsenite was finally oxidized to arsenate (532 μg/L and 12,700 μg/L, respectively). Monothioarsenate, total As, and sulfate were the key factors shaping the changes in microbial communities with geochemical gradients. The relative abundances of sulfur reduction genes (dsrAB) and arsenate reduction genes (arsC) were higher in upstream portions of GL explaining high thiolation. Arsenite oxidation genes (aoxAB) were relatively abundant in downstream parts of GL and at the vent of DB explaining low thiolation. Sulfur oxidation genes (soxABXYZ) were abundant in GL and DB. Putative sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), such as Desulfuromusa and Clostridium, might be involved in forming thioarsenates by producing reduced S for chemical reactions with arsenite. Sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB), such as Elioraea, Pseudoxanthomonas and Pseudomonas, and arsenite-oxidizing bacteria (AsOB) such as Thermus, Sulfurihydrogenibium and Hydrogenophaga, may be responsible for the oxidation of As-bound S, thereby desulfurizing thioarsenates, forming arsenite and, by further abiotic or microbial oxidation, arsenate. This study improves our understanding of As and S biogeochemistry in hot springs.","This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 42177068, 41772260, and 91851115).",,Environmental Research,,Elsevier,"0013-9351, 1096-0953",Arsenic; Arsenates; Arsenites; Hot Springs; Uganda; Bacteria; Oxidation-Reduction; Sulfides; Microbiota; Sulfates; Sulfur,2022-12-09,2022,2022-12-09,2023-02,218,,115033,Closed,Article,"Qing, Chun; Nicol, Alan; Li, Ping; Planer-Friedrich, Britta; Yuan, Changguo; Kou, Zhu","Qing, Chun (State Key Laboratory of Biogeology and Environmental Geology, China University of Geosciences, 430074, Wuhan, Hubei, PR China; Hubei Key Laboratory of Yangtze Catchment Environmental Aquatic Science, China University of Geosciences, 430074, Wuhan, Hubei, PR China.

In this paper we present computational methods (evolutionary algorithms and random searches) to parameterize mathematical models that describe communities in stable states. The initial parameterization of the model requires only ""best guess"" estimates for parameters and can therefore be used in data-poor situations. The technique locates the stable state that occurs with minimum deviation from these parameters. Alternative stable states in which the community may exist after a disturbance event can also be assessed using this technique, even though the number of alternative states may be large. Using available but incomplete data from an intertidal grazer/biofilm community, we created a prediction of the dynamics of both a pre- and post-disturbance community. Using limited data, we then predicted the most likely post-disturbance community, which proved to be a good match to experimental data, indicating the usefulness of this technique as a predictive tool.",,,Biological Bulletin,,University of Chicago Press,"0006-3185, 1939-8697","Algorithms; Animals; Ecosystem; Feeding Behavior; Gastropoda; Models, Biological; United Kingdom",2008-10,2008,,2008-10,215,2,155-63,Closed,Article,"Stafford, Richard; Davies, Mark S; Williams, Gray A","Stafford, Richard (Department of Natural and Social Sciences, University of Gloucestershire, Cheltenham, UK. rstafford@glos.ac.uk); Davies, Mark S (); Williams, Gray A ()",,"Stafford, Richard (University of Gloucestershire); Davies, Mark S (); Williams, Gray A ()",University of Gloucestershire,grid.21027.36,Cheltenham,,United Kingdom,,,,,,1,0,,0.07,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1069983576,31 Biological Sciences; 3102 Bioinformatics and Computational Biology,Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD),,,,,B11 Computer Science and Informatics,

Isoscapes, i.e. spatially continuous observations of variations in stable isotope ratios, provide innovative methods to trace the spatial dimension of ecological processes at continental to global scales. Herein, we test the usefulness of nitrogen isoscapes (δ(15) N) for quantifying alterations in community functioning following exotic plant invasion. Nitrogen introduced by an exotic N(2) -fixing acacia could be accurately traced through the ecosystem and into the surrounding native vegetation by combining native species foliar δ(15) N with spatial information regarding plant location using geostatistical methods. The area impacted by N-addition was at least 3.5-fold greater than the physical area covered by the invader. Thus, downscaling isoscapes to the community level opens new frontiers in quantifying the spatial dimension of functional changes associated with invasion and in resolving the spatial component of within-community interactions.","Acknowledgements Funding was provided by the DFG (TRANSDUNE, WE 2681/3‐1).

Recent work has shown that selection as well as dispersal and drift shape communities, but the mechanistic bases for assembly of communities and the forces that maintain their function in the face of environmental perturbation are not well understood. Conceptually, some interactions among community members could generate endogenous dynamics in composition, even in the absence of environmental changes. These endogenous dynamics are further perturbed by exogenous forcing factors to produce a richer network of community interactions and it is this ‘system’ that is the basis for higher-order community properties. Elucidation of principles that follow from this conceptual model requires identifying the mechanisms that (a) optimize diversity within a community and (b) impart community stability.

A key objective of metagenomic studies is to analyse organism-specific metabolic pathways and reconstruct community interaction networks. This requires accurate assignment of assembled genome fragments to genomes. Existing binning methods often fail to reconstruct a reasonable number of genomes and report many bins of low quality and completeness. Furthermore, the performance of existing algorithms varies between samples and biotopes. Here, we present a dereplication, aggregation and scoring strategy, DAS Tool, that combines the strengths of a flexible set of established binning algorithms. DAS Tool applied to a constructed community generated more accurate bins than any automated method. Indeed, when applied to environmental and host-associated samples of different complexity, DAS Tool recovered substantially more near-complete genomes, including previously unreported lineages, than any single binning method alone. The ability to reconstruct many near-complete genomes from metagenomics data will greatly advance genome-centric analyses of ecosystems.","The authors thank I.

Moreover, with advances in computing and modelling methods, we are now beginning to grasp just how dynamic our interactions with these communities are. The diversity of both these communities and their interactions-both within the community and with us-are dependent on a multitude of factors, both microbial- and host-mediated. Importantly, it is becoming clear that shifts in the makeup of these communities, or their responses, are linked to different disease states. Although much of the work to define these interactions and links has been investigating bacterial communities, recently there has been significant growth in the body of knowledge, indicating that shifts in the host fungal communities (mycobiome) are also intimately linked to disease status. In this review, we will explore these associations, along with the interactions between fungal communities and their human and microbial habitat, and discuss the future applications of systems biology in determining their role in disease status.","This research was supported by King’s College London (David Moyes, Saeed Shoaie, Elizabeth A.

Both factors play a role in determining community dynamics. In addition to trophic interactions, dispersal acts as an interaction between separate populations. As with other interactions, the structure of dispersal can affect the stability of a system. However, the primary structure that has been studied in consumer-resource models has been hierarchical dispersal, where between-patch dispersal rates increase with trophic level. Here we use analytical, numerical, and simulation approaches on a two-patch, three-species metacommunity model to investigate the relationship between structure and community stability and resilience. We show that metacommunity stability is greater in systems with both weak and strong dispersal rates. Our system is stabilized by the formation of patterns when predators disperse frequently and herbivores disperse rarely, and via asynchrony when both predators and herbivores disperse infrequently. Our results show how interaction strengths within both trophic and spatial networks shape metacommunity stability.",,,The American Naturalist,,University of Chicago Press,"0003-0147, 1537-5323","Animal Distribution; Animals; Ecosystem; Food Chain; Models, Biological; Population Dynamics",2016-03-16,2016,2016-03-16,2016-05,187,5,e116-28,All OA; Green,Article,"Pedersen, Eric J; Marleau, Justin N; Granados, Monica; Moeller, Holly V; Guichard, Frédéric","Pedersen, Eric J (); Marleau, Justin N (); Granados, Monica (); Moeller, Holly V (); Guichard, Frédéric ()",,"Pedersen, Eric J (); Marleau, Justin N (); Granados, Monica (); Moeller, Holly V (); Guichard, Frédéric ()",,,,,,Directorate for Biological Sciences,NSF - National Science Foundation; US Federal Funders,United States,grant.3483471,1300426,23,13,0.59,3.54,11,http://research.library.mun.ca/13053/1/685773.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1058867069,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,A05 Biological Sciences,

However, very few studies have actually attempted to quantify the role of rare species in ecosystems. Here we compare effects of soil community assemblages on plant-herbivore interactions and show that reduction of rare soil microbes increases both plant biomass and plant nutritional quality. Two crop plant species growing in soil where rare microbes were reduced, had tissues of higher nutritional quality, which theoretically makes them more susceptible to pest organisms such as shoot-feeding aphids and root-feeding nematodes. Reduction of rare microbes increased aphid body size in the absence of nematodes; nematodes always reduced aphid body size independent of the soil microbial community. This study is the first to show that rare soil microbes are not redundant but may play a role in crop protection by enhancing aboveground and belowground plant defence. It remains to be tested whether these are direct effects of rare soil microbes on plants and herbivores, or indirect effects via shifts in the microbial soil community assemblages.","We thank Ciska Raaijmakers, Wiecher Smant and Roel Wagenaar for assistance; Richard Bardgett for comments on earlier versions of the manuscript.

This has led to differences in conclusions and interpretations of how the number of species in a community affects its stability. Here, we derive a simple, general relationship between the coefficient of variation (CV) of combined species densities and the environmentally driven variability in species' per capita population growth rates. For a given level of environmentally driven variability in per capita population growth rates, increasing the number of species in a community decreases the CV of combined species densities, provided that species do not respond to environmental fluctuations in a perfectly correlated way. Thus, a community with more species of competitors will be more stable (have lower CV in combined species densities for a given level of environmental variability) than a species-poor community, provided that the species in both communities show equal variability in per capita population growth rates and provided that species within each community do not show strongly correlated responses to environmental fluctuations.

It is often unclear how to accurately incorporate these interactions into predictive models. Previous work has shown a range of positive and negative metabolic pairwise interactions between species. Here we examine the ability of a modified general Lotka-Volterra model with cell-cell interaction coefficients to predict the overall metabolic rate of a well-mixed microbial community comprised of four heterotrophic natural isolates, experimentally quantifying the strengths of two, three, and four-species interactions. Within this community, interactions between any pair of microbial species were positive, while higher-order interactions, between 3 or more microbial species, slightly modulated community metabolism. For this simple community, the metabolic rate of can be well predicted only with taking into account pairwise interactions. Simulations using the experimentally determined interaction parameters revealed that spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of cells increased the importance of multispecies interactions in dictating function at both the local and global scales.","This work was supported by Office of Naval Research award number N00014-15-1-2573, http://www.onr.navy.mil/.

As a result of the specific mechanisms of bacteriocin recognition and translocation into the target cell it is assumed that these toxins mediate intra-specific or population-level interactions. However, no published studies specifically address this question. We present here a survey of bacteriocin production in a collection of enteric bacteria isolated from wild mammals in Australia. A subset of the bacteriocin-producing strains was assayed for the ability to kill a broad range of enteric bacteria from the same bacterial collection. A novel method of estimating killing breadth was developed and used to compare the surveyed bacteriocins in terms of the phylogenetic range over which they kill. The most striking result is that although bacteriocin-producers kill members of their own species most frequently, some kill phylogenetically distant taxa more frequently than they kill closer relatives. This study calls into question the role these toxins play in natural populations. A significant number of bacteriocins are highly effective in killing inter-specific strains and thus bacteriocins may serve to mediate bacterial community interactions.","This work was funded by the National Institutes of Health (GM58433‐02) and the National Science Foundation (DEB‐9458247).

In this study, we analyzed a bacterial community from circumneutral-pH tropical stream sediment by 16S rRNA and shotgun deep sequencing. Carrapatos stream sediment, which has been exposed to metal stress due to gold and iron mining (21 [g Fe]/kg), revealed a diverse community, with predominance of Proteobacteria (39.4%), Bacteroidetes (12.2%), and Parcubacteria (11.4%). Among Proteobacteria, the most abundant reads were assigned to neutrophilic iron-oxidizing taxa, such as Gallionella, Sideroxydans, and Mariprofundus, which are involved in Fe cycling and harbor several metal resistance genes. Functional analysis revealed a large number of genes participating in nitrogen and methane metabolic pathways despite the low concentrations of inorganic nitrogen in the Carrapatos stream.

Historically, most studies of ants and their symbionts have had a narrow taxonomic scope, often focusing on a single ant or symbiont species. Here we discuss the prospects of studying these assemblies in a community ecology context using the framework of ecological network analysis. We introduce three basic network metrics that we consider particularly relevant for improving our knowledge of ant-symbiont communities: interaction specificity, network modularity, and phylogenetic signal. We then discuss army ant symbionts as examples of large and primarily parasitic communities, and symbiotic sternorrhynchans as examples of generally smaller and primarily mutualistic communities in the context of these network analyses. We argue that this approach will provide new and complementary insights into the evolutionary and ecological dynamics between ants and their many associates, and will facilitate comparisons across different ant-symbiont assemblages as well as across different types of ecological networks.","We thank Alex Wild, Takashi Komatsu, and Daryline Murawski for providing photographs; Bobo Nick for help with network visualization; Jens Olesen for discussions of network modularity; Joseph Parker for comments on parts of the manuscript; two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments; and Konrad Fiedler and Michael Staab for providing data on an ant-hemipteran network.

Recent syntheses outline potential applications of network theory to ecological systems, but do not address the implications of physical structure for network dynamics. There is a specific need to examine how dendritic habitat structure, such as that found in stream, hedgerow and cave networks, influences ecological processes. Although dendritic networks are one type of ecological network, they are distinguished by two fundamental characteristics: (1) both the branches and the nodes serve as habitat, and (2) the specific spatial arrangement and hierarchical organization of these elements interacts with a species' movement behaviour to alter patterns of population distribution and abundance, and community interactions. Here, we summarize existing theory relating to ecological dynamics in dendritic networks, review empirical studies examining the population- and community-level consequences of these networks, and suggest future research integrating spatial pattern and processes in dendritic systems.","We thank Larissa Bailey, Katia Engelhardt, Jim Nichols, Clint Otto, Margaret Palmer, Katie Schneider and Pamela Toschik for commenting on this manuscript, and for topical expertise that aided sections of the manuscript.

Enteric AdVs probably disrupt gut microbial defences, which can result in diarrhea. To understand the role of the gut microbiome in AdV-induced pathologies, we investigated the gut microbiome of a naturally AdV-infected non-human primate species, the Malagasy mouse lemur (Microcebus griseorufus), which represents an important model in understanding the evolution of diseases. We observed that AdV infection is associated with disruption of the gut microbial community composition. In AdV+ lemurs, several commensal taxa essential for a healthy gut microbiome decreased, whereas genera containing potential pathogens, such as Neisseria, increased in abundance. Microbial co-occurrence networks revealed a loss of important microbial community interactions in AdV+ lemurs and an overrepresentation of Prevotellaceae. The observation of enteric virus-associated loss of commensal bacteria and associated shifts towards pathobionts may represent the missing link for a better understanding of AdV-induced effects in humans, and also for their potential as drivers of co-infections, an area of research that has been largely neglected so far.","The study was carried out under the collaboration between Madagascar National Parks, the Department of Animal Biology, Department of Plant Biology and Ecology (Antananarivo University, Madagascar) and the Department of Animal Ecology and Conservation (Hamburg University, Germany).

Yet, due to methodological and technical challenges very little is known about the mediation of these interactions and their effect on cetaceans' behavior. Killer whales (Orcinus orca) are a highly vocal species and can be both food competitors and potential predators of many other cetaceans. Thus, the interception of their vocalizations by unintended cetacean receivers may be particularly important in mediating interspecific interactions. To address this hypothesis, we conducted playbacks of killer whale vocalizations recorded during herring-feeding activity to free-ranging long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas). Using a multi-sensor tag, we were able to track the whales and to monitor changes of their movements and social behavior in response to the playbacks. We demonstrated that the playback of killer whale sounds to pilot whales induced a clear increase in group size and a strong attraction of the animals towards the sound source. These findings provide the first experimental evidence that the interception of heterospecific vocalizations can mediate interactions between different cetacean species in previously unrecognized ways.","This study was mainly funded by three naval organisations: the US Office of Naval Research, the Norwegian Ministry of Defense and the Netherlands Ministry of Defense.

Using a 20-year experiment, where 50 non-resident (but mostly native) grassland plant species were sown into savannah plots, we ask how traits linked with invasion depend on invasion stage (establishment, spread), indicator of invasion success (occupancy, relative abundance), time, environmental conditions, propagule rain, and traits of invaders and invaded communities. Trait data for 164 taxa showed that invader occupancy was primarily associated with traits of invaders, traits of recipient communities, and invader-community interactions. Invader abundance was more strongly associated with community traits (e.g. proportion legume) and trait differences between invaders and the most similar resident species. Annuals and invaders with high-specific leaf area were only successful early in stand development, whereas invaders with conservative carbon capture strategies persisted long-term. Our results indicate that invasion is context-dependent and long-term experiments are required to comprehensively understand invasions.","We thank Troy Mielke for coordinating research at Cedar Creek, Mara Sagedahl and Christine Carroll for help with trait data collection, Cedar Creek interns for assisting with vegetation surveys and Wade Blanchard for statistical advice.

With major microbial ecology research efforts accumulating prodigious quantities of sequence, protein, and metabolite data, we are now poised to address environmental microbial research at macro scales, and to begin to characterize and understand the dimensions of microbial biodiversity on the planet. What is currently impeding progress is the need for a framework within which the research community can develop, exchange and discuss predictive ecosystem models that describe the biodiversity and functional interactions. Such a framework must encompass data and metadata transparency and interoperation; data and results validation, curation, and search; application programming interfaces for modeling and analysis tools; and human and technical processes and services necessary to ensure broad adoption. Here we discuss the need for focused community interaction to augment and deepen established community efforts, beginning with the Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC), to create a science-driven strategic plan for a Genomic Software Institute (GSI).","We would like to thank the board of the Genomic Standards Consortium for their valuable insight, especially Dr Renzo Kottman.

This review focusses on the interactions between macroalgae and their Epiphytic Bacterial Community (EBC); the main aims are to ascertain whether (1) the epiphytic bacterial groups differ at the phylum and genus levels of the macroalgae; (2) the methodologies used so far to study these microorganisms are related in any way to eventual variations of the EBCs on macroalgae; and (3) the EBC of macroalgae has a functional means rather a simple taxonomic grouping. Results showed firstly the taxonomic grouping of macroalgae does not explain the composition and structure of the EBCs. Secondly, the methodology used is important for describing EBCs; and thirdly, multiple bacteria can have the same function and thus to describe the functionality of EBCs it is important to recognize host-specific and generalist bacteria. We recommend the incorporation of a complementary approach between the taxonomic composition and the functional composition analyzes of EBCs, as well as the use of methodological tools that allow analysis of interactions between the EBCs and their hosts, based on the ""holobiont"" concept.","Special thanks to Ana María Zárate for her support and orientation in the elaboration of the heatmaps, using R software and Susan Angus for translating the manuscript.","Funding.

Their close relatives, the bonobos (Pan paniscus), differ in startling and significant ways. For instance, female bonobos bond with one another, form coalitions, and dominate males. A pattern of reluctance to consider, let alone acknowledge, female dominance in bonobos exists, however. Because both species are equally ""man's"" closest relative, the bonobo social system complicates models of human evolution that have historically been based upon referents that are male and chimpanzee-like. The bonobo evidence suggests that models of human evolution must be reformulated such that they also accommodate: real and meaningful female bonds; the possibility of systematic female dominance over males; female mating strategies which encompass extra-group paternities; hunting and meat distribution by females; the importance of the sharing of plant foods; affinitive inter-community interactions; males that do not stalk and attack and are not territorial; and flexible social relationships in which philopatry does not necessarily predict bonding pattern.",,,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,,Wiley,"0077-8923, 1749-6632","Animals; Biological Evolution; Female; Hominidae; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Pan paniscus; Sexual Behavior, Animal",2000-04,2000,2006-01-25,2000-04,907,1,97-113,Closed,Article,"PARISH, AMY R.; DE WAAL, FRANS B.

In marine systems, species introductions are the result of a number of anthropogenic mechanisms, notably shipping, aquaculture/mariculture, the pet and bait trades, and the creation of canals. Marine invasions are a global threat to human and non-human populations alike and are often listed as one of the top conservation concerns worldwide, having ecological, evolutionary, and social ramifications. Evolutionary investigations of marine invasions can provide crucial insight into an introduced species' potential impacts in its new range, including: physiological adaptation and behavioral changes to exploit new environments; changes in resident populations, community interactions, and ecosystems; and severe reductions in genetic diversity that may limit evolutionary potential in the introduced range. This special issue focuses on current research advances in the evolutionary biology of marine invasions and can be broadly classified into a few major avenues of research: the evolutionary history of invasive populations, post-invasion reproductive changes, and the role of evolution in parasite introductions. Together, they demonstrate the value of investigating marine invasions from an evolutionary perspective, with benefits to both fundamental and applied evolutionary biology at local and broad scales.",We thank the organizers of Marine Evolution 2018 for bringing together a dynamic group of researchers working in all aspects of marine evolutionary biology and for facilitating the discussion of evolution in marine invasion.

Several key areas are reviewed in which phylogenetic information helps to resolve long-standing controversies in community ecology, challenges previous assumptions, and opens new areas of investigation. In particular, studies in phylogenetic community ecology have helped to reveal the multitude of processes driving community assembly and have demonstrated the importance of evolution in the assembly process. Phylogenetic approaches have also increased understanding of the consequences of community interactions for speciation, adaptation and extinction. Finally, phylogenetic community structure and composition holds promise for predicting ecosystem processes and impacts of global change. Major challenges to advancing these areas remain. In particular, determining the extent to which ecologically relevant traits are phylogenetically conserved or convergent, and over what temporal scale, is critical to understanding the causes of community phylogenetic structure and its evolutionary and ecosystem consequences. Harnessing phylogenetic information to understand and forecast changes in diversity and dynamics of communities is a critical step in managing and restoring the Earth's biota in a time of rapid global change.","This work was supported by funding from the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), the Long‐Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network Office and the National Science Foundation (NSF) DEB‐0620652 (JCB); NSF DEB‐0824599 (KHK); NSF DEB‐0743800 (PVAF), and a postdoctoral fellowship from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) to S.W.K.

Using field data and experiments, I test whether mutualisms have been incorporated into large-scale wildfire by whether the outcomes of a mutualism depend on disturbance. In this study a seed dispersal mutualism is shown to depend on infrequent, large-scale disturbances. A dominant shrubland plant (Arctostaphylos species) produces seeds that make up a persistent soil seed bank and requires fire to germinate. In post-fire stands, I show that seedlings emerging from rodent caches dominate sites experiencing higher fire intensity. Field experiments show that rodents (Perimyscus californicus, P. boylii) do cache Arctostaphylos fruit and bury most seed caches to a sufficient depth to survive a killing heat pulse that a fire might drive into the soil. While the rodent dispersal and caching behavior itself has not changed compared to other habitats, the environmental transformation caused by wildfire converts the caching burial of seed from a dispersal process to a plant fire adaptive trait, and provides the context for stimulating subsequent life history evolution in the plant host.","This research was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation (USA) #0948627.

Multiple risk factors make an animal susceptible to BRD. The presence of Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, and Mycoplasma bovis in lung tissues have been associated with BRD mortalities, but they are also commonly present in the upper respiratory tract of healthy animals. This study aims to compare the cattle nasal microbiome (diversity, composition and community interaction) and the abundance of BRD pathogens (by qPCR) in the nasal microbiome of Holstein steers that are apparently healthy (Healthy group, n = 75) or with BRD clinical signs (BRD group, n = 58). We then used random forest models based on nasal microbial community and qPCR results to classify healthy and BRD-affected animals and determined the agreement with the visual clinical signs. Additionally, co-occurring species pairs were identified in visually BRD or healthy animal groups.ResultsCattle in the BRD group had lower alpha diversity than pen-mates in the healthy group. Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) from Trueperella pyogenes, Bibersteinia and Mycoplasma spp. were increased in relative abundance in the BRD group, while ASVs from Mycoplasma bovirhinis and Clostridium sensu stricto were increased in the healthy group. Prevalence of H. somni (98%) and P. multocida (97%) was high regardless of BRD clinical signs whereas M. haemolytica (81 and 61%, respectively) and M. bovis (74 and 51%, respectively) were more prevalent in the BRD group than the healthy group. In the BRD group, the abundance of M. haemolytica and M. bovis was increased, while H. somni abundance was decreased. Visual observation of clinical signs agreed with classification by the nasal microbial community (misclassification rate of 32%) and qPCR results (misclassification rate 34%). Co-occurrence analysis demonstrated that the nasal microbiome of BRD-affected cattle presented fewer bacterial associations than healthy cattle.ConclusionsThis study offers insight into the prevalence and abundance of BRD pathogens and the differences in the nasal microbiome between healthy and BRD animals. This suggests that nasal bacterial communities provide a potential platform for future studies and potential pen-side diagnostic testing.",Not applicable.,"This work was supported by the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grants Program Award 2020-68014-31302 from the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

With only a limited number of ""traditional"" virulence factors, the mechanisms underlying the success of this pathogen remain of great interest. Major advances have been made in the tools, reagents, and models to study A. baumannii pathogenesis, and this has resulted in a substantial increase in knowledge. This article provides a comprehensive review of the bacterial virulence factors, the host immune responses, and animal models applicable for the study of this important human pathogen. Collating the most recent evidence characterizing bacterial virulence factors, their cellular targets and genetic regulation, we have encompassed numerous aspects important to the success of this pathogen, including membrane proteins and cell surface adaptations promoting immune evasion, mechanisms for nutrient acquisition and community interactions. The role of innate and adaptive immune responses is reviewed and areas of paucity in our understanding are highlighted.

1464,pub.1035015148,10.1890/10-1354.1,21661547,,,Predicting community responses to perturbations in the face of imperfect knowledge and network complexity,"How best to predict the effects of perturbations to ecological communities has been a long-standing goal for both applied and basic ecology. This quest has recently been revived by new empirical data, new analysis methods, and increased computing speed, with the promise that ecologically important insights may be obtainable from a limited knowledge of community interactions. We use empirically based and simulated networks of varying size and connectance to assess two limitations to predicting perturbation responses in multispecies communities: (1) the inaccuracy by which species interaction strengths are empirically quantified and (2) the indeterminacy of species responses due to indirect effects associated with network size and structure. We find that even modest levels of species richness and connectance (-25 pairwise interactions) impose high requirements for interaction strength estimates because system indeterminacy rapidly overwhelms predictive insights. Nevertheless, even poorly estimated interaction strengths provide greater average predictive certainty than an approach that uses only the sign of each interaction. Our simulations provide guidance in dealing with the trade-offs involved in maximizing the utility of network approaches for predicting dynamics in multispecies communities.","This article was written as part of the “Conservation Planning for Ecosystem Functioning: Testing Predictions of Ecological Effectiveness for Marine Predators” working group at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis.

Due to their close proximity, these microbes interact among themselves, and also with the hosts in both positive and negative manners. Moreover, these interactions may modulate dynamically upon external stimulus as well as internal community changes. This demands systematic techniques such as mathematical modeling to understand the intrinsic community behavior. Here, we reviewed various approaches for metabolic modeling of microbial communities. If detailed species-specific information is available, segregated models of individual organisms can be constructed and connected via metabolite exchanges; otherwise, the community may be represented as a lumped network of metabolic reactions. The constructed models can then be simulated to help fill knowledge gaps, and generate testable hypotheses for designing new experiments. More importantly, such community models have been developed to study microbial interactions in various niches such as host microbiome, biogeochemical and bioremediation, waste water treatment and synthetic consortia. As such, the metabolic modeling efforts have allowed us to gain new insights into the natural and synthetic microbial communities, and design interventions to achieve specific goals. Finally, potential directions for future development in metabolic modeling of microbial communities were also discussed.","This work was supported by the Biomedical Research Council of A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research), Singapore, and a grant from the Next-Generation BioGreen 21 Program (SSAC, No. PJ01334605), Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea.",,Current Genomics,,Bentham Science Publishers,"1389-2029, 1875-5488",,2018-12-01,2018,2018-12-01,2018-12,19,8,712-722,All OA; Green,Article,"Ang, Kok Siong; Lakshmanan, Meiyappan; Lee, Na-Rae; Lee, Dong-Yup","Ang, Kok Siong (1Bioprocessing Technology Institute (BTI), A*STAR, Singapore 138668, Singapore; 2Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, and NUS Synthetic Biology for Clinical and Technological Innovation (SynCTI), National University of Singapore, Singapore 117585, Singapore; 3School of Chemical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, 2066 Seobu-ro, Jangan-gu, Suwon, Gyeonggi-do16419, Republic of Korea); Lakshmanan, Meiyappan (1Bioprocessing Technology Institute (BTI), A*STAR, Singapore 138668, Singapore; 2Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, and NUS Synthetic Biology for Clinical and Technological Innovation (SynCTI), National University of Singapore, Singapore 117585, Singapore; 3School of Chemical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, 2066 Seobu-ro, Jangan-gu, Suwon, Gyeonggi-do16419, Republic of Korea); Lee, Na-Rae (1Bioprocessing Technology Institute (BTI), A*STAR, Singapore 138668, Singapore; 2Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, and NUS Synthetic Biology for Clinical and Technological Innovation (SynCTI), National University of Singapore, Singapore 117585, Singapore; 3School of Chemical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, 2066 Seobu-ro, Jangan-gu, Suwon, Gyeonggi-do16419, Republic of Korea); Lee, Dong-Yup (1Bioprocessing Technology Institute (BTI), A*STAR, Singapore 138668, Singapore; 2Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, and NUS Synthetic Biology for Clinical and Technological Innovation (SynCTI), National University of Singapore, Singapore 117585, Singapore; 3School of Chemical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, 2066 Seobu-ro, Jangan-gu, Suwon, Gyeonggi-do16419, Republic of Korea)","Lee, Dong-Yup (Agency for Science, Technology and Research; National University of Singapore; Sungkyunkwan University)","Ang, Kok Siong (Agency for Science, Technology and Research; National University of Singapore; Sungkyunkwan University); Lakshmanan, Meiyappan (Agency for Science, Technology and Research; National University of Singapore; Sungkyunkwan University); Lee, Na-Rae (Agency for Science, Technology and Research; National University of Singapore; Sungkyunkwan University); Lee, Dong-Yup (Agency for Science, Technology and Research; National University of Singapore; Sungkyunkwan University)","National University of Singapore; Agency for Science, Technology and Research; Sungkyunkwan University",grid.4280.e; grid.185448.4; grid.264381.a,Singapore; Singapore; Seoul,; ; ,Singapore; Singapore; South Korea,"Rural Development Administration; Agency for Science, Technology and Research",,South Korea; Singapore,,,24,17,0.81,3.12,,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc6225453?pdf=render,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1106962857,31 Biological Sciences; 3107 Microbiology,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,14 Life Below Water

Experimental studies have shown that the evolution of host defense mechanisms to a focal enemy is impacted by the surrounding enemy community. Theoretically, the evolution of host defenses against a single enemy population, typically parasites, has been widely studied, but only recently has the impact of community interactions on host-parasite evolution been looked at. In this article, we theoretically examine the evolutionary behavior of a host population that must allocate defenses between two enemy populations, parasites and predators, with defense against one enemy constraining defense against the other. We show that in simpler models the composition of the enemy community plays the key role in determining the defense strategy of the hosts, with the hosts building up defenses against the enemy population posing a larger threat. However, this simple driver is shown to break down when there is significant recovery and reproduction from infected hosts. Additionally, we find that most host diversity is likely to occur when there is a combined high risk of infection and predation, in common with experimental studies. Our results therefore provide vital insight into the ecological feedbacks that drive the evolution of host defense against multiple enemy populations.",,,The American Naturalist,,University of Chicago Press,"0003-0147, 1537-5323","Animals; Biological Evolution; Food Chain; Host-Parasite Interactions; Models, Biological; Predatory Behavior",2016-01-08,2016,2016-01-08,2016-03,187,3,308-19,All OA; Green,Article,"Toor, Jaspreet; Best, Alex","Toor, Jaspreet (); Best, Alex ()",,"Toor, Jaspreet (); Best, Alex ()",,,,,,,,,,,10,4,0.49,,1,http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/90677/10/684682.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1058866019,31 Biological Sciences,Biodefense; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Prevention; Vaccine Related,,,,,A05 Biological Sciences,

Most analytical approaches, however, assume static species interactions and environmental effects across time. Therefore, we applied multivariate autoregressive (MAR) models in a moving window context to test for shifting plankton community interactions and effects of environmental variables on plankton abundance in Lake Washington, U.S.A. from 1962-1994, following reduced nutrient loading in the 1960s and the rise of Daphnia in the 1970s. The moving-window MAR (mwMAR) approach showed shifts in the strengths of interactions between Daphnia, a dominant grazer, and other plankton taxa between a high nutrient, Oscillatoria-dominated regime and a low nutrient, Daphnia-dominated regime. The approach also highlighted the inhibiting influence of the cyanobacterium Oscillatoria on other plankton taxa in the community. Overall community stability was lowest during the period of elevated nutrient loading and Oscillatoria dominance. Despite recent warming of the lake, we found no evidence that anomalous temperatures impacted plankton abundance. Our results suggest mwMAR modeling is a useful approach that can be applied across diverse ecosystems, when questions involve shifting relationships within food webs, and among species and abiotic drivers.","This research was initiated while TBF held a National Research Council Research Associateship Award at NOAA&#x27;s Northwest Fisheries Science Center, and conducted in part while TBF was employed by the Puget Sound Institute, funded by the Environmental Protection Agency (Grant #PC-00J303-01).

East China Sea experiences annual successions of Skeletonema costatum and Prorocentrum donghaiense and large-scale blooms of P. donghaiense. In this study, the growth and competition responses of S. costatum and P. donghaiense to different inorganic nutrients structure were evaluated through field and indoors experiments to further understand the nutrients mechanism of these events. Results showed that low Si/N ratio (Si/N<1) and high N/P (>50) possibly accelerated P. donghaiense outbreak and decreased Si/N caused by low Si concentration could speed up S. costatum decay. Excessive DIN also accelerated blooms dominated by P. donghaiense (Dt up to -3) when S. costatum perished. Increased DIN loads from anthropogenic activities were possibly responsible for the changes in phytoplankton communities and dinoflagellate outbreak when Si concentration decreased as a result of governmental control efforts. With effective management practices for Si and P reductions worldwide, managers should be aware of the negative implications of unsuccessful management of system N loading because N may significantly alter the composition and ecosystem of phytoplankton communities.","We thank the captain and crew of the Runjiang 1 for the field assistance and providing access to field sampling.

Bacteria produce metabolites to protect and influence the growth and life cycle of their eukaryotic hosts. In turn, the host provides a nutrient-enriched environment for the bacteria. Here, we discuss the role of waterborne chemical mediators that are responsible for such interactions in aquatic multi-partner systems, including algae or invertebrates and their associated bacteria. In particular, this review highlights recent advances in the chemical ecology of aquatic systems that support the overall ecological significance of signaling molecules across the prokaryote–eukaryote boundary (cross-kingdom interactions) for growth, development and morphogenesis of the host. We emphasize the value of establishing well-characterized model systems that provide the basis for the development of ecological principles that represent the natural lifestyle and dynamics of aquatic microbial communities and enable a better understanding of the consequences of environmental change and the most effective means of managing community interactions.","The authors are grateful for financial support from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) for Grant SFB 1127 ChemBioSys (T.W., C.B.) and Exsphingo (C.B.).

Quorum sensing involves production of and response to diffusible or secreted signals, which can vary substantially across different types of bacteria. In many species, quorum sensing modulates virulence functions and is important for pathogenesis. Over the past half-century, there has been a significant accumulation of knowledge of the molecular mechanisms, signal structures, gene regulons, and behavioral responses associated with quorum-sensing systems in diverse bacteria. More recent studies have focused on understanding quorum sensing in the context of bacterial sociality. Studies of the role of quorum sensing in cooperative and competitive microbial interactions have revealed how quorum sensing coordinates interactions both within a species and between species. Such studies of quorum sensing as a social behavior have relied on the development of ""synthetic ecological"" models that use nonclonal bacterial populations. In this review, we discuss some of these models and recent advances in understanding how microbes might interact with one another using quorum sensing.

Within-network interactions mirrored the human gut microbiota relationships, with a strong co-exclusion between Prevotella and Ruminococcus genera, and were consistent with the two enterotype-like clusters identified in the pig microbiota. Remarkably, the cluster classification of the individuals was significantly associated with the body weight at 60 days of age (P=0.005) and average daily gain (P=0.027). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide an integrated overview of the porcine gut microbiota that suggests a conservation of the ecological community interactions and functional architecture between humans and pig. Moreover, we show that the microbial ecosystems and porcine growth traits are linked, which allows us to foresee that the enterotype concept may have an important role in the animal production industry.","The project was funded by the French National Agency (project SUS_FLORA, ANR-10-GENM-016).

Direct and indirect community interactions between ants and pests lead to differential spatial pattern. We investigated spatial interactions between mirids, the major cocoa pest in West Africa and numerically dominant ant species, using bivariate point pattern analysis to identify potential biological control agents. We assume that potential biological control agents should display negative spatial interactions with mirids considering their niche overlap. The mirid/ant data were collected in complex cacao-based agroforestry systems sampled in three agroecological areas over a forest-savannah gradient in Cameroon. Three species, Crematogaster striatula Emery (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), Crematogaster clariventris Mayr (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), and Oecophylla longinoda Latreille (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) with high predator and aggressive behaviors were identified as dominant and showed negative spatial relationships with mirids. The weaver ant, O. longinoda was identified as the only potential biological control agent, considering its ubiquity in the plots, the similarity in niche requirements, and the spatial segregation with mirids resulting probably from exclusion mechanisms. Combining bivariate point pattern analysis to good knowledge of insect ecology was an effective method to identify a potentially good biological control agent.","We thank the farmers of Bokito, Obala, and Ngomedzap for allowing us to carry out the present study in their cacao farms.

The metabolic pathways and intermediates produced during their degradation, however, are poorly understood. In this study, we investigate an anaerobic wastewater community that metabolizes naproxen via demethylation. Enriched cultures, established from anaerobic digester inocula receiving naproxen as the sole carbon source, transformed naproxen to 6-O-desmethylnaproxen (DMN) within 22 days. Continual enrichment and culture transfer resulted in consistent demethylation of naproxen with no loss of DMN observed. Methane was generated at 0.83 mmol per 1 mmol transformed naproxen. In addition to naproxen, the consortium readily demethylated syringic acid and vanillic acid. DNA analysis revealed a community of acetogenic bacteria and syntrophic acetate oxidizing archaea. Combined with the biotransformation data, this suggests the enriched consortium performs aromatic O-demethylation through a syntrophic relationship between specific acetogens, acetate oxidizers, and methanogens. The proposed model of carbon transfer through the anaerobic food web highlights the significance of linked community interactions in the anaerobic transformation of aromatic O-methyl compounds such as naproxen.",The authors gratefully acknowledge Tom Villani and the labs of Dr. James Simon and Dr. Alan Goldman for the analysis support.

However, there is little data on how widespread, species-specific or diverse such phenomena are. Focusing on Streptomycetes, a platform was developed for quantification of germination and early growth within communities of spores. We found that the germination process is stochastic at three levels: spores vary in their germination times, mycelium networks grow at different rates, and a fraction of germlings stall their growth shortly after germination. Furthermore, by monitoring how these stochastic properties are affected by spore density and chemicals released from spores, germination interactions were quantified for four species. Stochastically germinating spores were frequently promoted or inhibited by compounds released by spores from the same or different species, and all species had distinct interaction profiles. The spatial distribution patterns were important with clusters of spores behaving differently than individual spores. Aged spores exhibited higher dormancy but could efficiently geminate in the presence of chemicals released during germination. All interactions were specific to germination and only weakly affected growth rates. This work suggests that stochastic germination is commonly affected by the community context and species have adapted diverse germination strategies.","We thank John Barkei for setting up the microscope system, Erik Wright for assisting with phylogeny, Justin Nodwell for providing S. coelicolor A3(2) M145, and Jerald Ensign, Erik Wright, Sri Ram, Sailendharan Sudakaran for helpful discussions.

Are all communities created equal? We examine how mammalian carnivoran communities are assembled with regard to mass, diet, and locomotion. Here, we use a multivariate nearest-neighbor framework to examine multiple North American localities spanning 3 million years to determine whether community assembly is consistent through time and four modern localities around the world to assess the effects of habitat. Additionally, we examined how trait patterns differ among families and how family-level evolutionary effects affect them. We found some broadly consistent patterns, although differences are more pronounced than similarities. Diet is more affected by evolutionary constraints than by time or place. Locomotion is most affected by habitat, and the ability to partition niches is related to habitat heterogeneity. Mass is influenced by family, but also by habitat and the mass-selective extinction events at the end-Pleistocene.

Organisms often have smaller body sizes under warmer climates (Bergmann's rule and the temperature-size rule), and body size is a major determinant of life histories, demography, population size, nutrient turnover rate, and food-web structure. Therefore, by altering body sizes in whole communities, current warming can potentially disrupt ecosystem function and services. However, the underlying drivers of warming-induced body downsizing remain far from clear. Here, we show that thermal clines in body size are predicted from universal laws of ecology and metabolism, so that size-dependent selection from competition (both intra and interspecific) and predation favors smaller individuals under warmer conditions. We validate this prediction using 4.1 × 10(6) individual body size measurements from French river fish spanning 29 years and 52 species. Our results suggest that warming-induced body downsizing is an emergent property of size-structured food webs, and highlight the need to consider trophic interactions when predicting biosphere reorganizations under global warming.","This study was supported by research grants from the French National Research Agency (ANR BLANC, PHYTBACK project 10‐BLAN‐1709‐01, ANR CEP&amp;S, PULSE project, ANR PEXT, EVORANGE project).

Within the complex community interactions, we can shed new light on dynamics by which co-evolutionary outcomes can inform science-led conservation. Here we assessed host-ant use in six populations of the butterfly Phengaris (=Maculinea) rebeli, an obligate social parasite of Myrmica ants and a model system in evolutionary and conservation ecology. Starting from the initial distribution of eggs, we estimated the survival of the parasite in the wild in nests of seven Myrmica ant species, and analysed the chemical cues evolved by the parasites to subvert its host defences. We found local variations in host specificity that are consistent with similarities found in the chemical profiles of hosts and parasites on different sites. At some sites, only one ant species is successfully exploited; at others, multiple-host populations are used. Understanding how stable or adaptable these associations are is essential knowledge when devising conservation measures to maintain keystone species of ant and locally adapted populations of Phengaris butterfly species, which are rare, threatened and a high priority for conservation worldwide.","Authors wish to dedicate this work to Graham Elmes, one of the leading experts of Myrmica ants all over the world, a great scientist, and a greater man and friend who checked the identification of the ants we collected in this work.",,Scientific Reports,,Springer Nature,2045-2322,Animals; Ants; Butterflies; Ecosystem; Host Specificity; Host-Parasite Interactions; Italy; Larva,2019-02-07,2019,2019-02-07,,9,1,1619,All OA; Gold,Article,"Casacci, Luca Pietro; Schönrogge, Karsten; Thomas, Jeremy Ambler; Balletto, Emilio; Bonelli, Simona; Barbero, Francesca","Casacci, Luca Pietro (Museum and Institute of Zoology, Polish Academy of Sciences, 00-679, Warsaw, Poland; Department of Life Sciences and Systems Biology, University of Turin, 10123, Turin, Italy); Schönrogge, Karsten (Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, OX10 8BB, Wallingford, United Kingdom); Thomas, Jeremy Ambler (Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, OX1 3PS, Oxford, United Kingdom); Balletto, Emilio (Department of Life Sciences and Systems Biology, University of Turin, 10123, Turin, Italy); Bonelli, Simona (Department of Life Sciences and Systems Biology, University of Turin, 10123, Turin, Italy); Barbero, Francesca (Department of Life Sciences and Systems Biology, University of Turin, 10123, Turin, Italy)","Casacci, Luca Pietro (Museum and Institute of Zoology; University of Turin); Barbero, Francesca (University of Turin)","Casacci, Luca Pietro (Museum and Institute of Zoology; University of Turin); Schönrogge, Karsten (UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology); Thomas, Jeremy Ambler (University of Oxford); Balletto, Emilio (University of Turin); Bonelli, Simona (University of Turin); Barbero, Francesca (University of Turin)",UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology; University of Turin; University of Oxford; Museum and Institute of Zoology,grid.494924.6; grid.7605.4; grid.4991.5; grid.425940.e,Wallingford; Turin; Oxford; Warsaw,; Piemonte; Oxfordshire; ,United Kingdom; Italy; United Kingdom; Poland,Natural Environment Research Council,cOAlition S; UKRI - UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,grant.2772709,NE/G001901/1,13,5,0.53,2.21,1,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-38172-4.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1111979360,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4101 Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation,,Infection,2.2 Factors relating to the physical environment,,,A05 Biological Sciences,15 Life on Land

However, little is known about microbial activity and dynamics in relation to process fluctuations in EBPR ecosystems. Here, we monitored temporal changes in microbial community structure and potential activity across each bioreactor zone in a pilot-scale EBPR treatment plant by examining the ratio of small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) to SSU rRNA gene (rDNA) over a 120 day study period. Although the majority of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the EBPR ecosystem were rare, many maintained high potential activities based on SSU rRNA : rDNA ratios, suggesting that rare OTUs contribute substantially to protein synthesis potential in EBPR ecosystems. Few significant differences in OTU abundance and activity were observed between bioreactor redox zones, although differences in temporal activity were observed among phylogenetically cohesive OTUs. Moreover, observed temporal activity patterns could not be explained by measured process parameters, suggesting that other ecological drivers, such as grazing or viral lysis, modulated community interactions.

In this article we report results of a 3-year, fully factorial experimental study exploring how warming, snow addition, and their combination affect reproductive phenology, effort, and success of four alpine plant species belonging to three different life forms in a semiarid, alpine meadow ecosystem on the central Tibetan Plateau. Our results indicate that warming and snow addition change reproductive phenology and success, but responses are not uniform across species. Moreover, traits associated with resource acquisition, such as rooting depth and life history (early vs. late flowering), mediate plant phenology, and reproductive responses to changing climatic conditions. Specifically, we found that warming delayed the reproductive phenology and decreased number of inflorescences of Kobresia pygmaea C. B. Clarke, a shallow-rooted, early-flowering plant, which may be mainly constrained by upper-soil moisture availability. Because K. pygmaea is the dominant species in the alpine meadow ecosystem, these results may have important implications for ecosystem dynamics and for pastoralists and wildlife in the region.","We thank The University Cooperation, Tibet‐Norway Network for providing funds for Mr. Tsechoe Dorji to conduct his studies.

Carbon accumulates because Sphagnum mosses slow microbial carbon decomposition processes, leading to the production of labile intermediate compounds. Acetate is a major product of Sphagnum degradation, yet rates of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis far exceed rates of aceticlastic methanogenesis, suggesting that alternative acetate mineralization processes exist. Two possible explanations are aerobic respiration and anaerobic respiration via humic acids as electron acceptors. While these processes have been widely observed, microbial community interactions linking Sphagnum degradation and acetate mineralization remain cryptic. In this work, we use ordination and network analysis of functional genes from 110 globally distributed peatland metagenomes to identify conserved metabolic pathways in Sphagnum bogs. We then use metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from McLean Bog, a Sphagnum bog in New York State, as a local case study to reconstruct pathways of Sphagnum degradation and acetate mineralization. We describe metabolically flexible Acidobacteriota MAGs that contain all genes to completely degrade Sphagnum cell wall sugars under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Finally, we propose a hypothetical model of acetate oxidation driven by changes in peat redox potential that explain how bogs may circumvent aceticlastic methanogenesis through aerobic and humics-driven respiration.","The authors would like to thank Tamar Barkay, Hinsby Cadillo-Quiroz, and Janet Jansson for their permission to include their unpublished metagenomes in this study.

A gradient of consumer removal was maintained long enough to allow the abundances of both consumer and prey (phytoplankton) to equilibrate to the manipulation. Strong and unequivocal nonlinearities were found in the effect of Daphnia on total phytoplankton abundance and the abundance of most of the common phytoplankton species. Daphnia's suppression of phytoplankton was strong between 0 and approximately 400 microg Daphnia L(-1) but essentially nil from approximately 400 to 900 microg Daphnia L(-1). The sharp deceleration in Daphnia's effect was not caused by a shift within the phytoplankton community toward consumption-resistant forms. The most likely explanation for the deceleration was a reduction in Daphnia's filtering effort at low phytoplankton abundance, that is, a Type III functional response. A review of experimental literature suggested that decelerating effects of consumers are the norm in aquatic systems. Nonlinear effects present problems for the estimation of interaction strength and the building of community interaction models from the results of predator manipulations. It is suggested that the role of field experiments in community ecology should be to test rather than to parameterize models.",,,The American Naturalist,,University of Chicago Press,"0003-0147, 1537-5323","Animals; Daphnia; Ecosystem; Models, Biological; Phytoplankton; Population Density; Predatory Behavior; Time Factors",2003-03-07,2003,2003-03-07,2003-03,161,3,478-96,Closed,Article,"Sarnelle, Orlando","Sarnelle, Orlando (Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824, USA. sarnelle@msu.edu)",,"Sarnelle, Orlando (Michigan State University)",Michigan State University,grid.17088.36,East Lansing,Michigan,United States,,,,,,25,1,0.24,1.72,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1058662800,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,A05 Biological Sciences,

To reverse the adverse effects of modified freshwater flow, adequate management of discharge is required, especially due to higher water requirements and abstractions for human use. Here, we look at the effects of anthropogenically controlled freshwater flow regimes on the planktonic food web of a Ramsar listed coastal lagoon that is under recovery from degradation. Our results show shifts in water quality and plankton community interactions associated to changes in water flow. These shifts in food web interactions represent modifications in habitat complexity and water quality. At high flow, phytoplankton-zooplankton interactions dominate the food web. Conversely, at low flow, bacteria, viruses and nano/picoplankton interactions are more dominant, with a substantial switch of the food web towards heterotrophy. This switch can be associated with excess organic matter loading, decomposition of dead organisms, and synergistic and antagonistic interactions. We suggest that a lower variability in flow amplitude could be beneficial for the long-term sustaining of water quality and food web interactions, while improving the ecosystem health of systems facing similar stresses as the Coorong.","Funding was supported by the Australian Research Council (DP110101679) and by the Scholarship of Deevesh Hemraj from the National Centre of Excellence in Desalination Australia.

Such eco-evolutionary processes may be most readily explored in systems with short generations and simple genetics. Asexual and cyclically parthenogenetic organisms such as microalgae, cladocerans and rotifers, which frequently dominate freshwater plankton communities, meet these requirements. Multiple clonal lines can coexist within each species over extended periods, until either fixation occurs or a sexual phase reshuffles the genetic material. When clones differ in traits affecting interspecific interactions, within-species clonal dynamics can have major effects on the population dynamics. We first consider a simple predator-prey system with two prey genotypes, parametrized with data from a well-studied experimental system, and explore how the extent of differences in defence against predation within the prey population determine dynamic stability versus instability of the system. We then explore how increased potential for evolution affects the community dynamics in a more general community model with multiple predator and multiple prey genotypes. These examples illustrate how microevolutionary 'details' that enhance or limit the potential for heritable phenotypic change can have significant effects on contemporaneous community-level dynamics and the persistence and coexistence of species.","Our research has been supported primarily by the Andrew W.

Interspecific competition influences which, how many and where species coexist in biological communities. Interactions between species in different trophic levels can mediate interspecific competition; e.g. predators are known to reduce competition between prey species by suppressing their population sizes. A parallel phenomenon may take place in host-parasite systems, with host defence mediating competition between parasite species. 2. We experimentally investigated the impact of host defence (preening) on competitive interactions between two species of feather-feeding lice: 'wing' lice Columbicola columbae and 'body' lice Campanulotes compar. Both species are host-specific parasites that co-occur on rock pigeons Columba livia. 3. We show that wing lice and body lice compete and that host defence mediates the magnitude of this competitive interaction. 4. Competition is asymmetrical; wing louse populations are negatively impacted by body lice, but not vice versa. This competitive asymmetry is consistent with the fact that body lice predominate in microhabitats on the host's body that offer the most food and the most space. 5. Our results indicate that host-defence-mediated competition can influence the structure of parasite communities and may play a part in the evolution of parasite diversity.","We are grateful to F.

In this work, microbial functional molecular ecological networks were studied in both contaminated and uncontaminated soils to determine the possible influences of oil contamination on microbial interactions and potential functions. Soil samples were obtained from an oil-exploring site located in South China, and the microbial functional genes were analyzed with GeoChip, a high-throughput functional microarray. By building random networks based on null model, we demonstrated that overall network structures and properties were significantly different between contaminated and uncontaminated soils (P < 0.001). Network connectivity, module numbers, and modularity were all reduced with contamination. Moreover, the topological roles of the genes (module hub and connectors) were altered with oil contamination. Subnetworks of genes involved in alkane and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degradation were also constructed. Negative co-occurrence patterns prevailed among functional genes, thereby indicating probable competition relationships. The potential ""keystone"" genes, defined as either ""hubs"" or genes with highest connectivities in the network, were further identified.

For the study of interspecific interactions, molecular gut-content analysis enables detection of arthropod predation with minimal disruption of community interactions. Field experiments have demonstrated that standard mass-collection methods, such as sweep netting, vacuum sampling and foliage beating, sometimes lead to contamination of predators with nontarget DNA, thereby compromising resultant gut-content data. We deliberately contaminated immature Coleomegilla maculata and Podisus maculiventris that had been fed larvae of Leptinotarsa decemlineata by topically applying homogenate of the alternate prey Leptinotarsa juncta. We then attempted to remove contaminating DNA by washing in ethanol or bleach. A 40-min wash with end-over-end rotation in 80% EtOH did not reliably reduce external DNA contamination. Identical treatment with 2.5% commercial bleach removed most externally contaminating DNA without affecting the detectability of the target prey DNA in the gut. Use of this bleaching protocol, perhaps with minor modifications tailored to different predator-prey systems, should reliably eliminate external DNA contamination, thereby alleviating concerns about this possible source of cross-contamination for mass-collected arthropod predators destined for molecular gut-content analysis.","We thank Michael Athanas, Eddie Bender, James Smith and Meiling Webb for rearing insects; and Robert Harrison, James Harwood, Zsofia Szendrei and three anonymous reviewers for thorough and thoughtful comments on the manuscript.",,Molecular Ecology Resources,,Wiley,"1755-098X, 1755-0998","Animals; Coleoptera; DNA; DNA Contamination; Gastrointestinal Contents; Heteroptera; Molecular Sequence Data; Predatory Behavior; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Specimen Handling",2012-01-24,2012,2012-01-24,2012-05,12,3,464-469,Closed,Article,"GREENSTONE, MATTHEW H.; WEBER, DONALD C.; COUDRON, THOMAS A.; PAYTON, MARK E.; HU, JING S.","GREENSTONE, MATTHEW H.

The photobioreactor cultivations were conducted using tap water-based media to introduce background bacterial population. Growth of algae was monitored over time with three independent methods. Additionally, the quantity and quality of eukaryotes and bacteria were analysed using culture-independent molecular tools based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR). Static mixers used in the flat plate photobioreactors did not generally enhance the growth at the low light intensities used. The maximum biomass concentration and maximum specific growth rate were 1.0 g l(-1) and 2.0 day(-1) respectively. Bacterial growth as determined by QPCR was associated with the growth of C. vulgaris. Based on PCR-DGGE, bacteria in the cultures mainly originated from the tap water. Bacterial community profiles were diverse but reproducible in all flat plate cultures. Most prominent bacteria in the C. vulgaris cultures belonged to the class Alphaproteobacteria and especially to the genus Sphingomonas. Analysis of the diversity of non-photosynthetic microorganisms in algal mass cultures can provide useful information on the public health aspects and unravel community interactions.","We thank Pertti Vuoriranta for his input to the reactor designs.

Corridors are thought to increase the exchange of individuals between habitat patches, promoting genetic exchange and reducing population fluctuations. Empirical studies addressing the effects of corridors have either been small in scale or have ignored confounding effects of increased habitat area created by the presence of a corridor. These methodological difficulties, coupled with a paucity of studies examining the effects of corridors on plants and plant-animal interactions, have sparked debate over the purported value of corridors in conservation planning. We report results of a large-scale experiment that directly address this debate. In eight large-scale experimental landscapes that control for patch area and test alternative mechanisms of corridor function, we demonstrate that corridors not only increase the exchange of animals between patches, but also facilitate two key plant-animal interactions: pollination and seed dispersal. Our results show that the beneficial effects of corridors extend beyond the area they add, and suggest that increased plant and animal movement through corridors will have positive impacts on plant populations and community interactions in fragmented landscapes.","We extend special thanks to John Blake, Ed Olson, and other Forest Service colleagues for logistical support and encouragement; C.

Before the evolution and proliferation of oxygenic photosynthesis, biological production in the ferruginous oceans was likely driven by photoferrotrophic bacteria that oxidize ferrous iron {Fe(II)} to harness energy from sunlight and fix inorganic carbon into biomass. Photoferrotrophs may thus have fuelled Earth’s early biosphere providing energy to drive microbial growth and evolution over billions of years. Yet, photoferrotrophic activity has remained largely elusive on the modern Earth, leaving models for early biological production untested and imperative ecological context for the evolution of life missing. Here, we show that an active community of pelagic photoferrotrophs comprises up to 30% of the total microbial community in illuminated ferruginous waters of Kabuno Bay (KB), East Africa (DR Congo). These photoferrotrophs produce oxidized iron {Fe(III)} and biomass and support a diverse pelagic microbial community including heterotrophic Fe(III)-reducers, sulfate reducers, fermenters and methanogens. At modest light levels, rates of photoferrotrophy in KB exceed those predicted for early Earth primary production and are sufficient to generate Earth’s largest sedimentary iron ore deposits. Fe cycling, however, is efficient and complex microbial community interactions likely regulate Fe(III) and organic matter export from the photic zone.","The authors thank Georges Alunga, Pascal Masilya, Pascal Mwapu Ishumbisho, Boniface Kaningini, Charles Balagizi, Katcho Karume, Mathieu Yalire, Djoba, Silas, Laetitia Nyinawamwiza, Bruno Leporcq, Adriana Anzil, Marc-Vincent Commarieu, Fleur A E Roland, Laetitia Montante, Alexander Treusch and Niko Finke for help with laboratory and field work.

For most of these therapies, the recipients are not given antibiotics to eliminate the microbial community prior to transplant with donor fecal microbes resulting in the initial gut microbial community following FMT consisting of a consortium of donor and recipient microbes. The detailed analysis of the fecal samples from these FMT over time provides a unique opportunity to study the changes in the gut microbial strain community that occurs following the introduction of new microbial strains (donor) into an established community (recipient).
METHODS: In this study, we have metagenomic data set consisting of 5 FMT that contained donor, recipient and recipient post FMT taken multiple times for periods up to 535 days after the FMT. We used two established strain tracking methods, Window-based Single Nucleotide Variant (SNV) Similarity (WSS) and StrainPhlAn, to determine the presence of donor and recipient microbial strains following FMT. To assess recombination between donor and recipient strains of Bacteroides vulgatus post FMT, we used BLAST+ to analyze the data sets for Bacteroidales-specific antimicrobial proteins (BSAP-3) that have known functions to restrict species specific replication.
RESULTS: We found that Alistipes onderdonkii, Alistipes shahii, Alistipes putredinis, and Parabacteroides merdae, all had patterns post FMT consisting of either dominant donor or recipient microbial strains in the feces. In contrast, the analysis of Bacteroides spp. in five FMT pairs revealed inter-individual oscillation over time with the appearance of either donor or recipient fecal strain dominance. In some instances, B. vulgatus and B. uniformis were also identified after FMT that were not related to either the donor or recipient. Finally, in one of the FMT, we identified a distinct B. vulgatus strain post-FMT that matched the pre-FMT strain but was BSAP-3 positive, suggesting a possible recombination event between the donor and recipient strains.
CONCLUSION: The complex oscillating patterns of the appearance of fecal dominant donor, recipient or unrelated strains following extended times post FMT provide new insights into the dynamics of the microbial community interactions with the recipients following FMT. The result from our analysis has implications for the use of FMT to predictably change the biological functions of the gut community in metabolism and host immunity.",We thank the UAB Information Technology Research Computing group for providing the high-performance computing support necessary for bioinformatics analyses.

Model microbial communities constructed with genetically tractable strains known to interact in natural settings can untangle these networks and reveal underpinning mechanisms. Our model system, The Hitchhikers of the Rhizosphere (THOR), is composed of three species-Bacillus cereus, Flavobacterium johnsoniae, and Pseudomonas koreensis-that co-isolate from field-grown soybean roots. Comparative metatranscriptomics on THOR revealed global patterns of interspecies transcriptional regulation. When grown in pairs, each member of THOR exhibits unique signaling behavior. In the community setting, gene expression is dominated by pairwise interactions with Pseudomonas koreensis mediated either directly or indirectly by its production of the antibiotic koreenceine-the apparent ""hammer"" of THOR. In pairwise interactions, the koreenceine biosynthetic cluster is responsible for 85 and 22% of differentially regulated genes in F. johnsoniae and B. cereus, respectively. Although both deletion of the koreenceine locus and reduction of P. koreensis inoculum size increase F. johnsoniae populations, the transcriptional response of P. koreensis is only activated when it is a relative minority member at the beginning of coculture. The largest group of upregulated P. koreensis genes in response to F. johnsoniae are those without functional annotation, indicating that focusing on genes important for community interactions may offer a path toward functional assignments for unannotated genes. This study illustrates the power of comparative metatranscriptomics of microorganisms encountering increasing microbial complexity for understanding community signal integration, antibiotic responses, and interspecies communication. IMPORTANCE The diversity, ubiquity, and significance of microbial communities is clear. However, the predictable and reliable manipulation of microbiomes to impact human, environmental, and agricultural health remains a challenge. Effective remodeling of microbiomes will be enabled by understanding the interspecies interactions that govern community processes. The extreme complexity of most microbiomes has impeded characterization of the relevant interactions. Investigating the genetics and biochemistry of simplified, model microbiomes could unearth specific interactions and generate predictions about community-governing principles. Here, we use one such model community to quantify changes in gene expression of individual species as they encounter stimuli from one or more species, directly mapping combinatorial interspecies interactions. A surprising amount of gene expression is regulated by a single molecule, the antibiotic koreenceine, which appears to impact gene regulation across community networks.",This study was supported by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory and the U.S. Army Research Office under contract/grant W911NF1910269.

However, the ecological and behavioral diversity of vertebrate predators of southern California kelp forests limits our ability to make general conclusions about MPA effectiveness across a variety of species. Identifying and studying species with extreme feeding habits or prey-capture strategies may offer greater insight into predator-prey relationships and reveal the trophic importance of an animal in the larger community. Moray eels (family Muraenidae) have been shown to have morphological and behavioral adaptations that allow them to consume large prey whole, identifying them as important predators. From 2015 to 2018, we studied the health and feeding behavior of a long-lived, elusive, and benthic kelp forest predator, the California moray eel (Gymnothorax mordax). We trapped eels inside and outside of Blue Cavern Onshore State Marine Conservation Area, an MPA on the northwest side of Santa Catalina Island, CA which prohibits the take of any species. Over 4 years, we captured 1736 eels. Overall, we found that morays were longer, older, heavier, had higher body condition, and were found in greater abundance within the MPA. Although fish comprised the majority of their summer diet, morays outside of the MPA were consuming a more diverse set of fish, while kelp bass comprised more than half of the diet for morays inhabiting the MPA. Additionally, we found that morays within the MPA had larger relative vertical gape distances (VGDs) and narrower heads. Our recapture data support the high site fidelity of morays, indicating that their diet and morphology are influenced by their local community. While the majority of morays are thriving in the MPA, as suggested by their robust sizes and longevity, high abundance appears to result in higher frequencies of cannibalism, the presence of an undescribed disease, and lower growth rates. Our results suggest that the MPA affects the life history of morays and may select for an alternative feeding strategy in which eels develop larger VGDs, smaller adductor muscles, and a specialized diet which is presumably influenced by the local environment. In addition, observations of cannibalistic behavior and species-specific disease provide us with important insight into natural factors that may still regulate populations removed from anthropogenic disturbances such as fishing.",,,Integrative and Comparative Biology,,Oxford University Press (OUP),"1540-7063, 1557-7023","Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; California; Conservation of Natural Resources; Eels; Predatory Behavior",2020-06-12,2020,2020-06-12,2020-08-01,60,2,522-534,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Mehta, Rita S; Dale, Katherine E; Higgins, Benjamin A","Mehta, Rita S (Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, 130 McAllister Way, Santa Cruz, CA 95060, USA.); Dale, Katherine E (Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, 130 McAllister Way, Santa Cruz, CA 95060, USA.); Higgins, Benjamin A (Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, 130 McAllister Way, Santa Cruz, CA 95060, USA.)",,"Mehta, Rita S (University of California, Santa Cruz); Dale, Katherine E (University of California, Santa Cruz); Higgins, Benjamin A (University of California, Santa Cruz)","University of California, Santa Cruz",grid.205975.c,Santa Cruz,California,United States,National Science Foundation; Hellman Foundation,NSF - National Science Foundation; US Federal Funders,United States; United States,,,3,3,0.15,0.95,6,https://academic.oup.com/icb/article-pdf/60/2/522/33875348/icaa061.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128105040,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,A05 Biological Sciences; B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,14 Life Below Water; 15 Life on Land

As with any quantitative estimation technique, qSIP involves measurement error, and a fuller understanding of error, precision, and statistical power benefits qSIP experimental design and data interpretation. We used several qSIP data sets-from soil and seawater microbiomes-to evaluate how variance in isotope incorporation estimates depends on organism abundance and resolution of the density fractionation scheme. We assessed statistical power for replicated qSIP studies, plus sensitivity and specificity for unreplicated designs. As a taxon's abundance increases, the variance of its weighted mean density declines. Nine fractions appear to be a reasonable trade-off between cost and precision for most qSIP applications. Increasing the number of density fractions beyond that reduces variance, although the magnitude of this benefit declines with additional fractions. Our analysis suggests that, if a taxon has an isotope enrichment of 10 atom% excess, there is a 60% chance that this will be detected as significantly different from zero (with alpha 0.1). With five replicates, isotope enrichment of 5 atom% could be detected with power (0.6) and alpha (0.1). Finally, we illustrate the importance of internal standards, which can help to calibrate per sample conversions of %GC to mean weighted density. These results should benefit researchers designing future SIP experiments and provide a useful reference for metagenomic SIP applications where both financial and computational limitations constrain experimental scope.IMPORTANCE One of the biggest challenges in microbial ecology is correlating the identity of microorganisms with the roles they fulfill in natural environmental systems. Studies of microbes in pure culture reveal much about their genomic content and potential functions but may not reflect an organism's activity within its natural community. Culture-independent studies supply a community-wide view of composition and function in the context of community interactions but often fail to link the two. Quantitative stable isotope probing (qSIP) is a method that can link the identity and functional activity of specific microbes within a naturally occurring community. Here, we explore how the resolution of density gradient fractionation affects the error and precision of qSIP results, how they may be improved via additional experimental replication, and discuss cost-benefit balanced scenarios for SIP experimental design.","We thank the SPRUCE team, Michaela Hayer, Paul Dijkstra, Sheryl Bell, and Ember Morrissey for generously providing data and Andy Tomatsu at the DOE Joint Genome Institute for operating the high-throughput SIP pipeline for the mock communities.

Shale formations underly much of the continental USA and display geographically distinct gradients in temperature and salinity. Complementing studies performed in eastern USA shales that contain brine-like fluids, here we coupled metagenomic and metabolomic approaches to develop the first genome-level insights into ecosystem colonization and microbial community interactions in a lower-salinity, but high-temperature western USA shale formation.ResultsWe collected materials used during the hydraulic fracturing process (i.e., chemicals, drill muds) paired with temporal sampling of water produced from three different hydraulically fractured wells in the STACK (Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin, Canadian and Kingfisher) shale play in OK, USA. Relative to other shale formations, our metagenomic and metabolomic analyses revealed an expanded taxonomic and metabolic diversity of microorganisms that colonize and persist in fractured shales. Importantly, temporal sampling across all three hydraulic fracturing wells traced the degradation of complex polymers from the hydraulic fracturing process to the production and consumption of organic acids that support sulfate- and thiosulfate-reducing bacteria. Furthermore, we identified 5587 viral genomes and linked many of these to the dominant, colonizing microorganisms, demonstrating the key role that viral predation plays in community dynamics within this closed, engineered system. Lastly, top-side audit sampling of different source materials enabled genome-resolved source tracking, revealing the likely sources of many key colonizing and persisting taxa in these ecosystems.ConclusionsThese findings highlight the importance of resource utilization and resistance to viral predation as key traits that enable specific microbial taxa to persist across fractured shale ecosystems. We also demonstrate the importance of materials used in the hydraulic fracturing process as both a source of persisting shale microorganisms and organic substrates that likely aid in sustaining the microbial community. Moreover, we showed that different physicochemical conditions (i.e., salinity, temperature) can influence the composition and functional potential of persisting microbial communities in shale ecosystems. Together, these results expand our knowledge of microbial life in deep subsurface shales and have important ramifications for management and treatment of microbial biomass in hydraulically fractured wells.FLC2hWdvCQdk4dv7tGhc3oVideo Abstract","NMR metabolomic analyses and a portion of the sequencing were performed under the Facilities Integrating Collaborations for User Science (FICUS) initiative and used resources at the US Department of Energy (DOE) Joint Genome Institute (proposal ID 1931) and the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (proposal ID 49615), which are DOE Office of Science User Facilities.

These actively venting deep-sea hydrothermal deposits support a rich diversity of thermophilic microorganisms which are involved in a range of carbon, sulfur, nitrogen, and hydrogen metabolisms. Global patterns of thermophilic microbial diversity in deep-sea hydrothermal ecosystems have illustrated the strong connectivity between geological processes and microbial colonization, but little is known about the genomic diversity and physiological potential of these novel taxa. Here we explore this genomic diversity in 42 metagenomes from four deep-sea hydrothermal vent fields and a deep-sea volcano collected from 2004 to 2018 and document their potential implications in biogeochemical cycles.ResultsOur dataset represents 3635 metagenome-assembled genomes encompassing 511 novel and recently identified genera from deep-sea hydrothermal settings. Some of the novel bacterial (107) and archaeal genera (30) that were recently reported from the deep-sea Brothers volcano were also detected at the deep-sea hydrothermal vent fields, while 99 bacterial and 54 archaeal genera were endemic to the deep-sea Brothers volcano deposits. We report some of the first examples of medium- (≥ 50% complete, ≤ 10% contaminated) to high-quality (> 90% complete, < 5% contaminated) MAGs from phyla and families never previously identified, or poorly sampled, from deep-sea hydrothermal environments. We greatly expand the novel diversity of Thermoproteia, Patescibacteria (Candidate Phyla Radiation, CPR), and Chloroflexota found at deep-sea hydrothermal vents and identify a small sampling of two potentially novel phyla, designated JALSQH01 and JALWCF01. Metabolic pathway analysis of metagenomes provides insights into the prevalent carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and hydrogen metabolic processes across all sites and illustrates sulfur and nitrogen metabolic “handoffs” in community interactions. We confirm that Campylobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria occupy similar ecological guilds but their prevalence in a particular site is driven by shifts in the geochemical environment.ConclusionOur study of globally distributed hydrothermal vent deposits provides a significant expansion of microbial genomic diversity associated with hydrothermal vent deposits and highlights the metabolic adaptation of taxonomic guilds. Collectively, our results illustrate the importance of comparative biodiversity studies in establishing patterns of shared phylogenetic diversity and physiological ecology, while providing many targets for enrichment and cultivation of novel and endemic taxa.6aUVBDbDZ6m8Eohc79dCDgVideo Abstract","We thank the crew of the R/V Roger Revelle, R/V Atlantis, R/V Thomas G.

Despite the wide distribution of the marine benthic group E archaea (referred to as Hydrothermarchaeota) in the hydrothermal environment, little is known about their genomic repertoires and biogeochemical significance. Here, we studied four highly complete (>80%) metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from a black smoker chimney and the surrounding sulfur-rich sediments on the South Atlantic Mid-Ocean Ridge and publicly available data sets (the Integrated Microbial Genomes system of the U.S. Department of Energy-Joint Genome Institute and NCBI SRA data sets). Genomic analysis suggested a wide carbon metabolic diversity of Hydrothermarchaeota members, including the utilization of proteins, lactate, and acetate; the anaerobic degradation of aromatics; the oxidation of C1 compounds (CO, formate, and formaldehyde); the utilization of methyl compounds; CO2 incorporation by the tetrahydromethanopterin-based Wood-Ljungdahl pathway; and participation in the type III ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase-based Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. These microbes also potentially oxidize sulfur, arsenic, and hydrogen and engage in anaerobic respiration based on sulfate reduction and denitrification. Among the 140 MAGs reconstructed from the black smoker chimney microbial community (including Hydrothermarchaeota MAGs), community-level metabolic predictions suggested a redundancy of carbon utilization and element cycling functions and interactive syntrophic and sequential utilization of substrates. These processes might make various carbon and energy sources widely accessible to the microorganisms. Further, the analysis suggested that Hydrothermarchaeota members contained important functional components obtained from the community via lateral gene transfer, becoming a distinctive clade. This might serve as a niche-adaptive strategy for metabolizing heavy metals, C1 compounds, and reduced sulfur compounds. Collectively, the analysis provides comprehensive metabolic insights into the Hydrothermarchaeota IMPORTANCE This study provides comprehensive metabolic insights into the Hydrothermarchaeota from comparative genomics, evolution, and community-level perspectives. Members of the Hydrothermarchaeota synergistically participate in a wide range of carbon-utilizing and element cycling processes with other microorganisms in the community. We expand the current understanding of community interactions within the hydrothermal sediment and chimney, suggesting that microbial interactions based on sequential substrate metabolism are essential to nutrient and element cycling.","We thank all the DY125-26 cruise crew members who participated in the sampling of the deep-ocean sediments.

One of the process control elements is the regulatory role of hydrogen (H2). Reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) by H2 is rate limiting factor in methanogenesis, but the community intends to keep H2 concentration low in order to maintain the redox balance of the overall system. H2 metabolism in methanogens becomes increasingly important in the Power-to-Gas renewable energy conversion and storage technologies.ResultsThe early response of the mixed mesophilic microbial community to H2 gas injection was investigated with the goal of uncovering the first responses of the microbial community in the CH4 formation and CO2 mitigation Power-to-Gas process. The overall microbial composition changes, following a 10 min excessive bubbling of H2 through the reactor, was investigated via metagenome and metatranscriptome sequencing. The overall composition and taxonomic abundance of the biogas producing anaerobic community did not change appreciably 2 hours after the H2 treatment, indicating that this time period was too short to display differences in the proliferation of the members of the microbial community. There was, however, a substantial increase in the expression of genes related to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis of certain groups of Archaea. As an early response to H2 exposure the activity of the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in the genus Methanoculleus was upregulated but the hydrogenotrophic pathway in genus Methanosarcina was downregulated. The RT-qPCR data corroborated the metatranscriptomicResultsH2 injection also altered the metabolism of a number of microbes belonging in the kingdom Bacteria. Many Bacteria possess the enzyme sets for the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. These and the homoacetogens are partners for syntrophic community interactions between the distinct kingdoms of Archaea and Bacteria.ConclusionsExternal H2 regulates the functional activity of certain Bacteria and Archaea. The syntrophic cross-kingdom interactions in H2 metabolism are important for the efficient operation of the Power-to-Gas process. Therefore, mixed communities are recommended for the large scale Power-to-Gas process rather than single hydrogenotrophic methanogen strains. Fast and reproducible response from the microbial community can be exploited in turn-off and turn-on of the Power-to-Gas microbial cell factories.","ZB acknowledges the funding of Hungarian NKFIH/OTKA program, project number FK 123902.

In the absence of direct predation, nonconsumptive effects of predators on prey have important implications for subsequent community interactions. To better understand these interactions, we used a Daphnia-parasite-predator cue system to evaluate if predation risk affects Daphnia responses to a parasite. We investigated the effects of predator cues on two aspects of host-parasite interactions (susceptibility to infection and infection intensity), and whether or not these effects differed between sexes. Our results show that changes in response to predator cues caused an increase in the prevalence and intensity of parasite infections in female predator-exposed Daphnia. Importantly, the magnitude of infection risk depended on how long Daphnia were exposed to the cues. Additionally, heavily infected Daphnia that were constantly exposed to cues produced relatively more offspring. While males were ~5× less likely to become infected compared to females, we were unable to detect effects of predator cues on male Daphnia-parasite interactions. In sum, predators, prey, and their parasites can form complex subnetworks in food webs, necessitating a nuanced understanding of how nonconsumptive effects may mediate these interactions.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We would like to thank the staff at Koffler Scientific Reserve for assistance obtaining Chaoborus, Dieter Ebert and Jürgen Hottinger for the provision of Daphnia and parasite material, and Pepijn Luijckx for assistance setting up the Daphnia–Ordospora system.

However, the knowledge on microbe-microbe interactions in response to vegetation changes is scarce. In this study, we investigated how bacterial and fungal community composition, as well as bacterial-fungal community interactions, altered along a vegetation gradient in the Poyang Lake wetland. Surface soil and sediment samples were collected from three vegetation zones: dense, sparse, and naked. Vegetation zones differed in terms of dominant plant species, plant diversity, and vegetation coverage. Using Illumina MiSeq sequencing and network analysis of bacteria 16S rRNA and fungal ITS genes, we found that both bacterial and fungal community profiles varied according to vegetation conditions; in particular, the dense vegetation zone facilitated higher microbial abundance and a greater fungi to bacteria ratio. Co-occurrence analysis revealed that fungi-bacteria interactions were strong on vegetated zones, especially in the dense vegetation zone. However, a weak fungi-bacteria association was observed in the naked zone. Our results indicated that aboveground vegetation may act as a hotspot for organic matter accumulation, microbial growth, and microbe-microbe interactions, whereas fungi and bacteria prefer to distribute into niches based on their own nutritional preferences and functional specificity in bare ground.","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grants 31360127, 31660149, and 41601337), the Open Foundation of MOE Key Laboratory of Poyang Lake Environment and Resource (grant PYH2015-13), and a Nanchang University Seed Grant for Biomedicine (9202-0210210807).

Sixty-four lambs with similarity body weight were randomly assigned to four groups after weaning off ewe’s milk on the 17th day (6.2 ± 0.2 kg). The lambs of the control group (CON) were fed a basal diet, and the other three groups were subjected to a diet of decreased protein (PR), digestible energy (ER) or both of them at 20% (BR) of basal diet. The decrease of dietary protein or energy level decreased the average daily gain, ruminal weight and mucosal thickness of lambs (P < 0.05). The total volatile fatty acid (TVFA), acetate and propionate concentration of the CON group were significantly higher than that of the other three groups. The dietary protein and energy level affected the microbial diversity, and low energy level increased the relative abundance of phyla of Fibrobacteres, whereas at the genus level, increased the relative abundance of Butyrivibrio and Prevotellaceae. Under different dietary energy and protein levels, 14 genera exhibited significant correlation with ruminal fermentation. These findings supplied new perspective for the understanding of the dietary effect on ruminal microbial community interactions and are of great significance for establishing the optimal nutrient supply strategy for lambs.","The National Key R&amp;D Program of China (2018YFD0502104) supported this research.

However, recent findings indicate that organic compounds can interact within microbial metabolisms. The relevance of interactive effects within marine systems is debated and a mechanistic understanding of its complexities, including microbe-substrate relationships, is lacking. As a first step toward uncovering mediating processes, the interactive effects of distinct pools of OM on the growth and respiration of marine bacteria, individual strains and a simple, constructed community of Roseobacter lineage members were tested. Isolates were provided with natural organic matter (NOM) and different concentrations (1, 4, 40, 400 μM-C) and forms of labile OM (acetate, casamino acids, tryptone, coumarate). The microbial response to the mixed substrate regimes was assessed using viable counts and respiration in two separate experiments. Two marine bacteria and a six-member constructed community were assayed with these experiments. Both synergistic and antagonistic growth responses were evident for all strains, but all were transient. The specific substrate conditions promoting a response, and the direction of that response, varied amongst species. These findings indicate that the substrate conditions that result in OM interactive effects are both transient and species-specific and thus influenced by both the composition and metabolic potential of a microbial community.",We thank Terry Hazen for the use of the respirometer and Melanie Mayes and Hannah Woo for training on the instrument.,Funding.

1389,pub.1105743435,10.1038/s41559-018-0622-3,30061563,,,Frequency-dependent feedback constrains plant community coexistence,"Ecological theory suggests that coexistence of many species within communities requires negative frequency-dependent feedbacks to prevent exclusion of the least fit species. For plant communities, empirical evidence of negative frequency dependence driving species coexistence and diversity patterns is rapidly accumulating, but connecting these findings to theory has been difficult as corresponding theoretical frameworks only consider small numbers of species. Here, we show how frequency-dependent feedback constrains community coexistence, regardless of the number of species and inherent fitness inequalities between them. Any interaction network can be characterized by a single community interaction coefficient, IC, which determines whether community-level feedback is positive or negative. Negative feedback is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for persistence of the entire community. Even in cases where the coexistence equilibrium state cannot recover from perturbations, IC < 0 can enable species persistence via cyclic succession. The number of coexisting species is predicted to increase with the average strength of negative feedback. This prediction is supported by patterns of tree species diversity in more than 200,000 deciduous forest plots in the eastern United States, which can be reproduced in simulations that span the observed range of community feedback. By providing a quantitative metric for the strength of negative feedback needed for coexistence, we can now integrate theory and empirical data to test whether observed feedback–diversity correlations are strong enough to infer causality.","This work was conducted as part of the ‘Plant–soil feedback theory’ Working Group at the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis, sponsored by the National Science Foundation through NSF Award DBI-1300426, with additional support from The University of Tennessee, Knoxville.

Ant-mediated seed dispersal fails in the wettest habitat of deciduous forest in eastern North America, and we examine whether this pattern  corresponds with colony distributions for seed-dispersing ants and associated heterogeneity in abiotic and biotic variables. Specifically, we used spatial variation in soil moisture, temperature and diffuse light along natural habitat gradients and experimentally manipulated soil moisture  gradients to examine ant habitat selection. We also examined niche segregation between effective (Aphaenogaster spp.) and ineffective (Lasius alienus Foerster) seed-dispersing ants across these environmental gradients. Whereas most research links ant foraging and nesting with temperature gradients,  we find niche segregation between Aphaenogaster spp. and L. alienus by soil moisture along naturally occurring gradients and in experimentally irrigated upland habitat. The failure of Aphaenogaster spp. to occupy the wettest habitats, where L. alienus is present, is consistent with observed  seed dispersal failure in these habitats. These results indicate that environmental heterogeneity drives niche segregation between effective (Aphaenogaster spp.) and ineffective (L. alienus) seed dispersers so each occupies distinct habitat. Most forest understory plants rely on ants for seed  dispersal. Our research implies that climate-mediated interactions between effective and ineffective seed dispersing ant species may structure the microhabitat distributions for woodland herbs.",We thank Joshua King and Neil McCoy for advice on nest box construction and Jim Affolter and the State Botanical Garden of Georgia for site access.

In Fennoscandia, changes in climate and human land use are assumed to alter the dynamics of cyclic small rodents (main prey) and lead to increased densities and range expansion of an important generalist predator, the red fox Vulpes vulpes. In order to better understand the role of these potential changes in community structure on an alternative prey species, willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus, we analyzed nine years of population census data from SE Norway to investigate how community interactions affected their population dynamics. The ptarmigan populations showed no declining trend during the study period, and annual variations corresponded with marked periodic small rodent peaks and declines. Population growth and breeding success were highly correlated, and both demographic variables were influenced by an interaction between red fox and small rodents. Red foxes affected ptarmigan negatively only when small rodent abundance was low, which is in accordance with the alternative prey hypothesis. Our results confirm the important role of red fox predation in ptarmigan dynamics, and indicate that if small rodent cycles are disrupted, this may lead to decline in ptarmigan and other alternative prey species due to elevated predation pressure.","The Research Council of Norway funded JIB and this study with grant number 210140, www.forskningsradet.no.

We investigated the microbial community composition and succession in coastal marine biofilms on plastic. Samples were collected over 75 days of immersion with strengthened samplings during the early stages of biofilm establishment. Biofilm composition was estimated using Illumina Miseq and microbial community interactions were assessed through microbial association network analysis. In silico analyses showed that primers used in most of previous studies considerably underestimated marine biofilm diversity. Unintentionally ignored so far, we showed that Flavobacteriia might be key actors in the functioning of marine biofilms. Gamma-proteobacteria from the genus Oleibacter strongly dominated microbial communities during the first hours of biofilm formation. These pioneer communities were quickly replaced by alpha-proteobacteria and Flavobacteriia. Bacterial communities exhibited fast temporal structure dynamics with taxa displaying rapid increases and declines. A total of 90% of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were intermittent or ephemeral reinforcing the conclusion that marine biofilms are highly dynamics. With 2/3 of positive significant connections between bacterial OTUs, microbial biofilm communities appear to be more inclined to develop inter-specific cooperation rather than competition and might thus form sets of functional guilds with mutual metabolic exchanges.",,,FEMS Microbiology Ecology,,Oxford University Press (OUP),"0168-6496, 1574-6941","Alphaproteobacteria; Bays; Biofilms; Flavobacteriaceae; France; Gammaproteobacteria; Microbial Consortia; Plastics; Polyvinyl Chloride; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Water Microbiology",2018-05-03,2018,2018-05-03,2018-06-01,94,6,,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Pollet, Thomas; Berdjeb, Lyria; Garnier, Cédric; Durrieu, Gaël; Le Poupon, Christophe; Misson, Benjamin; Jean-François, Briand","Pollet, Thomas (MAPIEM EA 4323, Université de Toulon, CS 60584, 83041 Toulon, Cedex 9, France.; UMR BIPAR, INRA, ANSES, ENVA, Université Paris-Est, Maisons-Alfort, France.); Berdjeb, Lyria (PROTEE, EA 3819, Université de Toulon, CS 60584, 83041 Toulon, France.); Garnier, Cédric (PROTEE, EA 3819, Université de Toulon, CS 60584, 83041 Toulon, France.); Durrieu, Gaël (PROTEE, EA 3819, Université de Toulon, CS 60584, 83041 Toulon, France.); Le Poupon, Christophe (PROTEE, EA 3819, Université de Toulon, CS 60584, 83041 Toulon, France.); Misson, Benjamin (PROTEE, EA 3819, Université de Toulon, CS 60584, 83041 Toulon, France.); Jean-François, Briand (MAPIEM EA 4323, Université de Toulon, CS 60584, 83041 Toulon, Cedex 9, France.)",,"Pollet, Thomas (Université de Toulon; French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety); Berdjeb, Lyria (Université de Toulon); Garnier, Cédric (Université de Toulon); Durrieu, Gaël (Université de Toulon); Le Poupon, Christophe (Université de Toulon); Misson, Benjamin (Université de Toulon); Jean-François, Briand (Université de Toulon)","Université de Toulon; French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety",grid.12611.35; grid.15540.35,La Garde; Maisons-Alfort,; ,France; France,,,,,,90,63,3.87,14.61,6,https://academic.oup.com/femsec/article-pdf/94/6/fiy083/28023766/fiy083.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1103798753,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3107 Microbiology,Infectious Diseases,Infection,,,,A05 Biological Sciences,14 Life Below Water

Complex methanogenesis pathways used by archaea are the main route for bioconversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to CH4 in nature2–4. Here, we report that wild-type iron-iron (Fe-only) nitrogenase from the bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris reduces CO2 simultaneously with nitrogen gas (N2) and protons to yield CH4, ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen gas (H2) in a single enzymatic step. The amount of CH4 produced by purified Fe-only nitrogenase was low compared to its other products, but CH4 production by this enzyme in R. palustris was sufficient to support the growth of an obligate CH4-utilizing Methylomonas strain when the two microorganisms were grown in co-culture, with oxygen (O2) added at intervals. Other nitrogen-fixing bacteria that we tested also formed CH4 when expressing Fe-only nitrogenase, suggesting that this is a general property of this enzyme. The genomes of 9% of diverse nitrogen-fixing microorganisms from a range of environments encode Fe-only nitrogenase. Our data suggest that active Fe-only nitrogenase, present in diverse microorganisms, contributes CH4 that could shape microbial community interactions.","We thank the entire Biological Electron Transfer and Catalysis (BETCy) team for informative discussions.

Using a wild tomato, Solanum peruvianum, native to the Peruvian Andes, we evaluated the disruption of pollination as a potential ecological cost of induced responses. More specifically, we tested the hypothesis that metabolic changes in herbivore-attacked plants, such as the herbivore-induced emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), alter pollinator behavior and consequentially affect plant fitness. We conducted a series of manipulative field experiments to evaluate the role of herbivore-induced vegetative and floral VOC emissions as mechanisms by which herbivory affects pollinator behavior. In field surveys and bioassays in the plants' native habitat, we found that real and simulated herbivory (methyl jasmonate application) reduced attractiveness of S. peruvianum flowers to their native pollinators. We show that reduced pollinator preference, not resource limitation due to leaf tissue removal, resulted in reduced seed set. Solitary bee pollinators use floral plant volatiles, emitted in response to herbivory or methyl jasmonate treatment, as cues to avoid inflorescences on damaged plants. This herbivory-induced pollinator limitation can be viewed as a general cost of induced plant responses as well as a specific cost of herbivory-induced volatile emission.","We thank Anurag Agrawal and Robert Raguso for helpful comments and discussion in the preparation of this manuscript.

It was found that original wastewater biofilms are highly tolerant to the Ag-NP treatment. With an application of 200 mg Ag/L Ag-NPs, the reduction of biofilm bacteria measured by heterotrophic plate counts was insignificant after 24 h. After the removal of loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), the viability of wastewater biofilms was reduced when treated under the same conditions. By contrast, when treated as planktonic pure culture, bacteria isolated from the wastewater biofilms were highly vulnerable to Ag-NPs. With a similar initial cell density, most bacteria died within 1 h with the application of 1 mg Ag/L Ag-NPs. The results obtained here indicate that EPS and microbial community interactions in the biofilms play important roles in controlling the antimicrobial effects of Ag-NPs. In addition, slow growth rates may enhance the tolerance of certain bacteria to Ag-NPs. The effects of Ag-NPs on the entire microbial community in wastewater biofilms were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, PCR-DGGE. The studies showed that the microbial susceptibility to Ag-NPs is different for each microorganism. For instance, Thiotrichales is more sensitive to Ag-NPs than other biofilm bacteria.","This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Grant Number 386457, NSERC Research Tools and Instruments, Canadian School of Energy and the Environment, and the Alberta Ingenuity Graduate Scholarship in Nanotechnology.",,Water Research,,Elsevier,"0043-1354, 1879-2448","Adsorption; Bacteria; Biofilms; Biopolymers; Colony Count, Microbial; Extracellular Space; Metal Nanoparticles; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Particle Size; Plankton; Silver; Waste Disposal, Fluid",2011-09-10,2011,2011-09-10,2011-11,45,18,6039-6050,Closed,Article,"Sheng, Zhiya; Liu, Yang","Sheng, Zhiya (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2W2, Canada); Liu, Yang (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2W2, Canada)","Liu, Yang (University of Alberta)","Sheng, Zhiya (University of Alberta); Liu, Yang (University of Alberta)",University of Alberta,grid.17089.37,Edmonton,Alberta,Canada,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council,ICRP - International Cancer Research Partnership,Canada,,,199,28,4.63,20.04,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1025148402,31 Biological Sciences; 3106 Industrial Biotechnology; 32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3206 Medical Biotechnology; 40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering; 4011 Environmental Engineering,Bioengineering; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases; Nanotechnology; Vaccine Related,Infection,,,,B12 Engineering,

The Importance of Scale in Mosquito-Borne Disease,"The epidemiology of vector-borne pathogens is determined by mechanisms and interactions at different scales of biological organization, from individual-level cellular processes to community interactions between species and with the environment. Most research, however, focuses on one scale or level with little integration between scales or levels within scales. Understanding the interactions between levels and how they influence our perception of vector-borne pathogens is critical. Here two examples of biological scales (pathogen transmission and mosquito mortality) are presented to illustrate some of the issues of scale and to explore how processes on different levels may interact to influence mosquito-borne pathogen transmission cycles. Individual variation in survival, vector competence, and other traits affect population abundance, transmission potential, and community structure. Community structure affects interactions between individuals such as competition and predation, and thus influences the individual-level dynamics and transmission potential. Modeling is a valuable tool to assess interactions between scales and how processes at different levels can affect transmission dynamics. We expand an existing model to illustrate the types of studies needed, showing that individual-level variation in viral dose acquired or needed for infection can influence the number of infectious vectors. It is critical that interactions within and among biological scales and levels of biological organization are understood for greater understanding of pathogen transmission with the ultimate goal of improving control of vector-borne pathogens.","J.

Increasing the influent DNP concentrations from 1 to 10 µg ml−1 eliminated large predatory organisms such as rotifers and ciliated protozoa from the SBRs. Under steady-state conditions at a DNP concentration of 10 µg ml−1, supplemental additions of glucose enhanced DNP degradation and led to the establishment of a microbial community consisting of five species of bacteria and a variety of microflagellates. The bacteria and flagellates exhibited oscillating population dynamics in this system, possibly indicating predator-prey interactions between these two groups. Only two of the five bacteria isolated from this system could utilize glucose as a growth substrate, and one of these two species was the only organism that could mineralize DNP in the system. The other three bacteria could grow using metabolic by-products of one of the glucose-utilizing strains (Bacillus cereus) found in the reactors. Supplemental glucose additions increased the average size of bacterial floc particles to 172 µm, compared with 41 µm in SBRs not receiving glucose. It is theorized that the enhanced mineralization of DNP in this non-axenic system was attributable to increased community interactions resulting in increased bacterial flocculation in SBRs receiving supplemental glucose additions.",,,Microbial Ecology,,Springer Nature,"0095-3628, 1432-184X",,1992-06,1992,,1992-06,23,2,127-142,Closed,Article,"Schmidt, S.

Metagenomic analysis has revolutionized our access to these communities, providing a system-scale perspective of microbial community interactions. However, while metagenome sequencing can provide useful estimates of the relative change in abundance of specific genes and taxa between environments or over time, this does not investigate the relative changes in the production or consumption of different metabolites.ResultsWe propose a methodology, Predicted Relative Metabolic Turnover (PRMT) that defines and enables exploration of metabolite-space inferred from the metagenome. Our analysis of metagenomic data from a time-series study in the Western English Channel demonstrated considerable correlations between predicted relative metabolic turnover and seasonal changes in abundance of measured environmental parameters as well as with observed seasonal changes in bacterial population structure.ConclusionsThe PRMT method was successfully applied to metagenomic data to explore the Western English Channel microbial metabalome to generate specific, biologically testable hypotheses. Generated hypotheses linked organic phosphate utilization to Gammaproteobactaria, Plantcomycetes, and Betaproteobacteria, chitin degradation to Actinomycetes, and potential small molecule biosynthesis pathways for Lentisphaerae, Chlamydiae, and Crenarchaeota. The PRMT method can be applied as a general tool for the analysis of additional metagenomic or transcriptomic datasets.","The work was funded by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Biological Systems Science Division under contract DE-AC02-06CH11357 at Argonne, IL.

These fears arise because several direct and indirect mechanisms link warming to disease, and because parasite outbreaks are increasing in many taxa. However, this outcome is not a foregone conclusion, as physiological and community-interaction-based mechanisms may inhibit epidemics at warmer temperatures. Here, we explore this thermal-community-ecology-based mechanism, centering on fish predators that selectively prey upon Daphnia infected with a fungal parasite. We used an interplay between a simple model built around this system's biology and laboratory experiments designed to parameterize the model. Through this data-model interaction, we found that a given density of predators can inhibit epidemics as temperatures rise when thermal physiology of the predator scales more steeply than that of the host. This case is met in our fish-Daphnia-fungus system. Furthermore, the combination of steeply scaling parasite physiology and predation-induced mortality can inhibit epidemics at lower temperatures. This effect may terminate fungal epidemics of Daphnia as lakes cool in autumn. Thus, predation and physiology could constrain epidemics to intermediate temperatures (a pattern that we see in our system). More generally, these results accentuate the possibility that warmer temperatures might actually enhance predator control of parasites.","We thank P. Woodruff, R. Duffy, and J.

It is demonstrated that all of the bacterioplankton, microeukaryotes and inter-kingdom communities networks in Taihu Lake were non-random. For the networks of bacterioplankton and inter-kingdom community in XKB, higher clustering coefficient and average degree but lower average path length indexes were observed, indicating the nodes in XKB were more clustered and closely connected with plenty edges than those of MLB. The bacterioplankton and inter-kingdom networks were considerably larger and more complex with more module hubs and connectors in XKB compared with those of MLB, whereas the microeukaryotes networks were comparable and had no module hubs or connectors in the two lake zones. The phyla of Acidobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Planctomycetes maintained greater cooperation with other phyla in XKB, rather than competition. The relationships between microbial communities and environmental factors in MLB were weaker. Compared with the microbial community networks of XKB, less modules in networks of MLB were significantly correlated with total phosphorous and total nitrogen.","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41571108 and 41671078), Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China (BK20151614), the National Key Technology R&amp;D Program (2015BAD13B01), and Qing Lan Project of Jiangsu Province.",,Scientific Reports,,Springer Nature,2045-2322,Cluster Analysis; Eukaryotic Cells; Lakes; Microbial Interactions; Microbiota; Organic Chemicals; Prokaryotic Cells,2018-06-11,2018,2018-06-11,,8,1,8890,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cao, Xinyi; Zhao, Dayong; Xu, Huimin; Huang, Rui; Zeng, Jin; Yu, Zhongbo","Cao, Xinyi (State Key Laboratory of Hydrology-Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering, College of Hydrology and Water Resources, Hohai University, 210098, Nanjing, China; State Key Laboratory of Lake Science and Environment, Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 210008, Nanjing, China); Zhao, Dayong (State Key Laboratory of Hydrology-Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering, College of Hydrology and Water Resources, Hohai University, 210098, Nanjing, China); Xu, Huimin (State Key Laboratory of Hydrology-Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering, College of Hydrology and Water Resources, Hohai University, 210098, Nanjing, China; State Key Laboratory of Lake Science and Environment, Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 210008, Nanjing, China); Huang, Rui (State Key Laboratory of Hydrology-Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering, College of Hydrology and Water Resources, Hohai University, 210098, Nanjing, China; State Key Laboratory of Lake Science and Environment, Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 210008, Nanjing, China); Zeng, Jin (State Key Laboratory of Lake Science and Environment, Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 210008, Nanjing, China); Yu, Zhongbo (State Key Laboratory of Hydrology-Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering, College of Hydrology and Water Resources, Hohai University, 210098, Nanjing, China)","Zhao, Dayong (State Key Laboratory of Hydrology Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering); Zeng, Jin (Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology)","Cao, Xinyi (State Key Laboratory of Hydrology Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering; Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology); Zhao, Dayong (State Key Laboratory of Hydrology Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering); Xu, Huimin (State Key Laboratory of Hydrology Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering; Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology); Huang, Rui (State Key Laboratory of Hydrology Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering; Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology); Zeng, Jin (Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology); Yu, Zhongbo (State Key Laboratory of Hydrology Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering)",Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology; State Key Laboratory of Hydrology Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering,grid.458478.2; grid.484567.c,Nanjing; Nanjing,; ,China; China,Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China,,China; China,grant.8232374; grant.8236161,41571108; 41671078,43,31,1.24,6.98,6,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27172-z.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1104412640,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3107 Microbiology,,,,,,C14 Geography and Environmental Studies,

We performed a meta-analysis to compare the strength of top-down and bottom-up forces on consumer fitness, considering multiple predictors that can modulate these effects: diet breadth, feeding guild, habitat/environment, type of bottom-up effects, type of top-down effects and how consumer fitness effects are measured. We focused our analyses on the most diverse group of primary consumers, herbivorous insects, and found that in general top-down forces were stronger than bottom-up forces. Notably, chewing, sucking and gall-making herbivores were more affected by top-down than bottom-up forces, top-down forces were stronger than bottom-up in both natural and controlled (cultivated) environments, and parasitoids and predators had equally strong top-down effects on insect herbivores. Future studies should broaden the scope of focal consumers, particularly in understudied terrestrial systems, guilds, taxonomic groups and top-down controls (e.g. pathogens), and test for more complex indirect community interactions. Our results demonstrate the surprising strength of forces exerted by natural enemies on herbivorous insects, and thus the necessity of using a tri-trophic approach when studying insect-plant interactions.","We thank the University of Denver Organismal Biology group, John Lill, Paulo Oliveira and three anonymous reviewers and John Chase for comments on previous versions of this manuscript that greatly improved it.

Many studies have shown the high genetic diversity of green algae from the genus Trebouxia, the most common photobiont of lichen-forming fungi. However, the phylogenetic relationships, and the amount of cryptic diversity of these algae are still poorly understood, and an adequate species concept for trebouxiophycean algae is still missing. In this study we used a multifaceted approach based on coalescence (GMYC, STEM) and phylogenetic relationships to assess species boundaries in the trebouxioid photobionts of the lichen-forming fungus Lasallia pustulata. We further investigated whether putative species of Trebouxia found in L. pustulata are shared with other lichen-forming fungi. We found that L. pustulata is associated with at least five species of Trebouxia and most of them are shared with other lichen-forming fungi, showing different patterns of species-to-species and species-to-community interactions. We also show that one of the putative Trebouxia species is found exclusively in association with L. pustulata and is restricted to thalli from localities with Mediterranean microclimate. We suggest that the species delimitation method presented in this study is a promising tool to address species boundaries within the heterogeneous genus Trebouxia.","We thank the following collectors and curators for providing us with lichen material: Eva Farkas (Vácrátót), Anna Guttova (Bratislava), László Lőkös (Budapest), Jano Nuñez-Zapata (Madrid), Zdenek Palice (Praha), Raquel Pino-Bodas (Madrid), Garima Singh (Frankfurt), Einar Timdal (Oslo), Mercedes Vivas-Rebuelta (Madrid), Robert Vogt (Berlin), Jan Vondrak (Ceske Budejovice).

Such photoautotrophic-heterotrophic mixed-species biofilms have received little attention in biofilm research due to a lack of suitable pure-culture laboratory model systems. However, they offer important insight into microbial population dynamics and community interactions during a biofilm-developmental process that shapes highly structured, extremely well-adapted microbial landscapes. Here, we report on the development of a sterile incubation chamber for growing and monitoring axenic phototrophic biofilms, i.e. a sterilizable, illuminated, continuous-flow system for a routine work with pure cultures. The system has been designed to simulate the growth conditions in the shallow, littoral zone of aquatic habitats (horizontal surface, submerged in water, illuminated, aerated). Additional features of the concept include automated photometrical monitoring of biofilm density (as biofilm turbidity), analysis via confocal microscopy, direct harvesting of cells, and options to control illumination, flow velocity, and composition of culture fluid. The application of the system was demonstrated in growth experiments using axenic diatom biofilms, or axenic diatom biofilms co-cultivated with different bacterial strains isolated from epilithic biofilms of an oligotrophic freshwater lake.","We thank S.

We analyzed the entire co-occurrence networks between the OTUs of Tibet and Yunnan hot spring samples, and found that less abundant OTUs such as genus Tepidimonas (relative abundant <1%) had high-degree centricity (key nodes), while dominant OTUs particularly genus Chloroflexus (relative abundant, 13.9%) formed the peripheral vertexes. A preliminary growth-promotion assay determined that Tepidimonas sp. strain SYSU G00190W enhanced the growth of Chloroflexus sp. SYSU G00190R. Exploiting this result, an ameliorated isolation medium containing 10% spent-culture supernatant of Tepidimonas sp. strain SYSU G00190W was prepared for targeted isolation of Chloroflexi in the Tibet and Yunnan hot spring samples. 16S rRNA gene fingerprinting characterized majority of the colonies isolated from these media as previously uncultivated Chloroflexi, of which 36 are potential novel species (16S rRNA sequence identity <98.5%). Metabolomes studies indicated that the spent-culture supernatant comprises several low-molecular-weight organic substrates that can be utilized as potential nutrients for the growth of these bacteria. These findings suggested that limited knowledge on the interaction of microbes provide threshold to traditional isolation method.","This work is supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 91951205, 91751206, 31370154, 31600298, and 31850410475).

1388,pub.1044259775,10.1111/brv.12105,24720862,,,Cold truths: how winter drives responses of terrestrial organisms to climate change,"Winter is a key driver of individual performance, community composition, and ecological interactions in terrestrial habitats. Although climate change research tends to focus on performance in the growing season, climate change is also modifying winter conditions rapidly. Changes to winter temperatures, the variability of winter conditions, and winter snow cover can interact to induce cold injury, alter energy and water balance, advance or retard phenology, and modify community interactions. Species vary in their susceptibility to these winter drivers, hampering efforts to predict biological responses to climate change. Existing frameworks for predicting the impacts of climate change do not incorporate the complexity of organismal responses to winter. Here, we synthesise organismal responses to winter climate change, and use this synthesis to build a framework to predict exposure and sensitivity to negative impacts. This framework can be used to estimate the vulnerability of species to winter climate change. We describe the importance of relationships between winter conditions and performance during the growing season in determining fitness, and demonstrate how summer and winter processes are linked. Incorporating winter into current models will require concerted effort from theoreticians and empiricists, and the expansion of current growing-season studies to incorporate winter.","Thanks to Dan Hahn, Jessica Hellmann, Jack Millar, Katie Marshall, Mhairi McFarlane and several anonymous referees for constructive criticism of earlier drafts, to Mary Power for helpful discussions, and to Ken Miller, Heath MacMillan and Hiroko Udaka for assistance with the figures.",,Biological Reviews,,Wiley,"1464-7931, 1469-185X",Animals; Climate Change; Cold Temperature; Energy Metabolism; Seasons; Species Specificity,2014-04-10,2014,2014-04-10,2015-02,90,1,214-235,All OA; Green,Article,"Williams, Caroline M.; Henry, Hugh A.

The mechanisms by which a microbial community maintain its overall function, for example, the cycling of carbon, when exposed to a stressor, can be explored by considering three concepts: biotic interactions, functional adaptations, and community structure. Interactions between species are traditionally considered as, e.g., mutualistic, parasitic, or neutral but are here broadly defined as either coexistence or competition, while functions relate to their metabolism (e.g., autotrophy or heterotrophy) and roles in ecosystem functioning (e.g., oxygen production, organic matter degradation). The term structure here align with species richness and diversity, where a more diverse community is though to exhibit a broader functional capacity than a less diverse community. These concepts have here been combined with ecological theories commonly used in resilience studies, i.e., adaptive cycles, panarchy, and cross-scale resilience, that describe how the status and behavior at one trophic level impact that of surrounding levels. This allows us to explore the resilience of a marine microbial community, cultivated in an outdoor photobioreactor, when exposed to a naturally occurring seasonal stress. The culture was monitored for 6weeks during which it was exposed to two different temperature regimes (21 ± 2 and 11 ± 1°C). Samples were taken for metatranscriptomic analysis, in order to assess the regulation of carbon uptake and utilization, and for amplicon (18S and 16S rRNA gene) sequencing, to characterize the community structure of both autotrophs (dominated by the green microalgae Mychonastes) and heterotrophs (associated bacterioplankton). Differential gene expression analyses suggested that community function at warm temperatures was based on concomitant utilization of inorganic and organic carbon assigned to autotrophs and heterotrophs, while at colder temperatures, the uptake of organic carbon was performed primarily by autotrophs. Upon the shift from high to low temperature, community interactions shifted from coexistence to competition for organic carbon. Network analysis indicated that the community structure showed opposite trends for autotrophs and heterotrophs in having either high or low diversity. Despite an abrupt change of temperature, the microbial community as a whole responded in a way that maintained the overall level of diversity and function within and across autotrophic and heterotrophic levels. This is in line with cross-scale resilience theory describing how ecosystems may balance functional overlaps within and functional redundancy between levels in order to be resilient to environmental change (such as temperature).","We would like to thank Diego Brambilla and Daniel Lundin for assistance with the metatranscriptomics pipeline and Maurice Hirwa, Soran Mahmoudi and Fredrik Svensson for assistance at the sampling site and Quyen Nham for assistance with nutrient analyses.","Funding.

To better understand these interactions and community processes, we used chitin, a major carbon and nitrogen source in soil, as a test substrate to investigate microbial interactions during its decomposition. Chitin was applied to a model soil consortium that we developed, ""model soil consortium-2"" (MSC-2), consisting of eight members of diverse phyla and including both chitin degraders and nondegraders. A multiomics approach revealed how MSC-2 community-level processes during chitin decomposition differ from monocultures of the constituent species. Emergent properties of both species and the community were found, including changes in the chitin degradation potential of Streptomyces species and organization of all species into distinct roles in the chitin degradation process. The members of MSC-2 were further evaluated via metatranscriptomics and community metabolomics. Intriguingly, the most abundant members of MSC-2 were not those that were able to metabolize chitin itself, but rather those that were able to take full advantage of interspecies interactions to grow on chitin decomposition products. Using a model soil consortium greatly increased our knowledge of how carbon is decomposed and metabolized in a community setting, showing that niche size, rather than species metabolic capacity, can drive success and that certain species become active carbon degraders only in the context of their surrounding community. These conclusions fill important knowledge gaps that are key to our understanding of community interactions that support carbon and nitrogen cycling in soil. IMPORTANCE The soil microbiome performs many functions that are key to ecology, agriculture, and nutrient cycling. However, because of the complexity of this ecosystem we do not know the molecular details of the interactions between microbial species that lead to these important functions. Here, we use a representative but simplified model community of bacteria to understand the details of these interactions. We show that certain species act as primary degraders of carbon sources and that the most successful species are likely those that can take the most advantage of breakdown products, not necessarily the primary degraders. We also show that a species phenotype, including whether it is a primary degrader or not, is driven in large part by the membership of the community it resides in. These conclusions are critical to a better understanding of the soil microbial interaction network and how these interactions drive central soil microbiome functions.","This research was supported by the Department of Energy’s Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER) and is a contribution of the Scientific Focus Area “Phenotypic response of the soil microbiome to environmental perturbations” (FWP 70880).

However, our knowledge about the responsible atmospheric methane-oxidizing bacteria (atmMOB) in this vast habitat remains limited to date. To address this issue, weathered rock samples from three karst caves were collected in Guilin City and subjected to high-throughput sequencing of pmoA and 16S rRNA genes. The results showed that members of the high-affinity upland soil cluster (USC), especially upland soil cluster gamma (USCγ), with absolute abundances of 104 to 109 copies · g-1 dry sample, dominated the atmMOB communities, while Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria dominated the overall bacterial communities. Moreover, USCγ was a keystone taxon in cooccurrence networks of both the atmMOB and the total bacterial community, whereas keystone taxa in the bacterial network also included Gaiella and Aciditerrimonas. Positive links overwhelmingly dominated the cooccurrence networks of both atmMOB and the total bacterial community, indicating a consistent response to environmental disturbances. Our study shed new insights on the diversity and abundances underlining atmMOB and total bacterial communities and on microbial interactions in subterranean karst caves, which increased our understanding about USC and supported karst caves as a methane sink. IMPORTANCE Karst caves have recently been demonstrated to be a potential atmospheric methane sink, presumably due to consumption by methane-oxidizing bacteria. However, the sparse knowledge about the diversity, distribution, and community interactions of methanotrophs requires us to seek further understanding of the ecological significance of methane oxidation in these ecosystems. Our pmoA high-throughput results from weathered rock samples from three karst caves in Guilin City confirm the wide occurrence of atmospheric methane-oxidizing bacteria in this habitat, especially those affiliated with the upland soil cluster, with a gene copy number of 104 to 109 copies per gram dry sample. Methanotrophs and the total bacterial communities had more positive than negative interactions with each other as indicated by the cooccurrence network, suggesting their consistent response to environmental disturbance. Our results solidly support caves as an atmospheric methane sink, and they contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the diversity, distribution, and interactions of microbial communities in subsurface karst caves.","This work was jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 91951208), the Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi (grant number 2020GXNSFAA297025), and the Geological Survey Project of China (grant number DD20190343).

We found convincing evidence of a community compensatory trend (CCT) in seedling survival (i.e., more abundant species had higher seedling mortality at the 25-ha scale), which suggests that density-dependent mortality may contribute to the spatial dynamics of seedling recruitment. Unlike previous studies, we demonstrate that the CCT was not caused by differences in microhabitat preferences or life history strategy among the study species. In local neighborhood analyses, the spatial autocorrelation of seedling survival was important at small spatial scales (1-5 m) but decayed rapidly with increasing distance. Relative seedling height had the greatest effect on seedling survival. Conspecific seedling density had a more negative effect on survival than heterospecific seedling density and was stronger and extended farther in rare species than in common species. Taken together, the CCT and neighborhood analyses suggest that seedling mortality is coupled more strongly to the landscape-scale abundance of conspecific large trees in common species and the local density of conspecific seedlings in rare species. We conclude that negative density dependence could promote species coexistence in this rain forest community but that the scale dependence of interactions differs between rare and common species.","We thank the Ministerio del Ambiente for authorization to work in Yasuní National Park and R.

However, transmission dynamics remain enigmatic largely because they are difficult to observe directly, particularly in wildlife. Here, we investigate the transmission dynamics of canine parvovirus (CPV) using state-space modelling of 20 years of CPV serology data from domestic dogs and African lions in the Serengeti ecosystem. We show that, although vaccination reduces the probability of infection in dogs, and despite indirect enhancement of population seropositivity as a result of vaccine shedding, the vaccination coverage achieved has been insufficient to prevent CPV from becoming widespread. CPV is maintained by the dog population and has become endemic with approximately 3.5-year cycles and prevalence reaching approximately 80%. While the estimated prevalence in lions is lower, peaks of infection consistently follow those in dogs. Dogs exposed to CPV are also more likely to become infected with a second multi-host pathogen, canine distemper virus. However, vaccination can weaken this coupling, raising questions about the value of monovalent versus polyvalent vaccines against these two pathogens. Our findings highlight the need to consider both pathogen- and host-level community interactions when seeking to understand the dynamics of multi-host pathogens and their implications for conservation, disease surveillance and control programmes.","We thank Tanzania Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries (MoLF), Tanzania National Parks (TANAPA), Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute (TAWIRI), Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority, TAWIRI-Messerli Foundation Wildlife Veterinary Programme, Viral Transmission Dynamics Project, Serengeti Lion Project, Frankfurt Zoological Society, Serengeti Health Initiative, and MoLF District Veterinary Offices in Mara, Mwanza, Shinyanga, and Arusha Regions for assistance with field activities.

Methods for the analysis of the complex biological interactions in mixed infections with a large number of microorganisms are limited and do not effectively determine the contribution of each bacterial species to the pathogenesis of the polymicrobial community. We have developed a novel Drosophila melanogaster infection model to study microbe-microbe interactions and polymicrobe-host interactions. Using this infection model, we examined the interaction of 40 oropharyngeal isolates with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We observe three classes of microorganisms, one of which acts synergistically with the principal pathogen, while being avirulent or even beneficial on its own. This synergy involves microbe-microbe interactions that result in the modulation of P. aeruginosa virulence factor gene expression within infected Drosophila. The host innate immune response to these natural-route polymicrobial infections is complex and characterized by additive, suppressive, and synergistic transcriptional activation of antimicrobial peptide genes. The polymicrobial infection model was used to differentiate the bacterial flora in cystic fibrosis (CF) sputum, revealing that a large proportion of the organisms in CF airways has the ability to influence the outcome of an infection when in combination with the principal CF pathogen P. aeruginosa.","We thank Michael Schoel and the Microscopy and Imaging Facility at the University of Calgary for assistance with the fluorescence microscopy, Paul Kubes, and members of the Surette lab for critical reading of the manuscript.",This work was supported by a grant from the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to MGS.

When economically important introduced predators are stocked despite known negative impacts on native species, understanding the role of refuges, landscape configurations, and community interactions can inform habitat management plans. We measured these factors in basins with introduced trout (Salmonidae) and the Cascades frog (Rana cascadae) to determine, which are responsible for observed patterns of co-occurrence of this economically important predator and its native prey. Large, vegetated shallows were strongly correlated to co-occurrence, and R. cascadae larvae occur in shallower water when fish are present, presumably to escape predation. The number of nearby breeding sites of R. cascadae was also correlated to co-occurrence, but only when the western toad (Anaxyrus boreas) was present. Because A. boreas larvae are unpalatable to fish and resemble R. cascadae, they may provide protection from trout via Batesian mimicry. Although rescue-effect dispersal from nearby populations may maintain co-occurrence, within-lake factors proved more important for predicting co-occurrence. Learning which factors allow co-occurrence between economically important introduced species and their native prey enables managers to make better-informed stocking decisions.","We thank R. Smith, R.

While metagenomics and genomics can be separately used to reveal the culture-independent and culture-based microbial evolution, respectively, (meta)genomics together can be used to demonstrate results at population level revealing in-depth complex community interactions for specific ecotypes. The field of metagenomics which started with answering “who is out there?” based on 16S rRNA gene has evolved immensely with the precise organismal reconstruction at species/strain level from the deeply covered metagenome data outweighing the need to isolate bacteria of which 99% are de facto non-cultivable. In this review we have underlined the appeal of metagenomic-derived genomes in providing insights into the evolutionary patterns, growth dynamics, genome/gene-specific sweeps, and durability of environmental pressures. We have demonstrated the use of culture-based genomics and environmental shotgun metagenome data together to elucidate environment specific genome modulations via metagenomic recruitments in terms of gene loss/gain, accessory and core-genome extent. We further illustrated the benefit of (meta)genomics in the understanding of infectious diseases by deducing the relationship between human microbiota and clinical microbiology.

Here we use an individual-based simulation model of microbial biofilms to investigate how competitive and mutualistic interactions between an antibiotic-resistant and a susceptible strain (or species) influence the two-lineage community response to antibiotic exposure. Our model predicts that while increasing competition and antibiotics leads to increasing competitive release of the antibiotic-resistant strain, hitting a mutualistic community of cross-feeding species with antibiotics leads to a mutualistic suppression effect where both susceptible and resistant species are harmed. We next show that the impact of antibiotics is further governed by emergent spatial feedbacks within communities. Mutualistic cross-feeding communities can rescue susceptible members by subsidizing their growth inside the biofilm despite lack of access to the nutrient-rich and high-antibiotic growing front. Moreover, we show that antibiotic detoxification by resistant cells can protect nearby susceptible cells, but such cross-protection is more effective in mutualistic communities because mutualism drives mixing of resistant and susceptible cells. In contrast, competition leads to segregation, which ultimately prevents susceptible cells to profit from detoxification. Understanding how the interplay between microbial metabolic interactions and community spatial structuring shapes the outcome of antibiotic treatment can be key to effectively leverage the power of antibiotics and promote microbiome health.","Human Frontier Science Program (RGP0011/2014 to SPB; http://www.hfsp.org).

Yet experimental support for the specific roles of such GIs in aquatic community interactions remains scarce. Here, we test for the contribution of type III secretion systems (T3SS) to the environmental fitness of epidemic Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Comparisons of V. parahaemolyticus wild types and T3SS-defective mutants demonstrate that the T3SS encoded on genome island VPaI-7 (T3SS-2) promotes survival of V. parahaemolyticus in the interaction with diverse protist taxa. Enhanced persistence was found to be due to T3SS-2 mediated cytotoxicity and facultative parasitism of V. parahaemolyticus on coexisting protists. Growth in the presence of bacterivorous protists and the T3SS-2 genotype showed a strong correlation across environmental and clinical isolates of V. parahaemolyticus. Short-term microcosm experiments provide evidence that protistan hosts facilitate the invasion of T3SS-2 positive V. parahaemolyticus into a coastal plankton community, and that water temperature and productivity further promote enhanced survival of T3SS-2 positive V. parahaemolyticus. This study is the first to describe the fitness advantage of GI-encoded functions in a microbial food web, which may provide a mechanistic explanation for the global spread and the seasonal dynamics of V. parahaemolyticus pathotypes, including the pandemic serotype cluster O3:K6, in aquatic environments.","We thank Tetsuya Iida (Osaka University) for supplying the POR strains and Michael Steinert (Technical University Braunschweig) for providing original cultures of amoebae, and Christian Erck for supplying polyclonal antibodies.","Funding: Work supporting the construction of the T3SS-2 mutants in LM5674 was supported by The University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine Initiative Grant (to Linda McCarter).

Topological features encountered in complex networks have been proved to provide the systems they represent with interesting attributes such as robustness and stability, which in ecological systems translates into the ability of communities to resist perturbations of different kinds. A focus of research in community ecology is on understanding the mechanisms by which these complex networks of interactions among species in a community arise. We employ an agent-based approach to model ecological processes operating at the species' interaction level for the study of the emergence of organisation in ecological networks.ResultsWe have designed protocols of interaction among agents in a multi-agent system based on ecological processes occurring at the interaction level between species in plant-animal mutualistic communities. Interaction models for agents coordination thus engineered facilitate the emergence of network features such as those found in ecological networks of interacting species, in our artificial societies of agents.ConclusionsAgent based models developed in this way facilitate the automation of the design an execution of simulation experiments that allow for the exploration of diverse behavioural mechanisms believed to be responsible for community organisation in ecological communities. This automated way of conducting experiments empowers the study of ecological networks by exploiting the expressive power of interaction models specification in agent systems.",This work was funded by the European Commission through the Seventh Framework programme Marie Curie Actions.

Herein, we reanalyzed previously published data and highlighted the influence of soil abiotic factors on E. coli O157:H7 survivability and elucidated how these factors took effect indirectly through affecting indigenous bacterial community. Interaction network analysis indicated salinity and pH decreased the relative abundances of some bacterial taxa (e.g., Acidobacteria_Gp4, Acidobacteria_Gp6, and Deltaproteobacteria) which were positively correlated with the survival of E. coli O157:H7 in soils, and vice versa (e.g., Gammaproteobacteria and Flavobacteria) (P < 0.05). An array of multivariate statistical approaches including partial Mantel test, variation partition analysis (VPA), and structural equation model (SEM) further confirmed that biotic and abiotic factors interactively shaped the survival profile of E. coli O157:H7. This study revealed that some bacterial taxa were correlated with survival of E. coli O157:H7 directly, and salinity and pH could affect E. coli O157:H7 survival through changing these bacterial taxa. These findings suggest that salinity in soil might benefit the control of fecal pathogenic E. coli invasion, while soil acidification caused by anthropogenic influences could potentially increase the persistence of E. coli O157:H7 in agro-ecosystem.","We thank Drs.

The study aims to assess the effects of PAHs on the bacterial community of mangrove sediment using both 16s rDNA polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and traditional enrichment methods. Both the exposure time and the PAH concentration reduced the microbial diversity, as determined by the DGGE bands. Although PAHs could act as carbon sources for microorganisms, PAHs, at a concentration as low as 20 mg l−1, posed a toxic effect to the microbial community. Sequencing of DGGE bands showed that marine bacteria from the genera of Vibrio, Roseobacter, and Ferrimonas were most abundant after PAH exposure, which suggests that both marine and terrestrial bacteria coexisted in the mangrove sediment, but that the marine microbes were more difficult to isolate using the traditional culture method. DGGE determination further demonstrated that the consistency among triplicates of the enriched consortia was significantly less than that of the sediment slurries. The present study reveals that the mangrove sediment microbial structure is susceptible to PAH contamination, and complex microbial community interactions occur in mangrove sediment.",The work described in this paper was financially supported by the Research Grants Council of the HKSAR (Project No. RGC reference CityU 1406/06M).

These altered communities may become attractive to gravid mosquitoes searching for oviposition sites when the disturbances decrease the abundance of mosquito antagonists such as competitors, which often results in an increase in mosquito food resources. However, flash flood disturbances in intermittent riverbeds can also remove mosquito food resources such as algae, so that the net effect of flash floods could be either to increase or decrease mosquito abundance. We conducted an outdoor mesocosm experiment to assess the effects of flash floods on mosquito oviposition habitat selection and larval abundance during the post-disturbance period of community recovery. Mesocosms were artificially flooded. Mosquito oviposition, immature abundance, invertebrate species diversity, chlorophyll a, and abiotic parameters were monitored. Our results showed that the flash flood negatively affected phytoplankton and zooplankton, leading to a decrease of mosquito oviposition in flooded mesocosms compared to non-flooded mesocosms. More broadly, this study indicates how disturbances influence mosquito oviposition habitat selection due to the loss of food resources in ephemeral pools, and it highlights the importance of considering the effects of disturbances in management, habitat restoration, and biodiversity conservation in temporary aquatic habitats.","The research was funded by the Israel Science Foundation (ISF) grant 891‐12, awarded to Leon Blaustein and to consultant Matthew Spencer.

We used high-throughput amplicon sequencing of the bacterial small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene from 22 microbial mats collected from four hydrothermally active locations along the Mariana Arc and back-arc to explore the structure of lithotrophically-based microbial mat communities. The vent effluent was classified as iron- or sulfur-rich corresponding with two distinct community types, dominated by either Zetaproteobacteria or Epsilonproteobacteria, respectively. The Zetaproteobacterial-based communities had the highest richness and diversity, which supports the hypothesis that Zetaproteobacteria function as ecosystem engineers creating a physical habitat within a chemical environment promoting enhanced microbial diversity. Gammaproteobacteria were also high in abundance within the iron-dominated mats and some likely contribute to primary production. In addition, we also compare sampling scale, showing that bulk sampling of microbial mats yields higher diversity than micro-scale sampling. We present a comprehensive analysis and offer new insights into the community structure and diversity of lithotrophically-driven microbial mats from a hydrothermal region associated with high microbial biodiversity. Our study indicates an important functional role of for the Zetaproteobacteria altering the mat habitat and enhancing community interactions and complexity.","We wholeheartedly thank the ROV Jason II operations team for their assistance with sample collection during the “Ironman” cruise (November 29th to December 21st, 2014) to the Mariana Submarine Ring of Fire despite challenging weather and nearly unsurmountable technical difficulties.

Viral infection modulates network properties through mortality, gene transfer and metabolic reprogramming.ResultsHere we explore the nature and extent of viral metabolic reprogramming throughout the Pacific Ocean depth continuum. We describe 35 marine viral gene families with potential to reprogram metabolic flux through central metabolic pathways recovered from Pacific Ocean waters. Four of these families have been previously reported but 31 are novel. These known and new carbon pathway auxiliary metabolic genes were recovered from a total of 22 viral metagenomes in which viral auxiliary metabolic genes were differentiated from low-level cellular DNA inputs based on small subunit ribosomal RNA gene content, taxonomy, fragment recruitment and genomic context information. Auxiliary metabolic gene distribution patterns reveal that marine viruses target overlapping, but relatively distinct pathways in sunlit and dark ocean waters to redirect host carbon flux towards energy production and viral genome replication under low nutrient, niche-differentiated conditions throughout the depth continuum.ConclusionsGiven half of ocean microbes are infected by viruses at any given time, these findings of broad viral metabolic reprogramming suggest the need for renewed consideration of viruses in global ocean carbon models.","We thank the following members of the Tucson Marine Phage Laboratory and Hallam Laboratory for their comments on the manuscript: Elke Allers, Jennifer Brum, Li Deng, Melissa Dude-Duhaime, Bonnie Poulos, Jody Wright, and Kendra Mitchell; We also thank Craig Mewis for logistical support, sample collection, and/or processing of viral concentrates; and the UITS Research Computing Group and the ARL Biotechnology Computing for HPC access and support.

Surprisingly little was known of the interaction of viruses and their hosts in nature. In the decade since the reports of extraordinarily large virus populations were published, enumeration of viruses in aquatic environments has demonstrated that the virioplankton are dynamic components of the plankton, changing dramatically in number with geographical location and season. The evidence to date suggests that virioplankton communities are composed principally of bacteriophages and, to a lesser extent, eukaryotic algal viruses. The influence of viral infection and lysis on bacterial and phytoplankton host communities was measurable after new methods were developed and prior knowledge of bacteriophage biology was incorporated into concepts of parasite and host community interactions. The new methods have yielded data showing that viral infection can have a significant impact on bacteria and unicellular algae populations and supporting the hypothesis that viruses play a significant role in microbial food webs. Besides predation limiting bacteria and phytoplankton populations, the specific nature of virus-host interaction raises the intriguing possibility that viral infection influences the structure and diversity of aquatic microbial communities. Novel applications of molecular genetic techniques have provided good evidence that viral infection can significantly influence the composition and diversity of aquatic microbial communities.","During the editing stages of this work, K.E.W. was supported through a National Research Council postdoctoral fellowship.",,Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews,,American Society for Microbiology,"1092-2172, 1098-5557","Animals; Bacteria; Bacteriophages; Chlorophyll; Chlorophyll A; Ecosystem; Gene Transfer Techniques; Models, Biological; Plankton; Virus Physiological Phenomena; Virus Replication; Water Microbiology",2000-03-01,2000,2000-03-01,2000-03,64,1,69-114,All OA; Green,Article,"Wommack, K.

Kuetzing, its epiphytes, and epiphyte grazers","Interactions between epiphytes, epiphyte grazers and the filamentous green alga Cladophora glomerata (L.) Kuetzing were explored with smaples from rivers in Montana. Extracts of C. glomerata lowered photosynthetic rates of Nitzschia fonticola Grunow (an epiphytic diatom). Nutrient enrichment showed that C. glomerata from the Madison River was N deficient and its epiphytes were P deficient on 2 dates and N deficient on one date, while no nutrient deficiencies were detected in samples from 3 other rivers; this implies there was little nutrient competition between the epiphytes and C. glomerata. Epiphytes lowered drag on C. glomerata tufts and current velocity inside the tufts, apparently by decreasing the effective surface area. Lower drag may decrease detachment, but lowering current velocity from 8 to 0 cm s-1 resulted in a 100 % decrease in photosynthesis. Light absorption by epiphyte pigments may lower photosynthetic rate of C. glomerata when irradiance is below 200–500 μE m-2 s-1, and protect against photoinhibition above this irradiance range. Invertebrate grazers (predominantly Baetis tricaudatus Dodds, Trycorythodes minutus Traver and Brachycentrus occidentalis Banks) at high densities removed 75% of epiphytes and B. occidentalis grazed on C. glomerata.

When the wider host ecology is taken into account, the underlying inter-species feedbacks can lead to counter-intuitive results. For example, the ‘healthy herd’ hypothesis posits that the removal of a predator species may not be beneficial for a prey population infected by an endemic disease. In this work, we focus on the effects of including a predator species in a susceptible–infected–susceptible model. Specifically, a key role is played by predator selectivity for either healthy or infected prey. We explored both cases and found important differences in the asymptotic behaviours of the system. Independently from selectivity, large portions of parameter space allow for the coexistence of the three species. However, when predators feed mainly on susceptible prey we find that a fold bifurcation can occur, leading to a region of bi-stability between coexistence and parasite extinction.

However, it is unclear to what extent individual species versus community interactions within the microbiome are linked to host fitness. Here, we combinatorially dissect the natural microbiome of Drosophila melanogaster and reveal that interactions between bacteria shape host fitness through life history tradeoffs. Empirically, we made germ-free flies colonized with each possible combination of the five core species of fly gut bacteria. We measured the resulting bacterial community abundances and fly fitness traits, including development, reproduction, and lifespan. The fly gut promoted bacterial diversity, which, in turn, accelerated development, reproduction, and aging: Flies that reproduced more died sooner. From these measurements, we calculated the impact of bacterial interactions on fly fitness by adapting the mathematics of genetic epistasis to the microbiome. Development and fecundity converged with higher diversity, suggesting minimal dependence on interactions. However, host lifespan and microbiome abundances were highly dependent on interactions between bacterial species. Higher-order interactions (involving three, four, and five species) occurred in 13-44% of possible cases depending on the trait, with the same interactions affecting multiple traits, a reflection of the life history tradeoff. Overall, we found these interactions were frequently context-dependent and often had the same magnitude as individual species themselves, indicating that the interactions can be as important as the individual species in gut microbiomes.","Holger Elbe and Michael Joswig (Technical University of Berlin) scrutinized data to ensure correctness.

Here we used proteogenomics to test the hypothesis that excess input of acetate activates complex community functioning and syntrophic interactions among autotrophs and heterotrophs. A flow-through sediment column was incubated in a groundwater well of an acetate-amended aquifer and recovered during microbial sulfate reduction. De novo reconstruction of community sequences yielded near-complete genomes of Desulfobacter (Deltaproteobacteria), Sulfurovum- and Sulfurimonas-like Epsilonproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Partial genomes were obtained for Clostridiales (Firmicutes) and Desulfuromonadales-like Deltaproteobacteria. The majority of proteins identified by mass spectrometry corresponded to Desulfobacter-like species, and demonstrate the role of this organism in sulfate reduction (Dsr and APS), nitrogen fixation and acetate oxidation to CO2 during amendment. Results indicate less abundant Desulfuromonadales, and possibly Bacteroidetes, also actively contributed to CO2 production via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Proteomic data indicate that sulfide was partially re-oxidized by Epsilonproteobacteria through nitrate-dependent sulfide oxidation (using Nap, Nir, Nos, SQR and Sox), with CO2 fixed using the reverse TCA cycle. We infer that high acetate concentrations, aimed at stimulating anaerobic heterotrophy, led to the co-enrichment of, and carbon fixation in Epsilonproteobacteria. Results give an insight into ecosystem behavior following addition of simple organic carbon to the subsurface, and demonstrate a range of biological processes and community interactions were stimulated.","Funding was provided through the IFRC, Subsurface Biogeochemical Research Program, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research, the US Department of Energy (DOE), with equal support for LBNL employees through LBNL’s Sustainable Systems Scientific Focus Area (contract DE-AC02-05CH11231); and an EMBO Long-Term Fellowship (I Sharon).

Fears of police arrest may deter witnesses of drug overdose from calling for medical help and may be a determinant of drug overdose mortality. To our knowledge, no studies have empirically assessed the relation between levels of policing and drug overdose mortality. We hypothesized that levels of police activity, congruent with fears of police arrest, are positively associated with drug overdose mortality.
METHODS: We assembled cross-sectional time-series data for 74 New York City (NYC) police precincts over the period 1990-1999 using data collected from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of NYC, the NYC Police Department, and the US Census Bureau. Misdemeanor arrest rate-reflecting police activity-was our primary independent variable of interest, and overdose rate our primary dependent variable of interest.
RESULTS: The mean overdose rate per 100,000 among police precincts in NYC between 1990 and 1999 was 10.8 (standard deviation=10.0). In a Bayesian hierarchical model that included random spatial and temporal effects and a space-time interaction, the misdemeanor arrest rate per 1000 was associated with higher overdose mortality (posterior median=0.003, 95% credible interval=0.001, 0.005) after adjustment for overall drug use in the precinct and demographic characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS: Levels of police activity in a precinct are associated with accidental drug overdose mortality.

1323,pub.1132900727,10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa1014,33315094,,,Predicting Nash equilibria for microbial metabolic interactions.,"MOTIVATION: Microbial metabolic interactions impact ecosystems, human health and biotechnology profoundly. However, their determination remains elusive, invoking an urgent need for predictive models seamlessly integrating metabolism with evolutionary principles that shape community interactions.
RESULTS: Inspired by the evolutionary game theory, we formulated a bi-level optimization framework termed NECom for which any feasible solutions are Nash equilibria of microbial community metabolic models with/without an outer-level (community) objective function. Distinct from discrete matrix games, NECom models the continuous interdependent strategy space of metabolic fluxes. We showed that NECom successfully predicted several classical games in the context of metabolic interactions that were falsely or incompletely predicted by existing methods, including prisoner's dilemma, snowdrift and cooperation. The improved capability originates from the novel formulation to prevent 'forced altruism' hidden in previous static algorithms while allowing for sensing all potential metabolite exchanges to determine evolutionarily favorable interactions between members, a feature missing in dynamic methods. The results provided insights into why mutualism is favorable despite seemingly costly cross-feeding metabolites and demonstrated similarities and differences between games in the continuous metabolic flux space and matrix games. NECom was then applied to a reported algae-yeast co-culture system that shares typical cross-feeding features of lichen, a model system of mutualism. 488 growth conditions corresponding to 3221 experimental data points were simulated. Without training any parameters using the data, NECom is more predictive of species' growth rates given uptake rates compared with flux balance analysis with an overall 63.5% and 81.7% reduction in root-mean-square error for the two species respectively.

This phenomenon is an important metric for understanding community functional dynamics, yet the use of spatial patterns for predicting microbial interactions is currently lacking. Here we propose supervised deep learning as a new tool for network inference. An agent-based model was used to simulate the spatiotemporal evolution of two interacting organisms under diverse growth and interaction scenarios, the data of which was subsequently used to train deep neural networks. For small-size domains (100 µm × 100 µm) over which interaction coefficients are assumed to be invariant, we obtained fairly accurate predictions, as indicated by an average R2 value of 0.84. In application to relatively larger domains (450 µm × 450 µm) where interaction coefficients are varying in space, deep learning models correctly predicted spatial distributions of interaction coefficients without any additional training. Lastly, we evaluated our model against real biological data obtained using Pseudomonas fluorescens and Escherichia coli co-cultures treated with polymeric chitin or N-acetylglucosamine, the hydrolysis product of chitin. While P. fluorescens can utilize both substrates for growth, E. coli lacked the ability to degrade chitin. Consistent with our expectations, our model predicted context-dependent interactions across two substrates, i.e., degrader-cheater relationship on chitin polymers and competition on monomers. The combined use of the agent-based model and machine learning algorithm successfully demonstrates how to infer microbial interactions from spatially distributed data, presenting itself as a useful tool for the analysis of more complex microbial community interactions.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

We revisited pioneering data sets collected at the deciduous forested Horonai Stream and conducted ecosystem-level syntheses to demonstrate that the direction of direct and indirect interactions can change depending on the timescale of observation. Prior experimental studies showed that terrestrial prey that enter the stream from the adjacent forest caused positive indirect effects on aquatic invertebrates during summer by diverting fish consumption. Seasonal and annual estimates of secondary production and organic matter flows along food web pathways demonstrate that this seasonal input of terrestrial invertebrate prey increases production of certain fish species, reversing the indirect effect on aquatic invertebrates from positive at the seasonal timescale to negative at the annual timescale. Even though terrestrial invertebrate prey contributed 54% of the annual organic matter flux to fishes, primarily during summer, fish still consumed 98% of the aquatic invertebrate annual production, leading to top-down control that is not revealed in short-term experiments and demonstrating that aquatic prey may be a limiting resource for fishes. Changes in the direction or magnitude of interactions may be a key factor creating nonlinear or stabilizing feedbacks in complex systems, and these dynamics can be revealed by merging experimental and comparative approaches at different scales.","We thank Jennifer Cornell, Fuyuki Goto, Fabio Lepori, and Bob Hall for assistance in field, lab, and analytical work in support of the new data presented in this manuscript.

Co-culturing of fungi has proved to be an efficient way to induce cell-cell interactions that can promote the activation of cryptic pathways, frequently silent when the strains are grown in laboratory conditions. Filamentous fungi represent one of the most diverse microbial groups known to produce bioactive natural products. Triggering the production of novel antifungal compounds in fungi could respond to the current needs to fight health compromising pathogens and provide new therapeutic solutions. In this study, we have selected the fungus Botrytis cinerea as a model to establish microbial interactions with a large set of fungal strains related to ecosystems where they can coexist with this phytopathogen, and to generate a collection of extracts, obtained from their antagonic microbial interactions and potentially containing new bioactive compounds. The antifungal specificity of the extracts containing compounds induced after B. cinerea interaction was determined against two human fungal pathogens (Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus) and three phytopathogens (Colletotrichum acutatum, Fusarium proliferatum, and Magnaporthe grisea). In addition, their cytotoxicity was also evaluated against the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2). We have identified by LC-MS the production of a wide variety of known compounds induced from these fungal interactions, as well as novel molecules that support the potential of this approach to generate new chemical diversity and possible new therapeutic agents.",This work was carried out by RS as part of the Ph.D. Program: ‘New Therapeutic Targets: Discovery and Development of New Antibiotics’ from the School of Master Degrees of the University of Granada.,"Funding.

This should improve our ability to predict shifts in insect population dynamics and community interactions under the conditions of climate change. Effects of elevated CO2 levels on the fitness-related parameters were examined for multigenerations in the Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis (Guenée). The larvae were allowed to feed on artificial diet, and reared in the closed-dynamic environment chambers with three CO2 levels (ambient, 550 μl/liter, and 750 μl/liter) for six generations. In comparison with the ambient CO2 level, mean larval survival rate decreased 9.9% in 750 μl/liter CO2 level, across O. furnacalis generations, and larval and pupal development times increased 7.5-16.4% and 4.5-13.4%, respectively, in two elevated CO2 levels. Pupal weight was reduced more than 12.2% in 750 μl/liter CO2 level. Across O. furnacalis generations, mean food consumption per larva increased 2.7, 7.0% and frass excretion per larva increased 14.4, 22.5% in the two elevated CO2 levels, respectively, compared with ambient CO2 level. Elevated CO2 levels resulted in the decline mean across O. furnacalis generations in mean relative growth rate, but increased in relative consumption rate. These results suggested that elevated CO2 would reduce the fitness-related parameters such as higher mortality, lower pupal weight, and longer development times in long term. It also reduced the larval food digestibility and utilizing efficiency; in turn, this would result in increase of food consumption.","We gratefully acknowledge the reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions on this manuscript.

1323,pub.1042992941,10.1073/pnas.231320498,11606765,PMC60795,,Paternity and relatedness in wild chimpanzee communities,"The genetic structure of three contiguous wild chimpanzee communities in West Africa was examined to determine the extent to which the community, the mixed-sex social unit of chimpanzees, represents a closed reproductive unit. An analysis of paternity for 41 offspring resulted in 34 cases of paternity assignment to an adult male belonging to the same community. Among the 14 offspring for which all potential within-community fathers have been tested, one likely case of extra-group paternity (EGP) has been identified, suggesting an incidence of EGP of 7%. This more extensive analysis contradicts a previous genetic study of the Tai chimpanzees that inferred 50% extra-group fathers. We suggest, based on direct comparison of results for 33 individuals at 1 microsatellite locus and direct comparison of paternity assignments for 11 offspring, that the error rate in the previous study was too high to produce accurate genotypes and assignments of paternity and hence caused the false inference of a high rate of EGP. Thus, the community is the primary but not exclusive unit for reproduction in wild chimpanzees, and females do not typically reproduce with outside males. Despite the inferred low level of gene flow from extra-community males, relatedness levels among the community males are not significantly higher than among community females, and the distribution of genetic relationships within the group suggests that, rather than a primarily male-bonded social structure, the group is bonded through relationships between males and females. Kinship may explain cooperative behaviors directed against other communities, but is unlikely to explain the high levels of affiliation and cooperation seen for male within-community interactions.","We thank the Ivorian authorities for long-term support, especially the Ministry of the Environment and Forests as well as the Ministry of Research, the directorship of the Taï National Park, and the Swiss Research Center in Abidjan.

Gall wasps (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae) induce the formation of galls on their host plants, which house immature wasps and provide them with nutrition and protection. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of JA application on gall development and defenses. Dryocosmus kuriphilus Yasumatsu (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae) galls on American chestnut, Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkhausen (Fagales: Fagaceae), and Chinese chestnut, C. mollissima Blume, were treated with JA or a JA- inhibitor, diethyldithiocarbamic acid (DIECA), to determine the effects of these treatments on gall characteristics and defenses. Chinese chestnut galls treated with JA had greater volume and dry weight, thicker sclerenchyma layers, and fewer external fungal lesions compared with controls. Galls from both chestnut species treated with JA contained a lower proportion of empty chambers, and elevated tannin levels compared with controls. The effects of DIECA on galls were generally opposite from those of JA. American chestnut galls treated with DIECA had lower dry weight and fewer feeding punctures caused by the lesser chestnut weevil compared with controls. Galls from both chestnut species that were treated with DIECA were smaller and had more external fungal lesions compared with controls. Compared to American chestnut galls, Chinese chestnut galls had increased parasitism rates and fewer gall wasps. This study is the first to investigate the effects of JA on an insect gall, and indicates that JA treatments benefit gall wasps by increasing gall size and defenses.","We thank Dr. Fred Hebard of the American Chestnut Foundation for plant material and Dr. Joe Chappell of the University of Kentucky for technical advice.

For example, zooplankton prey on the infectious stage of the amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a pathogen responsible for amphibian population declines and extinctions worldwide. Predation on parasites is predicted to influence community structure and function, and affect disease risk, but relatively few studies have explored its consequences empirically. We investigated interactions among Rana cascadae tadpoles, zooplankton, and Bd in a fully factorial experiment in outdoor mesocosms. We measured growth, development, survival, and infection of amphibians and took weekly measurements of the abundance of zooplankton, phytoplankton (suspended algae), and periphyton (attached algae). We hypothesized that zooplankton might have positive indirect effects on tadpoles by consuming Bd zoospores and by consuming phytoplankton, thus reducing the shading of a major tadpole resource, periphyton. We also hypothesized that zooplankton would have negative effects on tadpoles, mediated by competition for algal resources. Mixed-effects models, repeated-measures ANOVAs, and a structural equation model revealed that zooplankton significantly reduced phytoplankton but had no detectable effects on Bd or periphyton. Hence, the indirect positive effects of zooplankton on tadpoles were negligible when compared to the indirect negative effect mediated by competition for phytoplankton.

While the potential for fungal pathogens to provide biological control has been explored in some detail, less is known about their community interactions. Here we investigate the effects of fungal epizootics of the entomopathogen Lecanicillium lecanii (Zimmerman) on a keystone mutualism between Azteca instabilis (F. Smith), a dominant arboreal ant, and the green coffee scale (Coccus viridis Green), as well as broader impacts on a coffee agroecosystem ant community. We hypothesized that seasonal epizootics cause shifts in the foraging ranges of A. instabilis as the ants adapt to the loss of the resource. We further hypothesized that the magnitude of these shifts depends on the availability of alternate resources located in neighboring shade trees. To test these hypotheses, we induced an epizootic in experimental sites, which were compared with control sites. Surveys of ant activity were undertaken pre- and post-epizootic. We found a decrease in foraging activity of A. instabilis and increase in activity of other ant species in the experimental sites post-epizootic. The decrease in abundance of A. instabilis foragers was greater on plants in which an epizootic was induced than in other plants. This relationship was modified by shade tree density where higher shade tree density was associated with larger decreases in A. intabilis foraging activity in coffee plants. These results demonstrate the potential for fungal entomopathogens to influence the structure and diversity of ecological communities.","We thank B.

Organisms can respond to changing climatic conditions in multiple ways including changes in phenology, body size or morphology, and range shifts. Understanding how developmental temperatures affect insect life-history timing and morphology is crucial because body size and morphology affect multiple aspects of life history, including dispersal ability, while phenology can shape population performance and community interactions. 2. We experimentally assessed how developmental temperatures experienced by aquatic larvae affected survival, phenology, and adult morphology of dragonflies (Pachydiplax longipennis). Larvae were reared under 3 environmental temperatures: ambient, +2.5 °C, and +5 °C, corresponding to temperature projections for our study area 50 and 100 years in the future, respectively. Experimental temperature treatments tracked naturally-occurring variation. 3. We found clear effects of temperature in the rearing environment on survival and phenology: dragonflies reared at the highest temperatures had the lowest survival rates, and emerged from the larval stage approximately 3 weeks earlier than animals reared at ambient temperatures. There was no effect of rearing temperature on overall body size. Although neither the relative wing nor thorax size was affected by warming, a non-significant trend towards an interaction between sex and warming in relative thorax size suggests that males may be more sensitive to warming than females, a pattern that should be investigated further. 4. Warming strongly affected survival in the larval stage and the phenology of adult emergence. Understanding how warming in the developmental environment affects later life-history stages is critical to interpreting the consequences of warming for organismal performance.","We are grateful to Shane Waddell, Virginia Boucher, Chris Hill, Marge Hill, the University of California Natural Reserve System, the Quail Ridge Reserve, and the Wantrup Wildlife Refuge of the Napa Land Trust for research support and access to research sites.

The most sensitive species, the mussel, was affected to the same extent as in previous single species studies, while the effects on the amphipod and alga were smaller or even positive compared to experiments performed in less complex test systems. The observed cascade of beneficial effects was a result of inter-specific species interactions that buffered for more severe effects. The poor condition of the mussel led to a feeding shift from alga to mussel by the amphipods. The better food quality, due to the dietary shift, counteracted the effects of the exposure. Less amphipod grazing, together with increased levels of nutrients in the water was favourable for the alga, despite the negative effects of propranolol. This microcosm study showed effects on organisms on different organizational levels as well as interactions among the different components resulting in indirect exposure effects of both functional and structural nature. The combination of both direct and indirect effects would not have been detected using simpler single- or even two-species study designs. The observed structural changes would in the natural environment have a long-term influence on ecosystem function, especially in a low-biodiversity ecosystem like the Baltic Sea.","The field sampling was financed by an Askö grant from Stockholm University Baltic Sea Center (http://www.su.se/ostersjocentrum/english/) to H.

Here, we describe procedures to investigate the role of bacterial interspecies interactions in root microbiome assembly and the beneficial effects of the root microbiota on hosts by using a maize root-associated simplified seven-species (Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Ochrobactrum pituitosum, Curtobacterium pusillum, Enterobacter cloacae, Chryseobacterium indologenes, Herbaspirillum frisingense and Pseudomonas putida) synthetic bacterial community described in our previous work. Surface-sterilized maize seeds were grown in a gnotobiotic system based on double-tube growth chambers after being soaked in suspensions containing multiple species of bacteria. The dynamics of the composition of the bacterial communities colonized on maize roots were tracked by a culture-dependent method with a selective medium for each of the seven strains. The impact of bacterial interactions on the community assembly was evaluated by monitoring the changes of community structure. The plant-protection effects of the simplified seven-species community were assessed by quantifying (1) the growth of a fungal phytopathogen, Fusarium verticillioides on the surfaces of the seeds and (2) the severity of seedling blight disease the fungus causes, in the presence and absence of the bacterial community.

Here, we study the impact of interactions between coinfecting opportunistic pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa on both phenotypic and genetic changes in a P. aeruginosa social trait, the production of iron-scavenging siderophores. Siderophores are facultatively upregulated in response to iron limitation and play a key role in determining the virulence of microbial infections. Siderophore production is metabolically expensive to individual producers but benefits the group as a whole because siderophores can be used by all cells in the vicinity with siderophore receptors. Hence, populations of siderophore producers can be invaded by nonproducing cheats. Previous work has shown that P. aeruginosa can lyse S. aureus, supplying a source of free iron. We therefore hypothesized that the presence of S. aureus might result in facultative downregulation of siderophore production, and in turn, reduced selection for siderophore cheats. We tested this hypothesis by evolving P. aeruginosa in the presence and absence of free iron and S. aureus, in a fully factorial design. Iron had the expected effect: siderophore production was downregulated and cheats evolved less readily, but the presence of S. aureus instead increased facultative siderophore production and selection for cheats. This is probably because the S. aureus had the net effect of competing for iron, rather than acting as an iron source.

We have addressed these challenges utilising multivariate statistics for analyses of microbial community structures. We based our microbial community analyses on 16S rRNA gene data. This gene is by far the most widely applied genetic marker for phylogenetic and microbial community studies. Both probe and clone library data were analysed. We analysed the clone library data using a newly developed coordinate-based phylogenetic approach. By using coordinates, we avoid both DNA sequence alignments and the need for definition of operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The basic principle is to transform the sequence data to frequencies of multimers (short sequences of n=2 to 6), and then to use principal component analyses (PCA) for data compression into an orthogonal coordinate space. We used our coordinate method for global 16S rRNA gene analyses of prokaryotes. When comparing microbial communities, it is often important to determine the relationship between the microflora and knowledge about the samples analysed. We used partial least square regression (PLSR) to relate physical/chemical properties to microbial community composition. This was done by analysing both probe and clone library data using the effect of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) on fish microflora as an example. We are currently investigating approaches to describe dynamic microbial community interactions. Our ultimate goal is to understand and model the main dynamic interactions in complete microbial communities.","We would like to thank the Norwegian Trust for Certain Agricultural Products, Helse Øst and Hedmark Sparebank for the financial support.",,International Journal of Food Microbiology,,Elsevier,"0168-1605, 1879-3460","Bacteria; DNA, Bacterial; Food Microbiology; Multivariate Analysis; Phylogeny; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Principal Component Analysis; RNA, Bacterial; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Alignment",2007-06-12,2007,2007-06-12,2007-11,120,1-2,95-99,Closed,Article,"Rudi, K.; Zimonja, M.; Trosvik, P.; Næs, T.","Rudi, K.

Larvae are considered to be highly susceptible to offshore transport in productive upwelling regions, thereby increasing dispersal, limiting onshore recruitment, and reducing the intensity of community interactions. We show that 45 species of nearshore crustaceans were not transported far offshore in a recruitment-limited region characterized by strong upwelling. To the contrary, 92% of these larvae remained within 6 km from shore in high densities throughout development along two transects sampled four times during the peak upwelling season. Larvae of most species remained nearshore by remaining below a shallow Ekman layer of seaward-flowing surface waters throughout development. Larvae of other species migrated farther offshore by occurring closer to the surface early in development. Postlarvae evidently returned to nearshore adult habitats either by descending to shoreward-flowing upwelled waters or rising to the sea surface where they can be transported shoreward by wind relaxation events or internal waves. Thus wind-driven offshore transport should not limit recruitment, even in strong upwelling regions, and larvae are more likely to recruit closer to natal populations than is widely believed. This study poses a new challenge to determine the true cause and extent of recruitment limitation for a more diverse array of species along upwelling coasts, and thus to further advance our understanding of the connectivity, dynamics, and structure of coastal populations.","We thank J.

When this microbial ecosystem becomes disrupted, the health of the human host can suffer; a condition called dysbiosis. However, the community compositions of human microbiomes also vary dramatically from individual to individual, and over time, making it difficult to uncover the underlying mechanisms linking the microbiome to human health. We propose that a microbiome’s interaction with its human host is not necessarily dependent upon the presence or absence of particular bacterial species, but instead is dependent on its community metabolome; an emergent property of the microbiome.ResultsUsing data from a previously published, longitudinal study of microbiome populations of the human gut, we extrapolated information about microbiome community enzyme profiles and metabolome models. Using machine learning techniques, we demonstrated that the aggregate predicted community enzyme function profiles and modeled metabolomes of a microbiome are more predictive of dysbiosis than either observed microbiome community composition or predicted enzyme function profiles.ConclusionsSpecific enzyme functions and metabolites predictive of dysbiosis provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of microbiome–host interactions. The ability to use machine learning to predict dysbiosis from microbiome community interaction data provides a potentially powerful tool for understanding the links between the human microbiome and human health, pointing to potential microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutic interventions.","We would like to thank Dr. Lawrence David at the Duke Center for Genomics and Computational Biology for generously providing data from his study of dynamics of the human microbiome.

Theoretical research has predicted two possible paths to stability in intraguild systems: intermediate predators either outcompete higher-order predators for shared resources or select habitat based on security. The effects of intraguild predation on intermediate mammalian predators such as swift foxes (Vulpes velox) are not well understood. We examined the relationships between swift foxes and both their predators and prey, as well the effect of vegetation structure on swift fox-coyote (Canis latrans) interactions, between August 2001 and August 2004. In a natural experiment created by the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site in southeastern Colorado, USA, we documented swift fox survival and density in a variety of landscapes and compared these parameters in relation to prey availability, coyote abundance, and vegetation structure. Swift fox density varied significantly between study sites, while survival did not. Coyote abundance was positively related to the basal prey species and vegetation structure, while swift fox density was negatively related to coyote abundance, basal prey species, and vegetation structure. Our results support the prediction that, under intraguild predation in terrestrial systems, top predator distribution matches resource availability (resource match), while intermediate predator distribution inversely matches predation risk (safety match). While predation by coyotes may be the specific cause of swift fox mortality in this system, the more general mechanism appears to be exposure to predation moderated by shrub density.","Acknowledgments Funding and assistance were provided by the U.S. Army, Directorate of Environmental Compliance and Management (DECAM), Fort Carson, Colorado, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Colorado Assistance Office, Denver, Colorado.

The positive biodiversity-stability relationship emerges via increased resistance and/or recovery to these events. However, invader presence might disrupt this diversity-stability relationship by altering biotic interactions. Investigating such disruptions is important given that invasion by non-native species and extreme climatic events are expected to increase in the future due to anthropogenic pressure. Here we present one of the first multisite invader × biodiversity × drought manipulation experiment to examine combined effects of biodiversity and invasion on drought resistance and recovery at three semi-natural grassland sites across Europe. The stability of biomass production to an extreme drought manipulation (100% rainfall reduction; BE: 88 days, BG: 85 days, DE: 76 days) was quantified in field mesocosms with a richness gradient of 1, 3, and 6 species and three invasion treatments (no invader, Lupinus polyphyllus, Senecio inaequidens). Our results suggest that biodiversity stabilized community productivity by increasing the ability of native species to recover from extreme drought events. However, invader presence turned the positive and stabilizing effects of diversity on native species recovery into a neutral relationship. This effect was independent of the two invader's own capacity to recover from an extreme drought event. In summary, we found that invader presence may disrupt how native community interactions lead to stability of ecosystems in response to extreme climatic events. Consequently, the interaction of three global change drivers, climate extremes, diversity decline, and invasive species, may exacerbate their effects on ecosystem functioning.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was funded by ERA‐Net, BiodivERsA (SIGNAL; http://www.bayceer.uni‐bayreuth.de/signal/index.php?lang=de; Funding ID 01LC1201), the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), BonaRes (SUSALPS; https://www.susalps.de/en/; Funding ID: 031B0027C), the Belgian Federal Science Policy Office (BELSPO), and the Bulgarian Science Found.

Invasive species can alter ecosystem structure over time, further complicating interactions between invasive species and invaded communities in response to additional stressors. Few studies have considered how cumulative impacts of species invasion and global change on the structure of invaded ecosystems may influence persistence and population growth of introduced species. Here, we present an empirically based population model for an invasive epiphytic bryozoan that can dramatically alter the structure of its invaded kelp bed ecosystems. We use this model to predict the response of invasive species to climate change and associated changes in the invaded community. Population growth of the bryozoan increased under near-future projections of increasing ocean temperature; however, the magnitude of population growth depended on the community composition of invaded kelp beds. Our results suggest that, in some cases, indirect effects of climate change mediated through changes to the structure of the invaded habitat can modulate direct effects of climate change on invasive species, with consequences for their long-term ecological impact. Our findings have important implications for management of invasive species, as modifying invaded habitats at local to regional scales may be more logistically feasible than addressing stressors related to global climate change.","We thank J.

Unattached cells are quickly removed by swallowing. Therefore, surface attachment is essential for growth, and we investigated multispecies community interactions resulting in mutualistic growth on saliva as the sole nutritional source. We used two model systems, saliva-coated transferable solid-phase polystyrene pegs (peg biofilms) and flow cells with saliva-coated glass surfaces. Fluorescent antibody staining and image analysis were used to quantify the biomass in flow cells, and quantitative real-time PCR with species-specific primers was used to quantify the biomass in peg biofilms. Veillonella sp. strain PK1910, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans JP2, and Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953 were unable to grow as single species in flow cells. Only A. actinomycetemcomitans grew after 36 h when peg biofilms remained submerged in saliva from the time of inoculation. Mixed-species coaggregates were used for two- and three-species inoculation. The biomass in two-species biofilms increased in both systems when Veillonella sp. strain PK1910 was present as one of the partners. Enhanced growth of all strains was observed in three-species biofilms in flow cells. Interestingly, in flow cells F. nucleatum and A. actinomycetemcomitans exhibited mutualism, and, although F. nucleatum was unable to grow with either of the other species in the peg system, F. nucleatum stimulated the growth of Veillonella sp. and together these two organisms increased the total biomass of A. actinomycetemcomitans in three-species peg biofilms. We propose that mutualistic two-species and multispecies oral biofilm communities form in vivo and that mutualism between commensal veillonellae and late colonizing pathogens, such as aggregatibacteria, contributes to the development of periodontal disease.","This research was supported in part by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, and in part by the Colgate-Palmolive Co.

However, these indicators do not allow the complex biological communities, which can adversely impact the performance of drinking water distribution systems (DWDSs), to be characterized. Entire bacterial communities can be studied quickly and inexpensively using targeted metagenomic amplicon sequencing. Here, amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene region was performed alongside traditional water quality measures to assess the health, quality, and efficiency of two distinct, full-scale DWDSs: (i) a linear DWDS supplied with unfiltered water subjected to basic disinfection before distribution and (ii) a complex, branching DWDS treated by a four-stage water treatment plant (WTP) prior to disinfection and distribution. In both DWDSs bacterial communities differed significantly after disinfection, demonstrating the effectiveness of both treatment regimes. However, bacterial repopulation occurred further along in the DWDSs, and some end-user samples were more similar to the source water than to the postdisinfection water. Three sample locations appeared to be nitrified, displaying elevated nitrate levels and decreased ammonia levels, and nitrifying bacterial species, such as Nitrospira, were detected. Burkholderiales were abundant in samples containing large amounts of monochloramine, indicating resistance to disinfection. Genera known to contain pathogenic and fecal-associated species were also identified in several locations. From this study, we conclude that metagenomic amplicon sequencing is an informative method to support current compliance-based methods and can be used to reveal bacterial community interactions with the chemical and physical properties of DWDSs.","This work was funded by Australian Research Council grants LP110100459 and LP0991985.

For many directly transmitted parasites, predators can reduce transmission by removing the most heavily infected individuals from the population. Less is known about how predators might influence parasite dynamics in systems where the parasite relies on vectors or multiple host species to complete their life cycles. Digenetic trematodes are parasitic flatworms with complex life cycles typically involving three host species. They are common parasites in freshwater systems containing aquatic snails, which serve as obligate first intermediate hosts, and multiple trematode species use amphibians as second intermediate hosts. We experimentally examined the impact of predatory salamanders (Ambystoma jeffersonianum) and trematode parasites (Echinostoma trivolvis and Ribeiroia ondatrae) on short-term survival of wood frog tadpoles (Rana sylvatica) in 150-L outdoor pools. Two trematode species were used in experiments because field surveys indicated the presence of both species at our primary study site. Parasites and predators both significantly reduced tadpole survival in outdoor pools; after 6 days, tadpole survival was reduced from 100% in control pools to a mean of 46% in pools containing just parasites and a mean of 49% in pools containing just predators. In pools containing both infected snails and predators, tadpole survival was further reduced to a mean of 5%, a clear risk-enhancement or synergism. These dramatic results suggest that predators may alter transmission dynamics of trematodes in natural systems, and that a complete understanding of host–parasite interactions requires studying these interactions within the ecological framework of community interactions.","We thank Nichole Field and Eric Tobin for assistance with the experiment.

Most previous studies have focused solely on surface soil, but there were numerous active cells in deeper soil layers. However, studies regarding microbial communities in deeper soil layers were not comprehensive and sufficient. In this study, phylogenetic molecular ecological networks (pMENs) based on the 16S rRNA Miseq sequencing technique were applied to study the response of soil microbial communities to depth gradients and the changes of key genera along 3 meter depth gradients (0-0.2 m, 0.2-0.4 m 0.4-0.6 m, 0.6-0.8 m, 0.8-1.0 m, 1.0-1.3 m, 1.3-1.6 m, 1.6-2.0 m, 2.0-2.5 m, and 2.5-3.0 m). The results showed that the modularity of microbial communities was consistently high in all soil layers and each layer was similar, which indicated that microbial communities were more resistant to depth changes. The pMENs further demonstrated that microbial community interactions were stable as the depth increased and they cooperated well to adapt to changes in different soil gradients. This was evidenced by similar positive links, average degree, and average clustering coefficient. In addition, key genera were obtained by analyzing module hubs in the pMENs. There may be at least one dominant genus in each layer that adapted to and resisted changes in the soil environment. It seems microbial communities demonstrate a stable and strong adaptability to depth gradients in farmland soils.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We gratefully acknowledge Linzhen Guo and Mengfan Yang for soil sampling and Key Laboratory of Environmental and Applied Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences for 16S rRNA Miseq sequencing analysis.

In this paper, we develop a novel approach to gut content analysis, thereby deriving a new perspective on community interactions and their responses to environment. For this, we use an elevational gradient in the High Arctic, asking how the environment and species traits interact in shaping predator-prey interactions involving the wolf spider Pardosa glacialis. To characterize the community of potential prey available to this predator, we used pitfall trapping and vacuum sampling. To characterize the prey actually consumed, we applied molecular gut content analysis. Using joint species distribution models, we found elevation and vegetation mass to explain the most variance in the composition of the prey community locally available. However, such environmental variables had only a small effect on the prey community found in the spider's gut. These observations indicate that Pardosa exerts selective feeding on particular taxa irrespective of environmental constraints. By directly modelling the probability of predation based on gut content data, we found that neither trait matching in terms of predator and prey body size nor phylogenetic or environmental constraints modified interaction probability. Our results indicate that taxonomic identity may be more important for predator-prey interactions than environmental constraints or prey traits. The impact of environmental change on predator-prey interactions thus appears to be indirect and mediated by its imprint on the community of available prey.","We thank Aarhus University for providing access to the Zackenberg Research Station and the Logistics team and the Bio‐basis team for creating an excellent working environment.

However, how this stochasticity affects interactions between competing microbes in mixed communities is difficult to assess. One example of such an interaction system is the competition of an Escherichia coli strain C, which performs division of labor between reproducers and self-sacrificing toxin producers, with a toxin-sensitive strain S. The decision between reproduction or toxin production within a single C cell is inherently stochastic. Here, combining experimental and theoretical approaches, we demonstrate that this stochasticity in the initial phase of colony formation is the crucial determinant for the competition outcome. In the initial phase (t < 12h), stochasticity influences the formation of viable C clusters at the colony edge. In the subsequent phase, the effective fitness differences (set primarily by the degree of division of labor in the C strain population) dictate the deterministic population dynamics and consequently competition outcome. In particular, we observe that competitive success of the C strain is only found if (i) a C edge cluster has formed at the end of the initial competition phase and (ii) the beneficial and detrimental effects of toxin production are balanced, which is the case at intermediate toxin producer fractions. Our findings highlight the importance of stochastic processes during the initial phase of colony formation, which might be highly relevant for other microbial community interactions in which the random choice between phenotypes can have long-lasting consequences for community fate.","B.v.B was supported by a DFG Fellowship through the Graduate School of Quantitative Biosciences Munich (QBM).

The nature of abundance-body size relationships in animal communities, and especially the drivers behind the observed patterns, have been a focus of persistent debate in animal ecology. In a recent review, Allen et al. (2006) categorized five mechanistic explanations behind the commonly observed polymodality in these relationships: energetic constraints; phylogenetic constraints; biogeographical determinants; habitat structure; and community interactions. Progress in understanding of these patterns and the processes underlying them have been hindered by the use of a range of methods that differ in their validity and robustness. 2. Here, we used data on invertebrate body sizes from a variety of sandy beaches in the UK to test the hypothesis that these communities display modality in their abundance-body size relationships. We quantified modality in the relationships using kernel density estimation and smoothed bootstrap resampling and then evaluated the competing explanations for this modality based on the patterns identified in conjunction with measurements of the physical beach environment. 3. We found bimodal distributions in the body size spectrum for benthic invertebrates at nine of 16 sites. There was a consistent trough in the spectrum at around 0·5-1 mm diameter, which reflected the traditional split between meiofauna and macrofauna. Beaches with finer particle sizes and more heterogeneous macrofauna hosted communities with more than two modes. 4. Our results suggest that modality in sandy beach benthic communities is unlikely to be explained by any single hypothesis. There will be an interplay between physical and biological factors, with different explanations accounting for modality at different scales.","We would like to thank Jim Smart for developing the code in R to run the kernel density estimations for biomass, Toyonobu Fujii for providing beach slope data for the Humber Estuary and Toyonobu Fujii, Mark Bulling, Martin Solan, Jasmin Godbold, Jemma Finch and Elizabeth Curmi for field assistance.

It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth. This partner-induced change in gene expression that benefits the partner is a paradigm for microbial interactions that cannot be observed in studies of pure cultures, underscoring the importance of synthetic microbial community approaches to understand environmental microbiomes.","This study was supported by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research under Award DE-SC-0010556.",,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,"0027-8424, 1091-6490","Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Bacteria; Bacterial Proteins; Carbon; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Lanthanoid Series Elements; Methane; Methanol; Microbial Interactions; Oxidation-Reduction; Washington",2016-12-27,2016,2016-12-27,2017-01-10,114,2,358-363,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Krause, Sascha M.

The Asian chestnut gall wasp, Dryocosmus kuriphilus Yasumatsu, is an invasive pest that is destructive to chestnut (Castanea spp.). An improved understanding of the interactions among D. kuriphilus, its host, and its natural enemies is critical for the development of effective management strategies against this pest. The objective of our study was to evaluate the D. kuriphilus community interactions, and relate these interactions to variations among gall traits. Galls were collected from four locations throughout the eastern United States from May (gall initiation) through August (after gall wasp emergence), and January. Gall characteristics (volume, weight, and schlerenchyma layer thickness), gall inhabitants (D. kuriphilus, parasitoids, and chamber fungi), and other community associates (insect herbivores and lesions thought to be caused by endophytes) were evaluated and correlated using canonical correlation analyses. The primary mortality factors for D. kuriphilus were parasitism, gall chamber-invading fungi, and failure of adult gall wasps to emerge. Larger gall size and thicker schlerenchyma layers surrounding the larval chambers were negatively correlated with parasitoids and chamber fungi, indicating these gall traits are important defenses. External fungal lesions and insect herbivory were positively correlated with the absence of D. kuriphilus within galls. This study provides support for the protective role of cynipid galls for the gall inducer, identifies specific gall traits that influence gall wasp mortality, and improves our knowledge of D. kuriphilus ecology in North America.","We thank Fred Hebard (American Chestnut Foundation), Steve Hartman, Edgar Stehli, and Bob Stehli for plant material.

A myriad of ongoing studies aim at identifying links between microbial community disequilibria (dysbiosis) and human diseases. However, due to the inherent complexity and heterogeneity of the human microbiome, cross-sectional, case–control and longitudinal studies may not have enough statistical power to allow causation to be deduced from patterns of association between variables in high-resolution omic datasets. Therefore, to move beyond reliance on the empirical method, experiments are critical. For these, robust experimental models are required that allow the systematic manipulation of variables to test the multitude of hypotheses, which arise from high-throughput molecular studies. Particularly promising in this respect are microfluidics-based in vitro co-culture systems, which allow high-throughput first-pass experiments aimed at proving cause-and-effect relationships prior to testing of hypotheses in animal models. This review focuses on widely used in vivo, in vitro, ex vivo and in silico approaches to study host-microbial community interactions. Such systems, either used in isolation or in a combinatory experimental approach, will allow systematic investigations of the impact of microbes on the health and disease of the human host. All the currently available models present pros and cons, which are described and discussed. Moreover, suggestions are made on how to develop future experimental models that not only allow the study of host-microbiota interactions but are also amenable to high-throughput experimentation.",The present work was supported by ATTRACT (ATTRACT/A09/03) and CORE (11/BM/1186762) program grants funded by the Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR).,,Microbiome,,Springer Nature,2049-2618,,2013-05-03,2013,2013-05-03,2013-12,1,1,14,All OA; Gold,Article,"Fritz, Joëlle V; Desai, Mahesh S; Shah, Pranjul; Schneider, Jochen G; Wilmes, Paul","Fritz, Joëlle V (Eco-Systems Biology Group, Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine, University of Luxembourg, Avenue des Hauts-Fourneaux, 7, L-4362, Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg); Desai, Mahesh S (Eco-Systems Biology Group, Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine, University of Luxembourg, Avenue des Hauts-Fourneaux, 7, L-4362, Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg); Shah, Pranjul (Eco-Systems Biology Group, Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine, University of Luxembourg, Avenue des Hauts-Fourneaux, 7, L-4362, Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg); Schneider, Jochen G (Translational & Experimental Research Group, Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine, University of Luxembourg, Avenue des Hauts-Fourneaux, 7, L-4362, Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg; Department of Medicine II, Saarland University Medical Center, Kirrberger Str, D-66421, Homburg/Saar, Germany); Wilmes, Paul (Eco-Systems Biology Group, Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine, University of Luxembourg, Avenue des Hauts-Fourneaux, 7, L-4362, Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg)","Wilmes, Paul (University of Luxembourg)","Fritz, Joëlle V (University of Luxembourg); Desai, Mahesh S (University of Luxembourg); Shah, Pranjul (University of Luxembourg); Schneider, Jochen G (University of Luxembourg; Universitätsklinikum des Saarlandes); Wilmes, Paul (University of Luxembourg)",Universitätsklinikum des Saarlandes; University of Luxembourg,grid.411937.9; grid.16008.3f,Homburg; Luxembourg,; ,Germany; Luxembourg,,,,,,140,32,3.42,11.06,17,https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/2049-2618-1-14,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1037326091,31 Biological Sciences; 3107 Microbiology,Biotechnology; Clinical Research,,2.1 Biological and endogenous factors,Not Site-Specific Cancer,1.5 Resources and Infrastructure; 2.1 Exogenous Factors in the Origin and Cause of Cancer,B11 Computer Science and Informatics,

The gall-maker-host plant interaction is highly evolved, and galls represent an extended phenotype of the gall wasp. We evaluated two-way interactions between stem galls produced by Dryocosmus kuriphilus Yasumatsu on Castanea spp. (Fagales: Fagaceae) and foliage directly attached to galls (gall leaves) using gall leaf excision experiments and herbivore bioassays. Early season gall leaf excision decreased the dry weight per chamber (nutritive index) and thickness of the protective schlerenchyma layer and increased the number of empty chambers and the occurrence and size of exterior fungal lesions. Leaf excision also caused a modestly significant (alpha = 0.1) increase in the incidence of feeding chamber fungi and herbivory by Curculio sayi Gyllenhal (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), and a modest decrease in parasitoids. This study shows that gall leaves are important for stem gall development, quality, and defenses, adding support for the nutrient and enemy hypotheses. We also evaluated the effects of stem galls on the suitability of gall leaves to Lymantria dispar L. (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae) herbivory to assess the extent of gall defenses in important source leaves. Relative growth rate of L. dispar larvae was greater on gall leaves compared with normal leaves, indicating that, despite their importance, gall leaves may be more suitable to generalist insect herbivores, suggesting limitations to the extended phenotype of the gall wasp. Our results improve our knowledge of host-cynipid interactions, gall source-sink relations, and D. kuriphilus community interactions.","We thank F.

Traditionally, MRSA was mainly hospital-associated (HA-MRSA), but in the past decade community-associated strains (CA-MRSA) have spread widely. CA-MRSA strains seem to have significantly lower biological costs of resistance, and hence it has been speculated that they may replace HA-MRSA strains in the hospital. Such a replacement could potentially have major consequences for public health, as there are differences in the resistance spectra of the two strains as well as possible differences in their clinical effects. Here we assess the impact of competition between HA- and CA-MRSA using epidemiological models which integrate realistic data on drug-usage frequencies, resistance profiles, contact, and age structures. By explicitly accounting for the differing antibiotic usage frequencies in the hospital and the community, we find that coexistence between the strains is a possible outcome, as selection favors CA-MRSA in the community, because of its lower cost of resistance, while it favors HA-MRSA in the hospital, because of its broader resistance spectrum. Incorporating realistic degrees of age- and treatment-structure into the model significantly increases the parameter ranges over which coexistence is possible. Thus, our results indicate that the large heterogeneities existing in human populations make coexistence between hospital- and community-associated strains of MRSA a likely outcome.","RK was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (Grants PA00P3_131498 and PZ00P3_142411).

Here, we examined the effect of changes in organic acids among other parameters on snow microbial communities in situ over 2 months. We compared snow bacterial communities from a low organic acid content period to that from a higher organic acid period. We hypothesized that an increase in organic acids would shift the dominant microbial interaction from collaboration to competition. To evaluate microbial interactions, we built taxonomic co-variance networks from OTUs obtained from 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In addition, we tracked marker genes of microbial cooperation (plasmid backbone genes) and competition (antibiotic resistance genes) across both sampling periods in metagenomes and metatranscriptomes. Our results showed a decrease in the average connectivity of the network during late spring compared to the early spring that we interpreted as a decrease of cooperation. This observation was strengthened by the significantly more abundant plasmid backbone genes in the metagenomes from the early spring. The modularity of the network from the late spring was also found to be higher than the one from the early spring, which is another possible indicator of increased competition. Antibiotic resistance genes were significantly more abundant in the late spring metagenomes.

Although experimental tests of theory from a range of biological systems are largely concordant regarding the influence of several driving processes, we know little as to how mechanisms acting at the smallest scales (individual molecular and phenotypic changes) may result in the emergence of structures at larger scales, such as co-evolutionary dynamics and local adaptation. We capitalized on methods commonly employed in community ecology to quantify how the structure of community interaction matrices, so-called bipartite networks, reflected observed co-evolutionary dynamics, and how phages from these communities may or may not have adapted locally to their bacterial hosts. We found a consistent nested network structure for two phage types, one previously demonstrated to exhibit arms race co-evolutionary dynamics and the other fluctuating co-evolutionary dynamics. Both phages increased their host ranges through evolutionary time, but we found no evidence for a trade-off with impact on bacteria. Finally, only bacteria from the arms race phage showed local adaptation, and we provide preliminary evidence that these bacteria underwent (sometimes different) molecular changes in the wzy gene associated with the LPS receptor, while bacteria co-evolving with the fluctuating selection phage did not show local adaptation and had partial deletions of the pilF gene associated with type IV pili. We conclude that the structure of phage-bacteria interaction networks is not necessarily specific to co-evolutionary dynamics, and discuss hypotheses for why only one of the two phages was, nevertheless, locally adapted.",We thank Sylvain Gandon and Mathilde Besson for discussions and three reviewers for their comments.

Intestinal helminths are host immunomodulators and have evolved both temporally and spatially in close association with the gut microbiota, resulting in potential mechanistic interplay. Host-helminth and host-microbiota interactions are comparatively well-examined, unlike microbiota-helminth relationships, which typically focus on experimental infection with a single helminth species in laboratory animals. Here, in addition to a review of the literature on helminth-microbiota interactions, we examined empirically the association between microbiota diversity and composition and natural infection of multiple helminth species in wild mice (Apodemus flavicollis), using 16S rRNA gene catalogues (metataxonomics). In general, helminth presence is linked with high microbiota diversity, which may confer health benefits to the host. Within our wild rodent system variation in the composition and abundance of gut microbial taxa associated with helminths was specific to each helminth species and occurred both up- and downstream of a given helminth's niche (gut position). The most pronounced helminth-microbiota association was between the presence of tapeworms in the small intestine and increased S24-7 (Bacteroidetes) family in the stomach. Helminths clearly have the potential to alter gut homeostasis. Free-living rodents with a diverse helminth community offer a useful model system that enables both correlative (this study) and manipulative inference to elucidate helminth-microbiota interactions.","Thanks to Adam Konečný and Valentina Tagliapietra for providing the animals and for the fieldwork, and to Massimo Pindo for helping to optimize the pyrosequencing protocol.

For example, parasitic dodder (Cuscuta spp.) can cause up to 80–100 % yield loss in heavily infested cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) patches. Despite their ecological and economic importance, remarkably little is known about how parasitic plants affect, or are affected by, host chemistry. To examine chemically-mediated interactions between dodder and its cranberry host, we conducted a greenhouse experiment asking whether: (1) dodder performance varies with cranberry cultivar; (2) cultivars differ in levels of phytohormones, volatiles, or phenolics, and whether such variation correlates with dodder parasitism; (3) dodder parasitism induced changes in phytohormones, volatiles, or phenolics, and whether the level of inducible response varied among cultivars. We used five cranberry cultivars to assess host attractiveness to dodder and dodder performance. Dodder performance did not differ across cultivars, but there were marginally significant differences in host attractiveness to dodder, with fewer dodder attaching to Early Black than to any other cultivar. Dodder parasitism induced higher levels of salicylic acid (SA) across cultivars. Cultivars differed in overall levels of flavonols and volatile profiles, but not phenolic acids or proanthocyanidins, and dodder attachment induced changes in several flavonols and volatiles. While cultivars differed slightly in resistance to dodder attachment, we did not find evidence of chemical defenses that mediate these interactions. However, induction of several defenses indicates that parasitism alters traits that could influence subsequent interactions with other species, thus shaping community dynamics.","We thank Sneha Sha and Nicholi Vorsa for conducting the phenolic profile analysis, Cesar Rodriguez-Saona for help with volatile analysis, Rayko Halitschke for assistance in the phytohormone analyses, former and present Adler lab members for comments on the manuscript, Zara Dowling, Mjege Kinyota, and Jared Kelly for help with data collection, the UMass Cranberry Station (especially James O’Connell and Katherine Ghantous) for cranberry cultivation and supply of dodder seed, a Fulbright Fellowship and Faculty for the Future Fellowship (MCT), Plant Biology Graduate program (MCT), USDA/CSREES (Hatch) MAS000411 (LSA) and USDA NRI 2008-02346 (LSA) for financial support.",,Journal of Chemical Ecology,,Springer Nature,"0098-0331, 1573-1561",Cuscuta; Phenols; Plant Growth Regulators; Plant Leaves; Vaccinium macrocarpon,2016-02-23,2016,2016-02-23,2016-02,42,2,95-106,Closed,Article,"Tjiurutue, Muvari Connie; Sandler, Hilary A.; Kersch-Becker, Monica F.; Theis, Nina; Adler, Lynn A.","Tjiurutue, Muvari Connie (Biology Department, University of Massachusetts Amherst, 221 Morrill Science Center South, 611 North Pleasant Street, 01003, Amherst, MA, USA); Sandler, Hilary A.

Less, however, is known about how indirect effects of contaminants on consumer physiology or behavior might alter community interactions or ecosystem processes. We examined whether a potential aquatic contaminant, an ionic liquid, can indirectly alter benthic algal biomass and primary production through direct effects on herbivorous snails. Ionic liquids are nonvolatile organic salts being considered as an environmentally friendly potential replacement for volatile organic compounds in industry. In two greenhouse experiments, we factorially crossed four concentrations of 1-N-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (bmimBr; experiment 1: 0 or 10 mg/L; experiment 2: 0, 1, or 100 mg/L) with the presence or absence of the snail Physa acuta in aquatic mesocosms. Experimental results were weighted by their respective control (no bmimBr or P. acuta) and combined for statistical analysis. When both bmimBr and snails were present, chlorophyll a abundance and algal biovolume were higher than would be expected if both factors acted additively. In addition, snail growth rates, relative to those of controls, declined by 41 to 101% at 10 and 100 mg/L of bmimBr. Taken together, these two results suggest that snails were less efficient grazers in the presence of bmimBr, resulting in release of algae from the grazer control. Snails stimulated periphyton primary production in the absence, but not in the presence, of bmimBr, suggesting that bmimBr also can indirectly alter ecosystem function. These findings suggest that sublethal contaminant levels can negatively impact communities and ecosystem processes via complex interactions, and they provide baseline information regarding the potential effects of an emergent industrial chemical on aquatic systems.","We thank J.

Invasion by novel ecological types into a community can press a system beyond the bounds normally seen and can reveal community interactions, local drivers and limits within systems that are otherwise hidden by coevolution and a long evolutionary history among local players, as well as local adaptation of species. The success of many invaders is attributed to their ability to thrive in a wide range of habitat types and physical conditions, setting the stage for direct examination of ecological impacts of a species across a range of habitat and community contexts. Bivalves are well-known ecosystem engineers, especially oysters, which are the target of wild-caught fisheries and aquaculture. The Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, is grown worldwide for aquaculture, and is presently invading shores on virtually every continent. As a consequence, this non-native species is having large impacts on many systems, but the types of impacts are system specific, and greatly depend on substrate type, how physiologically stressful the environment is for intertidal zone species, and the presence of native engineering species. A novel type of engineering effect is identified for this non-native species, whereby it alters not only the physical environment, but also the thermal environment of the community it invades. The impacts of engineering by this non-native species will depend not only on whether it facilitates or inhibits species but also on the trophic level and ecological role of the species affected, and whether similar ecological types are found within the system.","The National Science Foundation (IOS-0938257 to S.B. and L.W.); The Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology Division of Ecology and Evolution and the Division of Invertebrate Zoology, and the American Microscopical Society, and National College Sea Grant Program (Award NA16RG1044, R/ES-54).

These effects may be exacerbated under warming in ecosystems like the Arctic, where the number and diversity of predators are low and small shifts in community interactions can alter carbon cycle feedbacks. Here, we show that warming alters the effects of wolf spiders, a dominant tundra predator, on belowground litter decomposition. Specifically, while high densities of wolf spiders result in faster litter decomposition under ambient temperatures, they result, instead, in slower decomposition under warming. Higher spider densities are also associated with elevated levels of available soil nitrogen, potentially benefiting plant production. Changes in decomposition rates under increased wolf spider densities are accompanied by trends toward fewer fungivorous Collembola under ambient temperatures and more Collembola under warming, suggesting that Collembola mediate the indirect effects of wolf spiders on decomposition. The unexpected reversal of wolf spider effects on Collembola and decomposition suggest that in some cases, warming does not simply alter the strength of top-down effects but, instead, induces a different trophic cascade altogether. Our results indicate that climate change-induced effects on predators can cascade through other trophic levels, alter critical ecosystem functions, and potentially lead to climate feedbacks with important global implications. Moreover, given the expected increase in wolf spider densities with climate change, our findings suggest that the observed cascading effects of this common predator on detrital processes could potentially buffer concurrent changes in decomposition rates.","We thank undergraduate assistants Kiki Contreras and Samantha Walker, PolarTREC (Teachers and Researchers Exploring and Collaborating) teacher Nick LaFave, Greg Selby, Rod Simpson, Jennie McLaren, Jason Stuckey, and the staff of the Toolik Field Station for assistance in the field and Ashley Asmus, Laura Gough, and two anonymous reviewers for helpful feedback on earlier drafts of this manuscript.

Reactive azo dye degradation, being a major constituent of these pollutants and perilous material, has been constantly receiving scientific attention. In textile industry, use of Remazole Brilliant Violet 5R (RBV5R) as reactive azo dyes is more frequent. Highly competent, RBV5R-degrading bacterial consortium VIE6 was developed from the soil of the Vatva Industrial Estate, Gujarat, India. Consortium VIE6 comprised of five bacterial strains Bacillus sp. DMB1, Staphylococcus sp. DMB2, Escherichia sp. DMB3, Enterococcus sp. DMB4, and Pseudomonas sp. DMB5. These strains convened a better decolorization efficiency between 200 and 1000 mg/L of dye concentration and were much stable at pH 6.5, 37 °C. Azoreductase, laccase, and lignin peroxidase activities of consortium showed significant variation throughout the degradation process indicating the different metabolic capabilities of the existing microflora. The community interactions and synergism were shown to facilitate the biotransformation of RBV5R by combination of various electron donors. Voltammograms revealed the variations in electron discharge properties which coincide with the dynamics of community derived using qPCR assays.

Here, the degradative pathway for atrazine was examined for a complex 8-membered enrichment culture. The species composition of the culture was determined by PCR-DGGE. The bacterial species included Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Caulobacter crescentus, Pseudomonas putida, Sphingomonas yaniokuyae, Nocardia sp., Rhizobium sp., Flavobacterium oryzihabitans, and Variovorax paradoxus. All of the isolates were screened for the presence of known genes that function for atrazine degradation including atzA,-B,-C,-D,-E,-F and trzD,-N. Dechlorination of atrazine, which was obligatory for complete mineralization, was carried out exclusively by Nocardia sp., which contained the trzN gene. Following dechlorination, the resulting product, hydroxyatrazine was further degraded via two separate pathways. In one pathway Nocardia converted hydroxyatrazine to N-ethylammelide via an unidentified gene product. In the second pathway, hydroxyatrazine generated by Nocardia sp. was hydrolyzed to N-isopropylammelide by Rhizobium sp., which contained the atzB gene. Each member of the enrichment culture contained atzC, which is responsible for ring cleavage, but none of the isolates carried the atzD,-E, or -F genes. Each member further contained either trzD or exhibited urease activity. The enrichment culture was destabilized by loss of Nocardia sp. when grown on ethylamine, ethylammelide, and cyanuric acid, after which the consortium was no longer able to degrade atrazine. The analysis of this enrichment culture highlights the broad level bacterial community interactions that may be involved in atrazine degradation in nature.",This research was supported by a grant from the University of California Toxic Substances Training and Research Program.,,FEMS Microbiology Ecology,,Oxford University Press (OUP),"0168-6496, 1574-6941","Atrazine; Bacteria; Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional; Herbicides; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Soil Microbiology",2005-01-19,2005,2005-01-19,2005-07-01,53,2,265-275,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Smith, Daniel; Alvey, Sam; Crowley, David E.","Smith, Daniel (Department of Environmental Sciences, University of California, Riverside, CA 92521, USA); Alvey, Sam (Department of Environmental Sciences, University of California, Riverside, CA 92521, USA); Crowley, David E.

This can further impact resource flow by providing refuge for prey and decreasing predation rates. However, the direct influence of different organic subsidies on predator–prey dynamics is rarely examined. In forested wetlands, leaf litter inputs are a dominant energy and nutrient resource and they can also increase benthic surface cover and decrease water clarity, which may provide refugia for prey and subsequently reduce predation rates. In outdoor mesocosms, we investigated how inputs of leaf litter that alter benthic surface cover and water clarity influence the mortality and growth of gray treefrog tadpoles (Hyla versicolor) in the presence of free-swimming adult newts (Notophthalmus viridiscens), which are visual predators. To manipulate surface cover, we added either oak (Quercus spp.) or red pine (Pinus resinosa) litter and crossed these treatments with three levels of red maple (Acer rubrum) litter leachate to manipulate water clarity. In contrast to our predictions, benthic surface cover had no effect on tadpole survival while darkening the water caused lower survival. In addition, individual tadpole mass was lowest in the high maple leachate treatments, suggesting an interaction between bottom-up effects of leaf litter and top-down effects of predation risk that altered mortality and growth of tadpoles. Our results indicate that realistic changes in forest tree composition, which cause concomitant changes in litter inputs to wetlands, can substantially alter community interactions.","Our thanks to R.

Amphibians are experiencing population declines, and a fungal pathogen (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; Chytridiomycota) is a suspected causal agent in many declines. We studied the effects of a pathogenic fungus on community interactions between the gray treefrog, Hyla chrysoscelis, and eastern newts, Notophthalmus viridescens. Recent studies have characterized chytridiomycosis as an emerging infectious disease, whose suspected rapid range expansion and widespread occurrence pose a significant risk for amphibian populations worldwide. We reared larvae in outdoor polyethylene experimental tanks and tested the effects of initial larval density, predator presence, and fungal exposure on Hyla recruitment and predator-prey interactions between Hyla and Notophthalmus. Newts reduced treefrog survival, and high intraspecific density decreased metamorphic body mass independent of B. dendrobatidis. The presence of fungi reduced treefrog body mass at metamorphosis by 34%, but had no significant main effect on survival or larval period length. B. dendrobatidis differentially affected larval development in the presence of predators; Hyla developed slower when reared with the pathogen, but only when newts were present. This significant predator-by-pathogen interaction suggests that the impact of chytridiomycosis on larval amphibians may be exacerbated in complex communities. Our data suggest that B. dendrobatidis effects on host life history may be complex and indirect. Direct measurements of the community-level effects of pathogens offer an important opportunity to understand a significant threat to global biodiversity—declining amphibian populations.","We thank J.

Although the dominant members of these deposits drive the structure of the microbial communities, it is less well understood whether the lower abundance groups are as closely connected to the geochemical milieu, or driven perhaps by biotic factors such as microbial community interactions. We used the natural geochemical gradients that exist in the back-arc basin, Eastern Lau Spreading Center and Valu-Fa Ridge (ELSC/VFR) in the Southwestern Pacific, to explore whether the chemolithotrophic Aquificales are influenced by geographical location, host-rock of the vent field or deposit type. Using a combination of cloning, DNA fingerprinting (DGGE) and enrichment culturing approaches, all genera of this order previously described at marine vents were detected, i.e., Desulfurobacterium, Thermovibrio, Aquifex, Hydrogenivirga, Persephonella and Hydrogenothermus. The comparison between clone libraries and DGGE showed similar patterns of distribution of different Aquificales whereas results differed for the enrichment cultures that were retrieved. However, the use of cultivation-based and -independent methods did provide complementary phylogenetic diversity overview of the Aquificales in these systems. Together, this survey revealed that the ELSC/VFR contains some of the largest diversity of Aquificales ever reported at a deep-sea vent area, that the diversity patterns are tied to the geography and geochemistry of the system, and that this geochemical diverse back-arc basin may harbor new members of the Aquificales.",We thank the crew of the R/V Melville and the ROV Jason II for their assistance in obtaining the samples.

Community-level interactions may also influence macroevolutionary patterns of coevolution, such as cospeciation, but this hypothesis has received little attention. We studied two groups of ecologically similar feather lice (Phthiraptera: Ischnocera) that differ in their patterns of association with a single group of hosts. The two groups, ""body lice"" and ""wing lice,"" are both parasites of pigeons and doves (Columbiformes). Body lice are more host-specific and show greater population genetic structure than wing lice. The macroevolutionary history of body lice also parallels that of their columbiform hosts more closely than does the evolutionary history of wing lice. The closer association of body lice with hosts, compared with wing lice, can be explained if body lice are less capable of switching hosts than wing lice. Wing lice sometimes disperse phoretically on parasitic flies (Diptera: Hippoboscidae), but body lice seldom engage in this behavior. We tested the hypothesis that wing lice switch host species more often than body lice, and that the difference is governed by phoresis. Our results show that, where flies are present, wing lice switch to novel host species in sufficient numbers to establish viable populations on the new host. Body lice do not switch hosts, even where flies are present. Thus, differences in the coevolutionary history of wing and body lice can be explained by differences in host-switching, mediated by a member of the broader parasite community.","We thank Joe Atkin, Craig Benkman, Kurtis Birch, Stuart Howe, Kevin Johnson, Marcy Lloyd, Jael Malenke, Doug Neilson, David Slager, and Kevin Wilding for help with data collection and for comments on previous versions of the manuscript; Sarah Bush for comments and assistance with the figures; and E.

The strong impacts of these species are often attributed to their high demographic success. While the importance of enemy release in facilitating invasions has often been emphasized, few studies have addressed the role of parasites in the invasive range in controlling demographic success of potential invaders. Here we examine whether a trematode parasite (Microphallus spp.) can contribute to previously documented alternate states in the abundance of invasive rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) in north temperate lakes in Wisconsin, USA. Microphallus infect O. rusticus after emerging from their first intermediate host, a hydrobiid snail. As previously documented, O. rusticus reduce densities of hydrobiid snails through direct predation and destruction of macrophyte habitat. Therefore, if Microphallus substantially reduce O. rusticus fitness, these parasites may reinforce a state of low crayfish abundance, and, at the other extreme, abundant crayfish may repress these parasites, reinforcing a state of high crayfish abundance. From samples collected from 109 sites in 16 lakes, we discovered (1) a positive relationship between crayfish infection intensity and hydrobiid snail abundance, (2) a negative relationship between parasite prevalence and crayfish abundance, and (3) a negative relationship between parasite prevalence and crayfish population growth. With experiments, we found that infection with Microphallus reduced foraging behavior and growth in O. rusticus, which may be the mechanisms responsible for the population reductions we observed. Overall results are consistent with the hypothesis that Microphallus contributes to alternate states in the abundance and impacts of O. rusticus.","We would like to thank C.

We predicted that urbanization would impact bacterial community composition, but that stream water column bacterial communities would be most strongly linked to urbanization at a watershed-scale, as measured by impervious cover, while sediment bacterial communities would correlate with environmental conditions at the scale of stream reaches. To test this hypothesis, we determined bacterial community composition in the water column and sediment of headwater streams located across a gradient of watershed impervious cover using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Alpha diversity metrics did not show a strong response to catchment urbanization, but beta diversity was significantly related to watershed impervious cover with significant differences also found between water column and sediment samples. Samples grouped primarily according to habitat-water column vs. sediment-with a significant response to watershed impervious cover nested within each habitat type. Compositional shifts for communities in urbanized streams indicated an increase in taxa associated with human activity including bacteria from the genus Polynucleobacter, which is widespread, but has been associated with eutrophic conditions in larger water bodies. Another indicator of communities in urbanized streams was an OTU from the genus Gallionella, which is linked to corrosion of water distribution systems. To identify changes in bacterial community interactions, bacterial co-occurrence networks were generated from urban and forested samples. The urbanized co-occurrence network was much smaller and had fewer co-occurrence events per taxon than forested equivalents, indicating a loss of keystone taxa with urbanization. Our results suggest that urbanization has significant impacts on the community composition of headwater streams, and suggest that processes driving these changes in urbanized water column vs. sediment environments are distinct.","Our thanks to Lora Harris, K.

Emergent network properties have been indicated to reflect the dominant mode of interactions in communities that might be mutualistic (e.g., pollination) or antagonistic (e.g., host-parasitoid communities). Many ecological communities, however, comprise species interactions that are difficult to observe directly. Here, we propose that a comparison of the emergent properties from detail-rich reference communities with known modes of interaction can inform our understanding of detail-sparse focal communities. With this top-down approach, we consider patterns of coexistence between termite species that live as guests in mounds built by other host termite species as a case in point. Termite societies are extremely sensitive to perturbations, which precludes determining the nature of their interactions through direct observations. We perform a literature review to construct two networks representing termite mound cohabitation in a Brazilian savanna and in the tropical forest of Cameroon. We contrast the properties of these cohabitation networks with a total of 197 geographically diverse mutualistic plant-pollinator and antagonistic host-parasitoid networks. We analyze network properties for the networks, perform a principal components analysis (PCA), and compute the Mahalanobis distance of the termite networks to the cloud of mutualistic and antagonistic networks to assess the extent to which the termite networks overlap with the properties of the reference networks. Both termite networks overlap more closely with the mutualistic plant-pollinator communities than the antagonistic host-parasitoid communities, although the Brazilian community overlap with mutualistic communities is stronger. The analysis raises the hypothesis that termite-termite cohabitation networks may be overall mutualistic. More broadly, this work provides support for the argument that cryptic communities may be analyzed via comparison to well-characterized communities.","Acknowledgements We gratefully acknowledge R.

Projections suggest species range shifts in response to climate change modifying environmental suitability and is supported by observational evidence. Both pathogens and their hosts can shift ranges with climate change. We consider how climate change may influence the distribution of the emerging infectious amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a pathogen associated with worldwide amphibian population losses. Using an expanded global Bd database and a novel modeling approach, we examined a broad set of climate metrics to model the Bd-climate niche globally and regionally, then project how climate change may influence Bd distributions. Previous research showed that Bd distribution is dependent on climatic variables, in particular temperature. We trained a machine-learning model (random forest) with the most comprehensive global compilation of Bd sampling records (~5,000 site-level records, mid-2014 summary), including 13 climatic variables. We projected future Bd environmental suitability under IPCC scenarios. The learning model was trained with combined worldwide data (non-region specific) and also separately per region (region-specific). One goal of our study was to estimate of how Bd spatial risks may change under climate change based on the best available data. Our models supported differences in Bd-climate relationships among geographic regions. We projected that Bd ranges will shift into higher latitudes and altitudes due to increased environmental suitability in those regions under predicted climate change. Specifically, our model showed a broad expansion of areas environmentally suitable for establishment of Bd on amphibian hosts in the temperate zones of the Northern Hemisphere. Our projections are useful for the development of monitoring designs in these areas, especially for sensitive species and those vulnerable to multiple threats.","This work was supported by Oregon State University, to GYX and ARB and the U.S. Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station to DHO and GYX.

Iron-oxide mats in acidic (pH 2-4), high-temperature (> 65 °C) springs of Yellowstone National Park contain relatively simple microbial communities and are well-characterized geochemically. Consequently, these communities are excellent model systems for studying the metabolic activity of individual populations and key microbial interactions. The primary goals of the current study were to integrate data collected in situ with in silico calculations across process-scales encompassing enzymatic activity, cellular metabolism, community interactions, and ecosystem biogeochemistry, as well as to predict and quantify the functional limits of autotroph-heterotroph interactions. Metagenomic and transcriptomic data were used to reconstruct carbon and energy metabolisms of an important autotroph (Metallosphaera yellowstonensis) and heterotroph (Geoarchaeum sp. OSPB) from the studied Fe(III)-oxide mat communities. Standard and hybrid elementary flux mode and flux balance analyses of metabolic models predicted cellular- and community-level metabolic acclimations to simulated environmental stresses, respectively. In situ geochemical analyses, including oxygen depth-profiles, Fe(III)-oxide deposition rates, stable carbon isotopes and mat biomass concentrations, were combined with cellular models to explore autotroph-heterotroph interactions important to community structure-function. Integration of metabolic modeling with in situ measurements, including the relative population abundance of autotrophs to heterotrophs, demonstrated that Fe(III)-oxide mat communities operate at their maximum total community growth rate (i.e. sum of autotroph and heterotroph growth rates), as opposed to net community growth rate (i.e. total community growth rate subtracting autotroph consumed by heterotroph), as predicted from the maximum power principle. Integration of multiscale data with ecological theory provides a basis for predicting autotroph-heterotroph interactions and community-level cellular organization.","This study was supported by the National Science Foundation Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) Program (DGE 0654336) and subcontracts (112443, 254840) from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (Richland, WA) to MSU as part of the DOE-BER Foundational Science Focus Area in Microbial Community Design Principles.

Alternatively, they may represent the end product of historical processes acting over long time frames (fundamental niche partitioning). Niche partitioning is often detected by analysing patterns of resource use within communities, but experiments are rarely conducted to test whether patterns of non-overlapping resource use reflect realized or fundamental niche partitioning. We studied a community of restio leafhoppers from the genus Cephalelus and their host plants, the Restionaceae (restios). We used network and experimental approaches to determine whether network modularity (a measure of niche partitioning within local communities) reflects fundamental or realized niche partitioning. Using a weighted modularity index for two party networks (e.g. insect-plant), we determined whether the network of this community is modular (i.e. consists of groups of species interacting strongly, with weak interactions between groups). We also aimed to identify specific Cephalelus - restio modules (groups). Using knowledge of module membership to design experiments, we tested whether Cephalelus species from two different modules, Cephalelus uncinatus and Cephalelus pickeri, prefer and perform better on restios from their own modules vs. restios from other modules. These experiments were performed under controlled conditions, eliminating the influences of competition and predation on host choices. The Cephalelus - restio community was modular, implying niche partitioning. Cephalelus also preferred and performed better on restios from their own modules in the absence of local contemporary factors. Most niche partitioning in the investigated Cephalelus community is not caused by local interactions, and thus, host use patterns represent fundamental niches. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding local community structure in the light of processes extrinsic to the local community context.","We acknowledge Genevieve Theron, Andre Vermeulen and Caroli de Waal for field assistance and several anonymous reviewers for useful comments on the manuscript.

We examined the effects of two linked mutualisms on the population dynamics of a beetle that exhibits outbreak dynamics. One mutualism involves an obligate association between the bark beetle, Dendroctonus frontalis and two mycangial fungi. The second mutualism involves Tarsonemus mites that are phoretic on D. frontalis (“commensal”), and a blue-staining fungus, Ophiostoma minus. The presence of O. minus reduces beetle larval survival (“antagonistic”) by outcompeting beetle-mutualistic fungi within trees yet supports mite populations by acting as a nutritional mutualist. These linked interactions potentially create an interaction system with the form of an endogenous negative feedback loop. We address four hypotheses: (1) Direct negative feedback: Beetles directly increase the abundance of O. minus, which reduces per capita reproduction of beetles. (2) Indirect negative feedback: Beetles indirectly increase mite abundance, which increases O. minus, which decreases beetle reproduction. (3) The effect of O. minus on beetles depends on mites, but mite abundance is independent of beetle abundance. (4) The effect of O. minus on beetles is independent of beetle and mite abundance. High Tarsonemus and O. minus abundances were strongly correlated with the decline and eventual local extinction of beetle populations. Manipulation experiments revealed strong negative effects of O. minus on beetles, but falsified the hypothesis that horizontal transmission of O. minus generates negative feedback. Surveys of beetle populations revealed that reproductive rates of Tarsonemus, O. minus, and beetles covaried in a manner consistent with strong indirect interactions between organisms. Co-occurrence of mutualisms embedded within a community may have stabilizing effects if both mutualisms limit each other. However, delays and/or non-linearities in the interaction systems may result in large population fluctuations.","We thank Matt Babineau, Dan Braden, Julia Brant, Debbie Cronin, Johnny Fryar, Dan Hogan, Karen London, Sharon Martinson, Jason Moan, Chris Steiner, Erich Vallery, Jessica Veysey and Tiina Ylioja for their assistance in the field and laboratory.

For example, Rhodoferax and Geobacter species are acetate-oxidizing Fe(III)-reducers that compete in anoxic subsurface environments and this competition may have an influence on the in situ bioremediation of uranium-contaminated groundwater. Therefore, genome-scale models of Geobacter sulfurreducens and Rhodoferax ferrireducens were used to evaluate how Geobacter and Rhodoferax species might compete under diverse conditions found in a uranium-contaminated aquifer in Rifle, CO. The model predicted that at the low rates of acetate flux expected under natural conditions at the site, Rhodoferax will outcompete Geobacter as long as sufficient ammonium is available. The model also predicted that when high concentrations of acetate are added during in situ bioremediation, Geobacter species would predominate, consistent with field-scale observations. This can be attributed to the higher expected growth yields of Rhodoferax and the ability of Geobacter to fix nitrogen. The modeling predicted relative proportions of Geobacter and Rhodoferax in geochemically distinct zones of the Rifle site that were comparable to those that were previously documented with molecular techniques. The model also predicted that under nitrogen fixation, higher carbon and electron fluxes would be diverted toward respiration rather than biomass formation in Geobacter, providing a potential explanation for enhanced in situ U(VI) reduction in low-ammonium zones. These results show that genome-scale modeling can be a useful tool for predicting microbial interactions in subsurface environments and shows promise for designing bioremediation strategies.","This research was supported by the Office of Science (BER), the US Department of Energy, Cooperative Agreement No. DE-FC02-02ER63446 and Grant No. DE-FG02-07ER64367; this research was also supported by the Canada Foundation for Innovation and the University of Toronto Open Fellowship, as well as the Government of Canada through Genome Canada and the Ontario Genomics Institute (2009-OGI-ABC-1405).

These functional groups represent the nodes of ecological networks. Direct and indirect interactions among them were assessed using partial Mantel tests. Interaction web complexity was quantified using three measures of network structure: connectance, interaction diversity and interaction strength. 3. Compared with high plant diversity plots, interaction webs based on low plant diversity plots showed reduced complexity in terms of total connectance, interaction diversity and mean interaction strength. Plant diversity effects obviously cascade up the food web and modify interactions across all trophic levels. The strongest effects occurred in interactions between adjacent trophic levels (i.e. predominantly trophic interactions), while significant interactions among plant and carnivore functional groups, as well as horizontal interactions (i.e. interactions between functional groups of the same trophic level), showed rather inconsistent responses and were generally rarer. 4. Reduced interaction diversity has the potential to decrease and destabilize ecosystem processes. Therefore, we conclude that the loss of basal producer species leads to more simple structured, less and more loosely connected species assemblages, which in turn are very likely to decrease ecosystem functioning, community robustness and tolerance to disturbance. Our results suggest that the functioning of the entire ecological community is critically linked to the diversity of its component plants species.","The Jena Experiment has been funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, Wi 1601/4‐1,‐2, FOR 456), with additional support from the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena and the Max Planck Society, and the trait data base to classify functional groups has been engendered as part of another DFG project (VO 795/3‐1).

Five hundred and ninety 6-inch diameter intact plant plugs of Vallisneria were collected from the LSJR in March 2003 and transported to US Geological Survey mesocosm facilities in Lafayette, LA, USA. A 3×3 experimental design consisting of three nutrient levels (control, 1/3 control and 3× control) and three salinity pulsing regimes (no pulse, 1-pulse at 18 ppt and 2-pulse at 12 and 18 ppt) was implemented with three replicates per treatment for a total of 27 experimental tanks. Salinity pulsing significantly reduced all measured Vallisneria growth parameters including above- and below-ground biomass, areal productivity and leaf area index. Nutrient levels had little effect on plants subjected to salinity pulses, but in non-salinity pulse treatments we observed higher mean macrophyte biomass in the low-nutrient loading treatments. Macroalgal components (epiphytes and surface algal mats) were not significantly different ( p=0.2998 and p=0.2444, respectively), but water column chlorophyll a (phytoplankton) was significantly higher ( p<0.0001) in all salinity pulse treatments except for the 1-pulse, low-nutrient treatment. A single salinity pulse at 18 ppt resulted in 22% pot mortality and two consecutive pulses of 18 and 12 ppt resulted in an additional 14% mortality. Individual leaves and ramets lost 59.7% and 67.8%, respectively, in the combined salinity pulse treatments. Nutrient loading tends to have a long-term effect on Vallisneria through complex community interactions while salinity pulsing frequency and intensity has an immediate and direct influence on growth and distribution.","We are very grateful to Dean Dobberfuhl, Michelle Jeansonne and Dean Campbell for their role in coordinating our efforts with the District and serving as our contacts for this project.

However, it is not understood how this genotypic and chemical diversity is ecologically maintained. While secondary metabolites are known to mediate signaling and warfare among strains, no systematic measurement of the resulting interaction networks has been available. We developed a high-throughput platform to measure all pairwise interactions among 64 Streptomyces strains isolated from several individual grains of soil. We acquired more than 10,000 time-lapse movies of colony development of each isolate on media containing compounds produced by each of the other isolates. We observed a rich set of such sender-receiver interactions, including inhibition and promotion of growth and aerial mycelium formation. The probability that two random isolates interact is balanced; it is neither close to zero nor one. The interactions are not random: the distribution of the number of interactions per sender is bimodal and there is enrichment for reciprocity--if strain A inhibits or promotes B, it is likely that B also inhibits or promotes A. Such reciprocity is further enriched in strains derived from the same soil grain, suggesting that it may be a property of coexisting communities. Interactions appear to evolve rapidly: isolates with identical 16S rRNA sequences can have very different interaction patterns. A simple eco-evolutionary model of bacteria interacting through antibiotic production shows how fast evolution of production and resistance can lead to the observed statistical properties of the network. In the model, communities are evolutionarily unstable--they are constantly being invaded by strains with new sets of interactions. This combination of experimental and theoretical observations suggests that diverse Streptomyces communities do not represent a stable ecological state but an intrinsically dynamic eco-evolutionary phenomenon.","We would like to thank Remy Chait, Morten Ernebjerg, Nicholas Stroustrup, Pamela Yeh and Jean-Baptiste Michel for collaboration on setting up the scanner system, Ivan G.

Yet, most of our current understanding of snow pack environments, specifically microbial activity and community interaction, is limited to the main microbial growing season during spring ablation. At present, little is known about microbial activity and its influence on nutrient cycling during the subfreezing temperatures and 24-h darkness of the polar winter. Here, we examined microbial dynamics in a simulated cold (-5°C), dark snow pack to determine polar winter season microbial activity and its dependence on critical nutrients. Snow collected from Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard was incubated in the dark over a 5-week period with four different nutrient additions, including glacial mineral particles, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) and a combined treatment of DIN plus DIP. Data indicate a consumption of dissolved inorganic nutrients, particularly DIN, by heterotrophic communities, suggesting a potential nitrogen limitation, contradictory to phosphorus limitations found in most aquatic environments. 16S amplicon sequencing also reveal a clear difference in microbial community composition in the particulate mineral treatment compared to dissolved nutrient treatments and controls, suggesting that certain species of heterotrophs living within the snow pack are more likely to associate with particulates. Particulate phosphorus analyses indicate a potential ability of heterotrophic communities to access particulate sources of phosphorous, possibly explaining the lack of phosphorus limitation. These findings have importance for understanding microbial activity during the polar winter season and its potential influences on the abundance and bioavailability of nutrients released to surface ice and downstream environments during the ablation season.",We would like to acknowledge and thank the technicians at both the LowTex laboratory in Bristol and the Laboratoire Ampere in Lyon for their help during the experiment and the later analysis of samples.

The aim of this study was to investigate the benefits of increasing the depth of the community analysis in describing and explaining responses to dietary changes. Quantitative PCR, ssu rRNA amplicon based taxa composition, diversity and co-occurrence network analyses were applied to ruminal digesta samples obtained from four multiparous Nordic Red dairy cows fitted with rumen cannulae. The cows received diets with forage:concentrate ratio either 35:65 (diet H) or 65:35 (L), supplemented or not with sunflower oil (SO) (0 or 50 g/kg diet dry matter), supplied in a 4 × 4 Latin square design with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments and four 35-day periods. Digesta samples were collected on days 22 and 24 and combined. QPCR provided a broad picture in which a large fall in the abundance of fungi was seen with SO in the H but not the L diet. Amplicon sequencing showed higher community diversity indices in L as compared to H diets and revealed diet specific taxa abundance changes, highlighting large differences in protozoal and fungal composition. Methanobrevibacter ruminantium and Mbb. gottschalkii dominated archaeal communities, and their abundance correlated negatively with each other. Co-occurrence network analysis provided evidence that no microbial domain played a more central role in network formation, that some minor-abundance taxa were at nodes of highest centrality, and that microbial interactions were diet specific. Networks added new dimensions to our understanding of the diet effect on rumen microbial community interactions.","Study was funded by the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry as part of the GreenDairy Project (Developing Genetic and Nutritional Tools to Mitigate the Environmental Impact of Milk Production; Project No. 2908234).

Although the deep-sea benthos represents one of the world's largest habitats, we lack a firm understanding of the biodiversity and community interactions amongst meiobenthic organisms in this ecosystem. Within this vast environment, key questions concerning the historical genetic structure of species remain a mystery, yet have profound implications for our understanding of global biodiversity and how we perceive and mitigate the impact of environmental change and anthropogenic disturbance. Using a metagenetic approach, we present an assessment of microbial eukaryote communities across depth (shallow water to abyssal) and ocean basins (deep-sea Pacific and Atlantic). Within the 12 sites examined, our results suggest that some taxa can maintain eurybathic ranges and cosmopolitan deep-sea distributions, but the majority of species appear to be regionally restricted. For Operationally Clustered Taxonomic Units (OCTUs) reporting wide distributions, there appears to be a taxonomic bias towards a small subset of taxa in most phyla; such bias may be driven by specific life history traits amongst these organisms. In addition, low genetic divergence between geographically disparate deep-sea sites suggests either a shorter coalescence time between deep-sea regions or slower rates of evolution across this vast oceanic ecosystem. While high-throughput studies allow for broad assessment of genetic patterns across microbial eukaryote communities, intragenomic variation in rRNA gene copies and the patchy coverage of reference databases currently present substantial challenges for robust taxonomic interpretations of eukaryotic data sets.","We thank D.

1265,pub.1031706686,10.1890/06-1946.1,18027761,,,THE GROWTH–PREDATION RISK TRADE‐OFF UNDER A GROWING GAPE‐LIMITED PREDATION THREAT,"Growth is a critical ecological trait because it can determine population demography, evolution, and community interactions. Predation risk frequently induces decreased foraging and slow growth in prey. However, such strategies may not always be favored when prey can outgrow a predator's hunting ability. At the same time, a growing gape-limited predator broadens its hunting ability through time by expanding its gape and thereby creates a moving size refuge for susceptible prey. Here, I explore the ramifications of growing gape-limited predators for adaptive prey growth. A discrete demographic model for optimal foraging/growth strategies was derived under the realistic scenario of gape-limited and gape-unconstrained predation threats. Analytic and numerical results demonstrate a novel fitness minimum just above the growth rate of the gape-limited predator. This local fitness minimum separates a slow growth strategy that forages infrequently and accumulates low but constant predation risk from a fast growth strategy that forages frequently and experiences a high early predation risk in return for lower future predation risk and enhanced fecundity. Slow strategies generally were advantageous in communities dominated by gape-unconstrained predators whereas fast strategies were advantageous in gape-limited predator communities. Results were sensitive to the assumed relationships between prey size and fecundity and between prey growth and predation risk. Predator growth increased the parameter space favoring fast prey strategies. The model makes the testable predictions that prey should not grow at the same rate as their gape-limited predator and generally should grow faster than the fastest growing gape-limited predator. By focusing on predator constraints on prey capture, these results integrate the ecological and evolutionary implications of prey growth in diverse predator communities and offer an explanation for empirical growth patterns previously viewed to be anomalies.","I thank D.

Current understanding is that particle composition, structure and surface properties, determined mostly by the forming organisms and organic matter, dictate initial microbial colonization and the subsequent rapid succession events taking place as organic matter lability and nutrient content change with microbial degradation. We applied a transcriptomic approach to assess the role of stochastic events on initial microbial colonization of particles. Furthermore, we asked whether gene expression corroborates rapid changes in carbon-quality. Commonly used size fractionated filtration averages thousands of particles of different sizes, sources, and ages. To overcome this drawback, we used replicate samples consisting each of 3-4 particles of identical source and age and further evaluated the consequences of averaging 10-1000s of particles. Using flow-through rolling tanks we conducted long-term experiments at near in situ conditions minimizing the biasing effects of closed incubation approaches often referred to as ""the bottle-effect."" In our open flow-through rolling tank system, however, active microbial communities were highly heterogeneous despite an identical particle source, suggesting random initial colonization. Contrasting previous reports using closed incubation systems, expression of carbon utilization genes didn't change after 1 week of incubation. Consequently, we suggest that in nature, changes in particle-associated community related to carbon availability are much slower (days to weeks) due to constant supply of labile, easily degradable organic matter. Initial, random particle colonization seems to be subsequently altered by multiple organismic interactions shaping microbial community interactions and functional dynamics. Comparative analysis of thousands particles pooled togethers as well as pooled samples suggests that mechanistic studies of microbial dynamics should be done on single particles. The observed microbial heterogeneity and inter-organismic interactions may have important implications for evolution and biogeochemistry in aquatic systems.",We acknowledge the technical support of Solvig Pinnow.,"Funding.

Subarctic freshwaters are sentinels for understanding both stressors because the effects of climate change are disproportionately strong at high latitudes and invasion of temperate species is prevalent. Here, we summarize the environmental effects of climate change and illustrate the ecological responses of freshwater fishes to these effects, spanning individual, population, community and ecosystem levels. Climate change is modifying hydrological cycles across atmospheric, terrestrial and aquatic components of subarctic ecosystems, causing increases in ambient water temperature and nutrient availability. These changes affect the individual behavior, habitat use, growth and metabolism, alter population spawning and recruitment dynamics, leading to changes in species abundance and distribution, modify food web structure, trophic interactions and energy flow within communities and change the sources, quantity and quality of energy and nutrients in ecosystems. Increases in temperature and its variability in aquatic environments underpin many ecological responses; however, altered hydrological regimes, increasing nutrient inputs and shortened ice cover are also important drivers of climate change effects and likely contribute to context-dependent responses. Species invasions are a complex aspect of the ecology of climate change because the phenomena of invasion are both an effect and a driver of the ecological consequences of climate change. Using subarctic freshwaters as an example, we illustrate how climate change can alter three distinct aspects of species invasions: (1) the vulnerability of ecosystems to be invaded, (2) the potential for species to spread and invade new habitats, and (3) the subsequent ecological effects of invaders. We identify three fundamental knowledge gaps focused on the need to determine (1) how environmental and landscape characteristics influence the ecological impact of climate change, (2) the separate and combined effects of climate and non-native invading species and (3) the underlying ecological processes or mechanisms responsible for changes in patterns of biodiversity.",Acknowledgments We thank Allen Curry and seven referees for useful suggestions that stimulated improvements to the structure of this manuscript.

Western Atlantic populations of the bryozoan Bugula neritina vary in the palatability of their larvae to predators: individuals south of Cape Hatteras produce chemical deterrents to fish predators that are absent in more northern individuals. We use mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase c subunit I (COI) sequences to show that the differences in palatability between populations correlate with the geographical distributions of two cryptic species within B. neritina. Furthermore, these cryptic species differ in their associations with bacteria that may confer chemical resistance to predation. Small subunit rRNA primers specific to a subset of gamma-proteobacteria amplified only the bacterium Endobugula sertula from the southern cryptic species. Endobugula sertula produces a family of chemical compounds (bryostatins) that may deter predators of its animal host. In contrast, the same primers amplified an array of gamma-proteobacteria from the unprotected northern cryptic bryozoan species, but never E. sertula. In combination, these findings suggest that the geographical variation in palatability observed in the larvae of B. neritina is not the result of local adaptation of a single species to regions of differing predation pressure, but rather results from the comparison of cryptic species that differ in the presence or absence of a bacterium that may provide protection against predators. The ability to identify the cryptic Bugula species and their differing relationships with bacterial associates provides an example of the important role molecular techniques may play in addressing ecological questions.","Specimens were graciously provided by Greg Boland, Kevin Krajick, Nicole Lopanik, Frank Maturo of the University of Florida Marine Laboratory, Melanie Mead, Barbara Shoplock, Jay Stachowicz, Cheryl Swanson, Jeff Terwin, Linda Walters and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute.

However, most of this work has focused on increasing temperature, and still little is known about how the variation in temperature extremes will affect community dynamics. We used the model aquatic community held within the leaves of the carnivorous plant, Sarracenia purpurea, to test how food web dynamics will be affected by high temperature variation. We tested the community response of the first (bacterial density), second (protist diversity and composition), and third trophic level (predator mortality), and measured community respiration. We collected early and late successional stage inquiline communities from S. purpurea from two North American and two European sites with similar average July temperature. We then created a common garden experiment in which replicates of these communities underwent either high or normal daily temperature variation, with the average temperature equal among treatments. We found an impact of temperature variation on the first two, but not on the third trophic level. For bacteria in the high-variation treatment, density experienced an initial boost in growth but then decreased quickly through time. For protists in the high-variation treatment, alpha-diversity decreased faster than in the normal-variation treatment, beta-diversity increased only in the European sites, and protist community composition tended to diverge more in the late successional stage. The mortality of the predatory mosquito larvae was unaffected by temperature variation. Community respiration was lower in the high-variation treatment, indicating a lower ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight clear impacts of temperature variation. A more mechanistic understanding of the effects that temperature, and especially temperature variation, will have on community dynamics is still greatly needed.","We would like to warmly thank Dominique Gravel for the use of his laboratory at the University of Québec in Rimouski.

In the present study, 13 sites in Taihu Lake were selected to study the differences of co-occurrence patterns and niches occupied between the FL and PA bacterial communities using correlation-based network analysis. The results show that both FL and PA bacterial community networks were non-random and significant differences of the network indexes (average path length, clustering coefficient, modularity) were found between the two groups. Furthermore, the PA bacterial community network consisted of more correlations between fewer OTUs, as well as higher average degree, making it more complex. The results of observed (O) to random (R) ratios of intra- or inter-phyla connections indicate more relationships such as cross-feeding, syntrophic, mutualistic, or competitive relationships in the PA bacterial community network. We also found that four OTUs (OTU00074, OTU00755, OTU00079, and OTU00454), which all had important influences on the nutrients cyclings, played different roles in the two networks as connectors or module hubs. Analysis of the relationships between the module eigengenes and environmental variables demonstrated that bacterial groups of the two networks favored quite different environmental conditions. These findings further confirmed the different ecological functions and niches occupied by the FL and PA bacterial communities in the aquatic ecosystem.","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41571108 and 41671078), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China (BK20151614), the National Key Technology R&amp;D Program (2015BAD13B01), the Special Fund of State Key Laboratory of Hydrology-Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering (20145027312, 20155019012), and Qing Lan Project of Jiangsu Province, and KVH was supported through a US National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship under Grant No. 1650686.",,Microbial Ecology,,Springer Nature,"0095-3628, 1432-184X","Bacteria; Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; Biodiversity; Cluster Analysis; DNA, Bacterial; Ecosystem; Environment; Lakes; Microbial Interactions; Microbiota; Phylogeny; Species Specificity",2018-01-09,2018,2018-01-09,2018-08,76,2,303-313,Closed,Article,"Xu, Huimin; Zhao, Dayong; Huang, Rui; Cao, Xinyi; Zeng, Jin; Yu, Zhongbo; Hooker, Katherine V.; Hambright, K.

However, in conventional methods, such as plaque assay, target host strains must be isolated, although almost all environmental prokaryotes are recalcitrant to cultivation. Here, we introduce a novel phage host range evaluation method using fluorescently labeled phages (the FLP method), which consists of the following four steps: (i) Fluorescently labeled phages are added to a microbial consortium, and host cells are infected and fluorescently labeled. (ii) Fluorescent cells are sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. (iii) 16S rRNA gene sequences retrieved from sorted cells are analyzed, and specific oligonucleotide probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) are designed. (iv) Cells labeled with both fluorescently labeled phage and FISH probe are identified as host cells. To verify the feasibility of this method, we used T4 phage and Escherichia coli as a model. We first used nucleic acid stain reagents for phage labeling; however, the reagents also stained non-host cells. Next, we employed the Click-iT EdU (5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine) assay kit from Invitrogen for phage labeling. Using EdU-labeled T4 phage, we could specifically detect E. coli cells in a complex microbial consortium from municipal sewage. We also confirmed that FISH could be applied to the infected E. coli cells. These results suggest that this FLP method using the EdU assay kit is a useful method for evaluating phage host range and may have a potential application for various types of phages, even if their prokaryotic hosts are currently unculturable.","We thank Masaru Kawato and Yuto Yashiro for help with flow cytometry techniques; Norika Meguro, Hiromi Kazama, and Masayuki Ehara for the help with 16S rRNA gene analysis; Drs.

Host-pathogen interactions are influenced by community composition, landscape structure, and environmental factors. Explaining prevalence patterns requires an understanding of how local determinants of infection, such as community composition, are mediated by landscape characteristics and regional-scale environmental drivers. Here we investigate the role of local community interactions and the effects of landscape structure on the dynamics of barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses (B/CYDV) in the open meadows of the Cascade Mountains of Oregon. B/CYDV is an aphid-transmitted, generalist pathogen of over 100 wild and cultivated grass species. We used variance components analysis and model selection techniques to partition the sources of variation in B/CYDV prevalence and to determine which abiotic and biotic factors influence host-pathogen interactions in a Cascades meadowsystem. B/CYDV prevalence in Cascades meadows varied by host species identity, with a significantly higher proportion of infected Festuca idahoensis individuals than Elymus glaucus or Bromus carinatus. Although there was significant variation in prevalence among host species and among meadows in the same meadow complex, there was no evidence of any significant variation in prevalence among different meadow complexes at a larger spatial scale. Variation in prevalence among meadows was primarily associated with the local community context (host identity, the relative abundance of different host species, and host species richness) and the physical landscape attributes of the meadow. These results highlight the importance of local host community composition, mediated by landscape characteristics such as meadow aspect, as a determinant of the spatial pattern of infection of a multi-host pathogen.","We thank Charles Mitchell for providing access to lab space and equipment and Marty Dekkers for technical assistance with the viral assays.

Fewer still have considered whether results from one geographic region can be applied to other regions, given the degree of community change over large biogeographic gradients. We assembled, in one field site, three types of macroinvertebrate communities within water-filled bromeliads. Two represented food webs containing both a fast filter feeder-microbial and slow detritivore energy channels found in Costa Rica and Puerto Rico, and one represented the structurally simpler food webs in French Guiana, which only contained the fast filter feeder-microbial channel. We manipulated the amount and distribution of rain entering bromeliads and examined how food web structure mediated ecosystem responses to changes in the quantity and temporal distribution of precipitation. Food web structure affected the survival of functional groups in general and ecosystem functions such as decomposition and the production of fine particulate organic matter. Ecosystem processes were more affected by decreased precipitation than were the abundance of micro-organisms and metazoans. In our experiments, the sensitivity of the ecosystem to precipitation change was primarily revealed in the food web dominated by the single filter feeder-microbial channel because other top-down and bottom-up processes were weak or absent. Our results show stronger effects of food web structure than precipitation change per se on the functioning of bromeliad ecosystems. Consequently, we predict that ecosystem function in bromeliads throughout the Americas will be more sensitive to changes in the distribution of species, rather than to the direct effects caused by changes in precipitation.","We thank the Editor, Ken Wilson, Birgit Lang and two anonymous reviewers for their comments which greatly improved the manuscript.

In the dung, these residues cause a range of well-studied lethal and sub-lethal effects, the magnitudes of which vary with the compound used, mode of administration and concentration, and the insect species in question. Particular concern has been associated with the use of macrocyclic lactones in this context. Loss of insect colonizers may delay pat decomposition, but field studies report contrasting results that reflect confounding factors such as weather conditions, pat moisture content, pat location, time of year and dung insect species phenologies. The question of fundamental concern is whether the impacts seen in experimental or laboratory studies are likely to have a functional impact on insect populations, community interactions and the economically important process of dung decomposition. Recent studies which have attempted to address these wider, landscape-level impacts in temperate ecosystems are reviewed here. These show that the extent to which chemical residues may have any sustained ecological impact will depend on both a range of farm management factors, such as the temporal and spatial patterns of chemical use, the number of animals treated and the choice of active ingredient, and a range of insect-related factors, such as abundance, population dynamics and dispersal rates. However, they also demonstrate that considerable uncertainty remains about the likely extent of such effects and that current data are insufficient to support firm conclusions regarding sustained pasture-level effects. More large-scale, longterm field experiments are required, particularly in relation to insect dispersal and functional interactions within the dung insect community.",,,Medical and Veterinary Entomology,,Wiley,"0269-283X, 1365-2915",Animals; Antiparasitic Agents; Cattle; Environmental Pollutants; Feces; Lactones,2011-10-19,2011,2011-10-19,2012-03,26,1,1-8,All OA; Bronze,Article,"WALL, R.; BEYNON, S.","WALL, R.

The specialized gut symbiont Snodgrassella alvi has codiversified with honeybees (Apis mellifera) and bumblebees (Bombus) for millions of years. Snodgrassella alvi strains are nearly identical for 16S rRNA gene sequences but have distinct gene repertoires potentially affecting host biology and community interactions. We examined S. alvi strain diversity within and between hosts using deep sequencing both of a single-copy coding gene (minD) and of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. We sampled workers from domestic and feral A. mellifera colonies and wild-caught Bombus representing 14 species. Conventional analyses of community profiles, based on the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, failed to expose most strain variation. In contrast, the minD analysis revealed extensive strain variation within and between host species and individuals. Snodgrassella alvi strain diversity is significantly higher in A. mellifera than in Bombus, supporting the hypothesis that colony founding by swarms of workers enables retention of more diversity than colony founding by a single queen. Most Bombus individuals (72%) are dominated by a single S. alvi strain, whereas most A. mellifera (86%) possess multiple strains. No S. alvi strains are shared between A. mellifera and Bombus, indicating some host specificity. Among Bombus-restricted strains, some are restricted to a single host species or subgenus, while others occur in multiple subgenera. Findings demonstrate that strains diversify both within and between host species and can be highly specific or relatively generalized in their host associations.","We thank Dan Cariveau, Howard Ochman, Jessica Zung, James Thomson, Dee Lusby, Kerry Gentleman, Jerry Shue, Eva Nováková, Peter Gallman and Sooja Nehrlich for help with sample collections and Kim Hammond for maintaining research colonies.

Coralliophila abbreviata are corallivorous gastropods that live and feed on most of the reef-building corals in the tropical western Atlantic and Caribbean. Populations of C. abbreviata associated with the threatened acroporid corals, Acropora palmata and A. cervicornis, display different behavioral, morphological, demographic, and life-history characteristics than those that inhabit other coral host taxa, indicating that host-specific selective forces may be acting on C. abbreviata. Here, we used newly developed polymorphic microsatellite loci and mitochondrial cytochrome b sequence data to assess the population genetic structure, connectivity, and demographic history of C. abbreviata populations from three coral host taxa (A. palmata, Montastraea spp., Mycetophyllia spp.) and six geographic locations across the Caribbean. Analysis of molecular variance provided some evidence of weak and possibly geographically variable host-associated differentiation but no evidence of differentiation among sampling locations or major oceanographic regions, suggesting high gene flow across the Caribbean. Phylogenetic network and bayesian clustering analyses supported a hypothesis of a single panmictic population as individuals failed to cluster by host or sampling location. Demographic analyses consistently supported a scenario of population expansion during the Pleistocene, a time of major carbonate reef development in the region. Although further study is needed to fully elucidate the interactive effects of host-associated selection and high gene flow in this system, our results have implications for local and regional community interactions and impact of predation on declining coral populations.","This project was funded by the NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program via the Southeast Fisheries Science Center and grants NA07NMF4630096 to LJ and NSF OCE 0550294 to IBB.

Perturbations that affect microbial communities residing on animals can lead to dysbiosis, a change in the functional relationship, often associated with disease. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a fungal pathogen of amphibians, has been responsible for catastrophic amphibian population declines around the globe. Amphibians harbor a diverse cutaneous microbiome, including some members which are known to be antagonistic to Bd (anti-Bd). Anti-Bd microorganisms facilitate the ability of some frog populations to persist in the presence of Bd, where other populations that lack anti-Bd microorganisms have declined. Research suggests disease-antagonistic properties of the microbiome may be a function of microbial community interactions, rather than individual bacterial species. Conservation efforts have identified amphibian-associated bacteria that exhibit anti-fungal properties for use as ‘probiotics’ on susceptible amphibian populations. Probiotic application, usually with a single bacterial species, may benefit from a greater understanding of amphibian species-specific microbiome responses to disturbances (e.g. dysbiosis vs. recovery). We assessed microbiome responses to two microbial disturbance events over multiple time points.ResultsExposing Lithobates sphenocephalus (southern leopard frog) adults to the biopesticidal bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis, followed by exposure to the fungal pathogen Bd, did not have long term impacts on the microbiome. After initial shifts, microbial communities recovered and returned to a state that resembled pre-disturbance.ConclusionsOur results indicate microbial communities on L. sphenocephalus are robust and resistant to permanent shifts from some disturbances. This resiliency of microbial communities may explain why L. sphenocephalus is not experiencing the population declines from Bd that impacts many other species. Conservation efforts may benefit from studies outlining amphibian species-specific microbiome responses to disturbances (e.g. dysbiosis vs. recovery). If microbial communities on a threatened amphibian species are unlikely to recover following a disturbance, additional measures may be implemented to ameliorate the impacts of physical and chemical stressors on host-associated microbial communities.","The authors would like to thank the following for providing helpful feedback and logistical support of this research: LK Reinert, LA Rollins-Smith, S Shin, and The Center for Biodiversity Research at The University of Memphis.

While observational data from systematic camera arrays have informed inferences on the spatiotemporal outcomes of predator-prey interactions, the capacity for observational studies to identify mechanistic drivers of species interactions is limited. Experimental study designs that utilize camera traps uniquely allow for testing hypothesized mechanisms that drive predator and prey behaviour, incorporating environmental realism not possible in the laboratory while benefiting from the distinct capacity of camera traps to generate large datasets from multiple species with minimal observer interference. However, such pairings of camera traps with experimental methods remain underutilized. We review recent advances in the experimental application of camera traps to investigate fundamental mechanisms underlying predator-prey ecology and present a conceptual guide for designing experimental camera trap studies. Only 9% of camera trap studies on predator-prey ecology in our review use experimental methods, but the application of experimental approaches is increasing. To illustrate the utility of camera trap-based experiments using a case study, we propose a study design that integrates observational and experimental techniques to test a perennial question in predator-prey ecology: how prey balance foraging and safety, as formalized by the risk allocation hypothesis. We discuss applications of camera trap-based experiments to evaluate the diversity of anthropogenic influences on wildlife communities globally. Finally, we review challenges to conducting experimental camera trap studies. Experimental camera trap studies have already begun to play an important role in understanding the predator-prey ecology of free-living animals, and such methods will become increasingly critical to quantifying drivers of community interactions in a rapidly changing world. We recommend increased application of experimental methods in the study of predator and prey responses to humans, synanthropic and invasive species, and other anthropogenic disturbances.","This paper is the output of a working group formed during the 2018 Gordon Research Conference on Predator–Prey Interactions in Ventura, CA.

The present study investigates the microbial diversity in the coastal environments of Alappuzha, India, where upwelling and mud banks co-exist. Water samples were collected from three stations, M1, M2, and M3, on a weekly basis to estimate the physico-chemical parameters and microbial abundance (MA). Presence of cold waters (< 26 °C) with high nitrate (6–8 µM) and low dissolved oxygen (5 µM) in the sub surface waters during monsoon (M) confirmed the presence of upwelling at all the three stations. Simultaneously, presence of unusually calm waters was seen at M2 alone during M indicating the formation of mud banks. The microbial diversity was determined from three stations, with distinct oceanographic conditions (M1: coastal reference station with only upwelling, M2: mud banks + upwelling, and M3: offshore reference station with only upwelling). The water samples were collected during two seasons, pre-monsoon (April) and M (July) and analysed using 16S rRNA-based Illumina high-throughput metagenomic sequencing. Proteobacteria was the most dominant phyla, followed by Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia in order, with variations in their relative abundance spatially and seasonally. Though the MA increased during M at all the stations, the relative abundance of most of the bacterial phyla except Proteobacteria decreased during M season. Interestingly, most of the sequences at M2 during mud banks were unclassified at the class level indicating the presence of unique microbial populations in this station. Prediction of metabolic activity revealed ammonia oxidation, nitrite reduction, sulphate reduction, xylan degradation, dehalogenation, chitin degradation, etc. as important functions. The metabolic activity throws light on the role of microbes in this environment thereby providing a system-scale perspective of microbial community interactions.","The authors are grateful to the Director, NIO, Goa and Scientist-in-charge, CSIR-NIO (RC), Kochi for their support and advice.

1214,pub.1127148155,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139020,32498175,,,Phytobeneficial bacteria improve saline stress tolerance in Vicia faba and modulate microbial interaction network,"Increased global warming, caused by climate change and human activities, will seriously hinder plant development, such as increasing salt concentrations in soils, which will limit water availability for plants. To ensure optimal plant growth under such changing conditions, microorganisms that improve plant growth and health must be integrated into agricultural practices. In the present work, we examined the fate of Vicia faba microbiota structure and interaction network upon inoculation with plant-nodulating rhizobia (Rhizobium leguminosarum RhOF125) and non-nodulating strains (Paenibacillus mucilaginosus BLA7 and Ensifer meliloti RhOL1) in the presence (or absence) of saline stress. Inoculated strains significantly improved plant tolerance to saline stress, suggesting either a direct or indirect effect on the plant response to such stress. To determine the structure of microbiota associated with V. faba, samples of the root-adhering soil (RAS), and the root tissues (RT) of seedlings inoculated (or not) with equal population size of RhOF125, BLA7 and RhOL1 strains and grown in the presence (or absence) of salt, were used to profile the microbial composition by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The inoculation did not show a significant impact on the composition of the RT microbiota or RAS microbiota. The saline stress shifted the RAS microbiota composition, which correlated with a decrease in Enterobacteriaceae and an increase in Sphingobacterium, Chryseobacterium, Stenotrophomonas, Agrobacterium and Sinorhizobium. When the microbiota of roots and RAS are considered together, the interaction networks for each treatment are quite different and display different key populations involved in community assembly. These findings indicate that upon seed inoculation, community interaction networks rather than their composition may contribute to helping plants to better tolerate environmental stresses. The way microbial populations interfere with each other can have an impact on their functions and thus on their ability to express the genes required to help plants tolerate stresses.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

1214,pub.1045113274,10.1016/j.gene.2015.10.034,26526132,,,Metagenomic studies of the Red Sea,"Metagenomics has significantly advanced the field of marine microbial ecology, revealing the vast diversity of previously unknown microbial life forms in different marine niches. The tremendous amount of data generated has enabled identification of a large number of microbial genes (metagenomes), their community interactions, adaptation mechanisms, and their potential applications in pharmaceutical and biotechnology-based industries. Comparative metagenomics reveals that microbial diversity is a function of the local environment, meaning that unique or unusual environments typically harbor novel microbial species with unique genes and metabolic pathways. The Red Sea has an abundance of unique characteristics; however, its microbiota is one of the least studied among marine environments. The Red Sea harbors approximately 25 hot anoxic brine pools, plus a vibrant coral reef ecosystem. Physiochemical studies describe the Red Sea as an oligotrophic environment that contains one of the warmest and saltiest waters in the world with year-round high UV radiations. These characteristics are believed to have shaped the evolution of microbial communities in the Red Sea. Over-representation of genes involved in DNA repair, high-intensity light responses, and osmoregulation were found in the Red Sea metagenomic databases suggesting acquisition of specific environmental adaptation by the Red Sea microbiota. The Red Sea brine pools harbor a diverse range of halophilic and thermophilic bacterial and archaeal communities, which are potential sources of enzymes for pharmaceutical and biotechnology-based application. Understanding the mechanisms of these adaptations and their function within the larger ecosystem could also prove useful in light of predicted global warming scenarios where global ocean temperatures are expected to rise by 1-3°C in the next few decades. In this review, we provide an overview of the published metagenomic studies that were conducted in the Red Sea, and the bio-prospecting potential of the Red Sea microbiota. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of the previous studies and the need for generating a large and representative metagenomic database of the Red Sea to help establish a dynamic model of the Red Sea microbiota.",,,Gene,,Elsevier,"0378-1119, 1879-0038",Biotechnology; Indian Ocean; Metagenomics; Microbiota,2015-10-23,2015,2015-10-23,2016-02,576,2,717-723,All OA; Green,Article,"Behzad, Hayedeh; Ibarra, Martin Augusto; Mineta, Katsuhiko; Gojobori, Takashi","Behzad, Hayedeh (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Computational Bioscience Research Center, Thuwal 23955-6900, Saudi Arabia); Ibarra, Martin Augusto (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Computational Bioscience Research Center, Thuwal 23955-6900, Saudi Arabia); Mineta, Katsuhiko (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Computer, Electrical, and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering Division, Thuwal 23955-6900, Saudi Arabia); Gojobori, Takashi (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Computational Bioscience Research Center, Thuwal 23955-6900, Saudi Arabia; King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division, Thuwal 23955-6900, Saudi Arabia)","Gojobori, Takashi (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology; King Abdullah University of Science and Technology)","Behzad, Hayedeh (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology); Ibarra, Martin Augusto (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology); Mineta, Katsuhiko (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology); Gojobori, Takashi (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology; King Abdullah University of Science and Technology)",King Abdullah University of Science and Technology,grid.45672.32,Jeddah,,Saudi Arabia,,,,,,36,17,1.3,4.08,5,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/10754/581498/1/1-s2.0-S0378111915012421-main.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1045113274,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3107 Microbiology,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,13 Climate Action; 14 Life Below Water

METHODS: A meta-analysis was conducted of published studies from the peer-reviewed literature that reported autumn senescence dates for deciduous trees in the northern hemisphere, encompassing 64 publications with observations ranging from 1931 to 2010.
KEY RESULTS: Among the meteorological measurements examined, October temperatures were the strongest predictors of date of senescence, followed by cooling degree-days, latitude, photoperiod and, lastly, total monthly precipitation, although the strength of the relationships differed between high- and low-latitude sites. Autumn leaf senescence has been significantly more delayed at low (25° to 49°N) than high (50° to 70°N) latitudes across the northern hemisphere, with senescence across high-latitude sites more sensitive to the effects of photoperiod and low-latitude sites more sensitive to the effects of temperature. Delays in leaf senescence over time were stronger in North America compared with Europe and Asia.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that leaf senescence has been delayed over time and in response to temperature, although low-latitude sites show significantly stronger delays in senescence over time than high-latitude sites. While temperature alone may be a reasonable predictor of the date of leaf senescence when examining a broad suite of sites, it is important to consider that temperature-induced changes in senescence at high-latitude sites are likely to be constrained by the influence of photoperiod. Ecosystem-level differences in the mechanisms that control the timing of leaf senescence may affect both plant community interactions and ecosystem carbon storage as global temperatures increase over the next century.","We thank Richard Primack, Michael Hanley and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on earlier drafts of this manuscript.

1214,pub.1100692966,10.1080/00275514.2018.1430439,29580158,,,Quantifying beetle-macrofungal associations in a temperate biodiversity hot spot,"Beetles (Coleoptera) are often among the most abundant and diverse insects that feed on sporocarps of macrofungi, but little is known regarding their relative specialism or generalism in most communities. We surveyed >9000 sporocarps in montane hardwood forest in the Appalachian Mountains (USA) to characterize associations of mycophagous beetles and macrofungi. We used traditional metrics and network analyses to quantify relationships between sporocarp traits (mass, age, persistence, and toughness) and assemblages of adult beetles, drawing from >50 000 beetles collected over two survey years. Strict-sense specificity was rare in these associations: most beetle species were found on multiple fungal genera, and most fungi hosted multiple beetle species. Sporocarp age and fresh mass were positively associated with beetle diversity in fungi with ephemeral sporocarps (here including 12 genera of Agaricales and Russulales), but sporocarp persistence was not. In Polyporales, beetle diversity was greater in softer sporocarps than in tough or woody sporocarps. The increase of beetle diversity in aging sporocarps could not be attributed to increases in sporocarp mass or sampling point in the growing season, suggesting that age-related changes in chemistry or structure may support increasingly diverse beetle communities. Interaction networks differed as a function of sporocarp age, revealing that community-wide measures of generalism (i.e., network connectance) and evenness (i.e., variance in normalized degree) change as sporocarps mature and senesce. Beetles observed on Agaricales and Russulales with more persistent sporocarps had narrower interaction breadth (i.e., were more host-specific) than those on less persistent sporocarps, and beetles on Polyporales with tougher sporocarps had narrower interaction breadth than those on soft sporocarps. In addition to providing a large-scale evaluation of sporocarp use by adult beetles in this temperate biodiversity hot spot, this study shows that characteristics of food organisms are associated with specialism and generalism in interactions relevant to fungal and forest ecology.","We thank T.

However, the effects of plants on microorganisms responsible for N removal are poorly understood. In this study, a three-stage surface flow CW was constructed in a pilot-scale within monospecies stands of Myriophyllum aquaticum to treat swine wastewater. Steady-state conditions were achieved throughout the 600-day operating period, and a high (98.3%) average ammonia removal efficiency under a N loading rate of 9 kg ha-1 d-1 was observed. To determine whether this high efficiency was associated with the performance of active microbes, the abundance, structure, and interactions of microbial community were compared in the unvegetated and vegetated samples. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions showed the abundances of nitrifying genes (archaeal and bacterial amoA) and denitrifying genes (nirS, nirK, and nosZ) were increased significantly by M. aquaticum in the sediments, and the strongest effects were observed for the archaeal amoA (218-fold) and nirS genes (4620-fold). High-throughput sequencing of microbial 16S rRNA gene amplicons showed that M. aquaticum greatly changed the microbial community, and ammonium oxidizers (Nitrosospira and Nitrososphaera), nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (Nitrospira), and abundant denitrifiers including Rhodoplanes, Bradyrhizobium, and Hyphomicrobium, were enriched significantly in the sediments. The results of a canonical correspondence analysis and Mantle tests indicated that M. aquaticum may shift the sediment microbial community by changing the sediment chemical properties. The enriched nitrifiers and denitrifiers were distributed widely in the vegetated sediments, showing positive ecological associations among themselves and other bacteria based on phylogenetic molecular ecological networks.","We thank Scott Lloyd, Ph.D., from Liwen Bianji, Edanz Group China (www.liwenbianji.cn/ac), for editing the English text of this manuscript.","Funding.

Two species of trees were chosen for evaluating herbivory effects: white oak (Quercus alba), a relatively slow-growing shade-tolerant species, and tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), a fast-growing shade-intolerant species. Both are dominants in the Southeastern U.S. forest system selected as a basis for this study. The study focused on four hierarchical levels, covering individual, phenotypic, interspecific, and community interactions. Simulations of herbivory were arrived at by stochastically varying annual incidence that herbivores were present on each simulation plot over a 500-yr period, and by modifying the proportion of energy allocated to either tree growth, or to its defense from herbivore attack. Two hypothetical tree phenotypes were considered, one that allocated specified amounts of energy to herbivore defense mechanisms at all times, and the other that made the allocation only when herbivores were present according to the stochastic determination made for a specific study period. Thus, one phenotype was fixed in its life history strategy; the other was given a facultative strategy where it switched its growth and defense tactics as a function of variation in herbivore presence. The results of the simulations suggest how deciduous forests may respond to long-term variations in the intensity of herbivore stress on two dominant tree species, and show the importance of hierarchical relationships within the community. White oak tended to show a greater sensitivity to interspecific interactions; tulip poplar showed a higher sensitivity to intraspecific interactions. Changes in growth rates associated with the switching strategies (an ultimate factor) were more important in answering variations in productivity than was impact imparted by annual changes in incidence of herbivore presence (a proximate factor) for these two species, although there were important differences in several statistical interactions. While our results suggest that herbivore stress can explain a larger degree of the variation in long-term community dynamics, ecological interactions between herbivore and climate effects must be more closely linked in such long-term studies.",,,Ecological Applications,,Wiley,"1051-0761, 1939-5582",,1992-11-01,1992,1992-11-01,1992-11,2,4,376-386,Closed,Article,"Dyer, M I; Shugart, H H","Dyer, M I (); Shugart, H H ()",,"Dyer, M I (); Shugart, H H ()",,,,,,,,,,,12,1,0.08,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1023012376,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3007 Forestry Sciences; 31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 41 Environmental Sciences",,,,,,A05 Biological Sciences,

Neolithic settlers brought a new set of maternal lineages (mitochondrial DNA), recently well-characterized on the continental road, from the Balkans to West Germany (Rhine River). In the present study, the first mitochondrial DNA data from groups associated with this continental expansion wave located west of the Rhine River has been provided and their genetic affinities with contemporary groups have been discussed.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The mitochondrial DNA analysis of 27 human remains originating from Obernai (5,000-4,400 cal. BC), a necropolis located in French Alsace Region and attributed to Grossgartach, Planig-Friedberg, and Roessen cultures was conducted.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Among the 27 individuals studied, 15 HVR-I sequences and 17 mitochondrial haplogroups could be determined. The analysis of the Obernai gene pool clearly confirmed the genetic homogeneity of Linearbandkeramik (LBK) groups on both sides of the Rhine River. Notably, one N1a sequence found in Obernai is shared with LBK farmers from Central Europe, including one individual from the Flomborn site located approximately 200 km north-east of Obernai. On the whole, data gathered so far showed major genetic influence of the Danubian wave from Transdanubia to Atlantic French Coast, going by Alsace Region. However, the genetic influence of descendants from the Mediterranean Neolithic expansion and the significant hunter-gatherer admixture detected further west in the Paris Basin were not perceived in the Obernai necropolis.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic homogeneity and continuity within LBK groups can be proposed on both sides of the Rhine River for the middle Neolithic groups. Nevertheless, mitochondrial data gathered so far for Neolithic groups from the entire extant French Territory clearly point out the complexity and the variability of Neolithic communities interactions that is worthy of further investigation.","The excavation was conducted according to government agreements n° SRA2011/072, SRA2011/136 and SRA2012/180.

Within a community, different host species often exhibit broad variation in sensitivity to infection and disease. Because such differences can influence the strength and outcome of community interactions, it is essential to understand differential disease patterns and identify the mechanisms responsible. 2. In North American wetlands, amphibian species often exhibit extraordinary differences in the frequency of limb malformations induced by the digenetic trematode, Ribeiroia ondatrae. By coupling field studies with parasite exposure experiments, we evaluated whether such patterns were due to differences in (i) parasite encounter rate, (ii) infection establishment, or (iii) parasite persistence within hosts. 3. Field results underscored the broad variation in malformations and infection between host species; while nearly 60% (n = 618) of emerging American toads exhibited severe limb deformities such as bony triangles, skin webbings and missing limbs, fewer than 4% (n = 251) of Eastern gray treefrogs from the same pond were abnormal. Despite similarities in the phenology and larval development period of these species, they differed sharply in Ribeiroia infection. On average, toads supported 75x more metacercariae than did metamorphic treefrogs. 4. Experimental exposures of larval toads and treefrogs to a realistic range of Ribeiroia cercariae revealed strong differences in the sensitivity of these species to infection; exposed toads suffered elevated mortality (up to 95%), delayed metamorphosis, and severe limb malformations consistent with field observations. Treefrogs, in contrast, exhibited limited mortality and no malformations, regardless of exposure level. Ribeiroia cercariae were substantially less successful in locating and infecting Hyla versicolor larvae. 5. Our results indicate that the observed differences in infection and malformations owe to a lower ability of Ribeiroia cercariae to both find and establish within larval treefrogs, possibly stemming from a heightened immune response to infection. Because Ribeiroia is a highly pathogenic parasite with negative effects on larval and metamorphic amphibian survival, variation in infection resistance among species could have important implications for understanding patterns of species co-occurrence, competition, and community diversity.","We thank Christine Britton for providing egg masses of Hyla versicolor, Daniel Sutherland and Don Larson for conducting frog necropsies, and Tim Kratz and the Trout Lake Research Station for providing logistical support.

Despite this fact, bacterial pathogenesis studies primarily focus on monoculture infections, overlooking how community interactions influence the course of disease. In this study, we used global mutant fitness profiling (transposon sequencing [Tn-seq]) to determine the genetic requirements for the pathogenic bacterium Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans to cause disease when coinfecting with the commensal bacterium Streptococcus gordonii Our results show that S. gordonii extensively alters A. actinomycetemcomitans requirements for virulence factors and biosynthetic pathways during infection. In addition, we discovered that the presence of S. gordonii enhances the bioavailability of oxygen during infection, allowing A. actinomycetemcomitans to shift from a primarily fermentative to a respiratory metabolism that enhances its growth yields and persistence. Mechanistically, respiratory metabolism enhances the fitness of A. actinomycetemcomitans in vivo by increasing ATP yields via central metabolism and creating a proton motive force. Our results reveal that, similar to cross-feeding, where one species provides another species with a nutrient, commensal bacteria can also provide electron acceptors that promote the respiratory growth and fitness of pathogens in vivo, an interaction that we term cross-respiration.
IMPORTANCE: Commensal bacteria can enhance the virulence of pathogens in mixed-species infections. However, knowledge of the mechanisms underlying this clinically relevant phenomenon is lacking. To bridge this gap, we comprehensively determined the genes a pathogen needs to establish coinfection with a commensal. Our findings show that the metabolism of the pathogen is low-energy-yielding in monoinfection, but in coinfection, the commensal improves the fitness of the pathogen by increasing the bioavailability of oxygen, thereby shifting the pathogen toward a high-energy-yielding metabolism. Similar to cross-feeding, this interaction, which we term cross-respiration, illustrates that commensal bacteria can provide electron acceptors that enhance the virulence of pathogens during infection.","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grant R01DE023193 (to M.W. and R.J.L.), R01DE020100 (to M.W. and K.P.R.), and F31DE024931 (to A.S.).

However, relatively little is known about how urbanization influences competitive interactions among mammalian carnivores, particularly related to wild felids. We evaluated interspecific interactions between medium- and large-sized carnivores across a gradient of urbanization and multiple scales. Specifically, we investigated spatial and temporal interactions of bobcats and pumas by evaluating circadian activity patterns, broad-scale seasonal interactions, and fine-scale daily interactions in wildland-urban interface (WUI), exurban residential development, and wildland habitats. Across levels of urbanization, interspecific interactions were evaluated using two-species and single-species occupancy models with data from motion-activated cameras. As predicted, urbanization increased the opportunity for interspecific interactions between wild felids. Although pumas did not exclude bobcats from areas at broad spatial or temporal scales, bobcats responded behaviorally to the presence of pumas at finer scales, but patterns varied across levels of urbanization. In wildland habitat, bobcats avoided using areas for short temporal periods after a puma visited an area. In contrast, bobcats did not appear to avoid areas that pumas recently visited in landscapes influenced by urbanization (exurban development and WUI habitat). In addition, overlap in circadian activity patterns between bobcats and pumas increased in exurban development compared to wildland habitat. Across study areas, bobcats used sites less frequently as the number of puma photographs increased at a site. Overall, bobcats appear to shape their behavior at fine spatial and temporal scales to reduce encounters with pumas, but residential development can potentially alter these strategies and increase interaction opportunities. We explore three hypotheses to explain our results of how urbanization affected interspecific interactions that consider activity patterns, landscape configuration, and animal scent marking. Altered competitive interactions between animals in urbanized landscapes could potentially increase aggressive encounters and the frequency of disease transmission.","Acknowledgments Funding and support were provided by Colorado State University, Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW), Boulder County Parks and Open Space, Boulder City Open Space and Mountain Parks, the Bureau of Land Management, US Forest Service, and grants from the National Science Foundation‐Ecology of Infectious Diseases Program (NSF EF‐0723676; EF‐1413925).

However, the use of starter needs a better understanding of the effect of the interaction between the starter and native microorganisms during alcoholic fermentation. In this study, high-throughput sequencing combined with metabolite analysis was applied to analyze the effect of commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae inoculation on the native fungal community interaction and metabolism during pomegranate wine fermentation. Results showed that there were diverse native fungi in pomegranate juice, including Hanseniaspora uvarum, Hanseniaspora valbyensis, S. cerevisiae, Pichia terricola, and Candida diversa Based on ecological network analysis, we found that S. cerevisiae inoculation transformed the negative correlations into positive correlations among the native fungal communities and decreased the Granger causalities between native yeasts and volatile organic compounds. This might lead to decreased contents of isobutanol, isoamylol, octanoic acid, decanoic acid, ethyl laurate, ethyl acetate, ethyl hexadecanoate, phenethyl acetate, and 2-phenylethanol during fermentation. This study combined correlation and causality analysis to gain a more integrated understanding of microbial interaction and the fermentation process. It provided a new strategy to predict certain behaviors between inoculated and selected microorganisms and those coming directly from the fruit.IMPORTANCE Microbial interactions play an important role in flavor metabolism during traditional food and beverage fermentation. However, we understand little about how selected starters influence interactions among native microorganisms. In this study, we found that S. cerevisiae inoculation changed the interactions and metabolisms of native fungal communities during pomegranate wine fermentation. This study not only suggests that starter inoculation should take into account the positive features of starters but also characterizes the microbial interactions established among the starters and the native communities. It may be helpful to select appropriate starter cultures for winemakers to design different styles of wine.",,,Applied and Environmental Microbiology,,American Society for Microbiology,"0099-2240, 1098-5336",Disaccharides; Fermentation; Fungi; Glucuronates; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Mycobiome; Pomegranate; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Solid Phase Extraction; Wine,2020-11-24,2020,2020-11-24,2020-11-24,86,24,,All OA; Green,Article,"Wang, Xueshan; Ren, Xidong; Shao, Qingqing; Peng, Xiao; Zou, Wenjing; Sun, Zhongguan; Zhang, Lihua; Li, Hehe","Wang, Xueshan (Shandong Engineering Technology Research Center for Pomegranate Deep-Processing, Shandong Comprehensive Development Engineering Laboratory for Pomegranate Resources, College of Food Science and Pharmaceutical Engineering, Zaozhuang University, Zaozhuang, Shandong, China wangxueshan_1987@163.com xyzhehe@126.com.; Beijing Laboratory of Food Quality and Safety, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing, China.); Ren, Xidong (State Key Laboratory of Biobased Material and Green Papermaking, Qilu University of Technology, Shandong Academy of Sciences, Jinan, China.); Shao, Qingqing (Shandong Engineering Technology Research Center for Pomegranate Deep-Processing, Shandong Comprehensive Development Engineering Laboratory for Pomegranate Resources, College of Food Science and Pharmaceutical Engineering, Zaozhuang University, Zaozhuang, Shandong, China.); Peng, Xiao (Shandong Engineering Technology Research Center for Pomegranate Deep-Processing, Shandong Comprehensive Development Engineering Laboratory for Pomegranate Resources, College of Food Science and Pharmaceutical Engineering, Zaozhuang University, Zaozhuang, Shandong, China.); Zou, Wenjing (Shandong Engineering Technology Research Center for Pomegranate Deep-Processing, Shandong Comprehensive Development Engineering Laboratory for Pomegranate Resources, College of Food Science and Pharmaceutical Engineering, Zaozhuang University, Zaozhuang, Shandong, China.); Sun, Zhongguan (Shandong Engineering Technology Research Center for Pomegranate Deep-Processing, Shandong Comprehensive Development Engineering Laboratory for Pomegranate Resources, College of Food Science and Pharmaceutical Engineering, Zaozhuang University, Zaozhuang, Shandong, China.); Zhang, Lihua (Shandong Engineering Technology Research Center for Pomegranate Deep-Processing, Shandong Comprehensive Development Engineering Laboratory for Pomegranate Resources, College of Food Science and Pharmaceutical Engineering, Zaozhuang University, Zaozhuang, Shandong, China.); Li, Hehe (Beijing Laboratory of Food Quality and Safety, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing, China wangxueshan_1987@163.com xyzhehe@126.com.)",,"Wang, Xueshan (Zaozhuang University; Beijing Technology and Business University); Ren, Xidong (); Shao, Qingqing (Zaozhuang University); Peng, Xiao (Zaozhuang University); Zou, Wenjing (Zaozhuang University); Sun, Zhongguan (Zaozhuang University); Zhang, Lihua (Zaozhuang University); Li, Hehe (Beijing Technology and Business University)",Zaozhuang University; Beijing Technology and Business University,grid.460162.7; grid.411615.6,Zaozhuang; Beijing,; ,China; China,National Natural Science Foundation of China,,China,grant.8199854,31701585,6,6,0.73,1.14,6,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7688242,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131480768,31 Biological Sciences; 3106 Industrial Biotechnology,,,,,,"A06 Agriculture, Veterinary and Food Science",

Global exchange and accumulation of alien species caused environmental and economic threats in the introduced ranges. Their invasion success or not in local plant communities is largely depended on the interactions and competitive outcomes with other species and environmental conditions. Here, we tested whether the interactions of nutrient variability and competitor identity influence plant performance, potential invasion success of invasive species and their co-existence with native species. In both greenhouse and field experiment, we subjected three congeneric and naturally co-occurring pairs of invasive alien and native clonal plants in China to different nutrient variability (constant high, multiple pulses and/or single pulse) and competitor identity (intra-specific competitors, native competitors, invasive competitors and both native & invasive competitors). Our results showed that total biomass or the increase of cover of invasive species was significantly larger than those of the native species regardless of competitor identity. Native competitors significantly decreased biomass proportion of native species, but did not affect that of invasive species. The whole community with invasive target species accumulated more total biomass than with native species under multiple pulses nutrient when with the native competitors. Invasive species produced significantly higher biomass proportion than natives under all competitor identity treatments except for native & invasive competitors. Multiple mixed competitors (i.e. native & invasive competitors) decreased the plant performance and dominance of invasive target species, to some extent, thus construction of multi-species competition might facilitate coexistence of native and invasive species in communities. Interactions between native competitors or native & invasive competitors, and nutrient variability play important roles in plant performance and potential invasion success in communities. Multiple invasional interference may have significant implications for the co-existence of invasive and native species, and for management of invasive species.","The authors thank Ai-Ming Cai, Jiang-Hua Liu, Ping Zhang and Rong Yan for help with the experiments.

Our understanding would be enhanced by better accounting for tumor subtype, microbial community interactions, metabolism, and ecology.MethodsWe collected paired colon tumor and normal-adjacent tissue and mucosa samples from 83 individuals who underwent partial or total colectomies for CRC. Mismatch repair (MMR) status was determined in each tumor sample and classified as either deficient MMR (dMMR) or proficient MMR (pMMR) tumor subtypes. Samples underwent 16S rRNA gene sequencing and a subset of samples from 50 individuals were submitted for targeted metabolomic analysis to quantify amino acids and short-chain fatty acids. A PERMANOVA was used to identify the biological variables that explained variance within the microbial communities. dMMR and pMMR microbial communities were then analyzed separately using a generalized linear mixed effects model that accounted for MMR status, sample location, intra-subject variability, and read depth. Genome-scale metabolic models were then used to generate microbial interaction networks for dMMR and pMMR microbial communities. We assessed global network properties as well as the metabolic influence of each microbe within the dMMR and pMMR networks.ResultsWe demonstrate distinct roles for microbes in dMMR and pMMR CRC. Bacteroides fragilis and sulfidogenic Fusobacterium nucleatum were significantly enriched in dMMR CRC, but not pMMR CRC. These findings were further supported by metabolic modeling and metabolomics indicating suppression of B. fragilis in pMMR CRC and increased production of amino acid proxies for hydrogen sulfide in dMMR CRC.ConclusionsIntegrating tumor biology and microbial ecology highlighted distinct microbial, metabolic, and ecological properties unique to dMMR and pMMR CRC. This approach could critically improve our ability to define, predict, prevent, and treat colorectal cancers.","We would first like to thank the patients who volunteered for this study.

Meta‐analysis reveals divergent responses of nocturnal mammals to lunar cycles,"The risk of predation strongly affects mammalian population dynamics and community interactions. Bright moonlight is widely believed to increase predation risk for nocturnal mammals by increasing the ability of predators to detect prey, but the potential for moonlight to increase detection of predators and the foraging efficiency of prey has largely been ignored. Studies have reported highly variable responses to moonlight among species, calling into question the assumption that moonlight increases risk. Here, we conducted a quantitative meta-analysis examining the effects of moonlight on the activity of 59 nocturnal mammal species to test the assumption that moonlight increases predation risk. We examined patterns of lunarphilia and lunarphobia across species in relation to factors such as trophic level, habitat cover preference and visual acuity. Across all species included in the meta-analysis, moonlight suppressed activity. The magnitude of suppression was similar to the presence of a predator in experimental studies of foraging rodents (13.6% and 18.7% suppression, respectively). Contrary to the expectation that moonlight increases predation risk for all prey species, however, moonlight effects were not clearly related to trophic level and were better explained by phylogenetic relatedness, visual acuity and habitat cover. Moonlight increased the activity of prey species that use vision as their primary sensory system and suppressed the activity of species that primarily use other senses (e.g. olfaction, echolocation), and suppression was strongest in open habitat types. Strong taxonomic patterns underlay these relationships: moonlight tended to increase primate activity, whereas it tended to suppress the activity of rodents, lagomorphs, bats and carnivores. These results indicate that visual acuity and habitat cover jointly moderate the effect of moonlight on predation risk, whereas trophic position has little effect. While the net effect of moonlight appears to increase predation risk for most nocturnal mammals, our results highlight the importance of sensory systems and phylogenetic history in determining the level of risk.","C.

Two predominant hypotheses, the ""Dilution Effect"" and the ""Amplification Effect"", predict divergent outcomes with respect to the impact of species diversity. The Dilution Effect predicts that pathogen prevalence will be negatively correlated with increased species diversity, while the Amplification Effect predicts that pathogen prevalence will be positively correlated with diversity. For many host-pathogen systems, the relationship between diversity and pathogen prevalence has not be empirically examined.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We tested the Dilution and Amplification Effect hypotheses by examining the prevalence of Sin Nombre virus (SNV) with respect to diversity of the nocturnal rodent community. SNV is directly transmitted primarily between deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). Using mark-recapture sampling in the Spring and Fall of 2003-2005, we measured SNV prevalence in deer mice at 16 landscape level sites (3.1 hectares each) that varied in rodent species diversity. We explored several mechanisms by which species diversity may affect SNV prevalence, including reduced host density, reduced host persistence, the presence of secondary reservoirs and community composition. We found a negative relationship between species diversity and SNV prevalence in deer mice, thereby supporting the Dilution Effect hypothesis. Deer mouse density and persistence were lower at sites with greater species diversity; however, only deer mouse persistence was positively correlated with SNV prevalence. Pinyon mice (P. truei) may serve as dilution agents, having a negative effect on prevalence, while kangaroo rats (Dipodomys ordii), may have a positive effect on the prevalence of SNV, perhaps through effects on deer mouse behavior.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: While previous studies on host-pathogen systems have found patterns of diversity consistent with either the Dilution or Amplification Effects, the mechanisms by which species diversity influences prevalence have not been investigated. Our study indicates that changes in host persistence, coupled with interspecific interactions, are important mechanisms through which diversity may influence patterns of pathogens. Our results reveal the complexity of rodent community interactions with respect to SNV dynamics.","We thank Dr. Matthew Baylis and two reviewers for insightful comments on this manuscript.

The potential role these interactions have in bloom development and decline are also of particular interest given the ecosystem impacts of algal blooms. We hypothesized that microbial community structure and succession is linked to specific bloom stages, and reflects complex interactions among taxa comprising the phycosphere environment. This investigation used pyrosequencing and correlation approaches to assess patterns and associations among bacteria, archaea, and microeukaryotes during a spring bloom of the dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella. Within the bacterial community, Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were predominant during the initial bloom stage, while Alphaproteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and Actinobacteria were the most abundant taxa present during bloom onset and termination. In the archaea biosphere, methanogenic members were present during the early bloom period while the majority of species identified in the late bloom stage were ammonia-oxidizing archaea and Halobacteriales. Dinoflagellates were the major eukaryotic group present during most stages of the bloom, whereas a mixed assemblage comprising diatoms, green-algae, rotifera, and other microzooplankton were present during bloom termination. Temperature and salinity were key environmental factors associated with changes in bacterial and archaeal community structure, respectively, whereas inorganic nitrogen and inorganic phosphate were associated with eukaryotic variation. The relative contribution of environmental parameters measured during the bloom to variability among samples was 35.3%. Interaction analysis showed that Maxillopoda, Spirotrichea, Dinoflagellata, and Halobacteria were keystone taxa within the positive-correlation network, while Halobacteria, Dictyochophyceae, Mamiellophyceae, and Gammaproteobacteria were the main contributors to the negative-correlation network. The positive and negative relationships were the primary drivers of mutualist and competitive interactions that impacted algal bloom fate, respectively. Functional predictions showed that blooms enhance microbial carbohydrate and energy metabolism, and alter the sulfur cycle. Our results suggest that microbial community structure is strongly linked to bloom progression, although specific drivers of community interactions and responses are not well understood. The importance of considering biotic interactions (e.g., competition, symbiosis, and predation) when investigating the link between microbial ecological behavior and an algal bloom's trajectory is also highlighted.","Special thanks to Judy Kleindinst, Yihua Lyu, Yan Gao, and other members of Dr. Anderson’s laboratory at WHOI for assistance in sample preparation and software use.","Funding.

These fluctuations can be only partially explained by limiting resources. Biotic factors such as herbivores and pathogens also contribute to the control of algal blooms. Here we address the effects of algicidal bacteria on a natural plankton community in an indoor enclosure experiment. The algicidal bacteria, introduced into plankton taken directly from the North Sea during a diatom bloom, caused the rapid decline of the bloom-forming Chaetoceros socialis within only 1 day. The haptophyte Phaeocystis, in contrast, is resistant to the lytic bacteria and could benefit from the removal of the competitor, as indicated by an onset of a bloom in the treated enclosures. This cascading effect caused by the bacterial pathogen accelerated the succession of Phaeocystis, which bloomed with a delay of only several weeks in the in situ waters at Helgoland Roads in the North Sea. The algicidal bacteria can thus modulate the community within the limits of the abiotic and biotic conditions of the local environment. Implications of our findings for plankton ecosystem functioning are discussed.IMPORTANCE Plankton communities change on a seasonal basis in temperate systems, with distinct succession patterns; this is mainly due to algal species that have their optimal timing relative to environmental conditions. We know that bacterial populations are also instrumental in the decay and termination of phytoplankton blooms. Here, we describe algicidal bacteria as modulators of this important species succession. Upon treatment of a natural plankton consortium with an algicidal bacterium, we observed a strong shift in the phytoplankton community structure, compared to controls, resulting in formation of a succeeding Phaeocystis bloom. Blooms of this alga have a substantial impact on global biogeochemical and ecological cycles, as they are responsible for a substantial proportion of primary production during spring in the North Sea. We propose that one of the key factors influencing such community shifts may be algicidal bacteria.","This work was funded by the German Research Foundation within the CRC ChemBioSys (grant CRC1127) and the Jena School for Microbial Communication.

In plant communities, interactions between individuals of different species are expected to generate positive or negative spatial interspecific associations over short distances. Recent studies using individual-based point pattern datasets have concluded that (a) detectable interspecific interactions are generally rare, but (b) are most common in communities with fewer species; and (c) the most abundant species tend to have the highest frequency of interactions. However, it is unclear how the detection of spatial interactions may change with the abundances of each species, or the scale and intensity of interactions. We ask if statistical power is sufficient to explain all three key results.We use a simple two-species model, assuming no habitat associations, and where the abundances, scale and intensity of interactions are controlled to simulate point pattern data. In combination with an approximation to the variance of the spatial summary statistics that we sample, we investigate the power of current spatial point pattern methods to correctly reject the null model of pairwise species independence.We show the power to detect interactions is positively related to both the abundances of the species tested, and the intensity and scale of interactions, but negatively related to imbalance in abundances. Differences in detection power in combination with the abundance distributions found in natural communities are sufficient to explain all the three key empirical results, even if all pairwise interactions are identical. Critically, many hundreds of individuals of both species may be required to detect even intense interactions, implying current abundance thresholds for including species in the analyses are too low. Sy n thesis. The widespread failure to reject the null model of spatial interspecific independence could be due to low power of the tests rather than any key biological process. Since we do not model habitat associations, our results represent a first step in quantifying sample sizes required to make strong statements about the role of biotic interactions in diverse plant communities. However, power should be factored into analyses and considered when designing empirical studies.",The work has been supported by UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EP/N007336/1) and European Research Council (CoG 2015‐682172NETS).

In the last two decades, it has become clear that to further understand multitrophic interactions, the barrier between the belowground and aboveground domains has to be crossed. Belowground organisms that are intimately associated with the roots of terrestrial plants can influence the levels of primary and secondary chemistry and biomass of aboveground plant parts. These changes, in turn, influence the growth, development, and survival of aboveground insect herbivores. The discovery that soil organisms, which are usually out of sight and out of mind, can affect plant-herbivore interactions aboveground raised the question if and how higher trophic level organisms, such as carnivores, could be influenced. At present, the study of above-belowground interactions is evolving from interactions between organisms directly associated with the plant roots and shoots (e.g., root feeders - plant - foliar herbivores) to interactions involving members of higher trophic levels (e.g., parasitoids), as well as non-herbivorous organisms (e.g., decomposers, symbiotic plant mutualists, and pollinators). This multitrophic approach linking above- and belowground food webs aims at addressing interactions between plants, herbivores, and carnivores in a more realistic community setting. The ultimate goal is to understand the ecology and evolution of species in communities and, ultimately how community interactions contribute to the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we summarize studies on the effects of root feeders on aboveground insect herbivores and parasitoids and discuss if there are common trends. We discuss the mechanisms that have been reported to mediate these effects, from changes in concentrations of plant nutritional quality and secondary chemistry to defense signaling. Finally, we discuss how the traditional framework of fixed paired combinations of root- and shoot-related organisms feeding on a common plant can be transformed into a more dynamic and realistic framework that incorporates community variation in species, densities, space and time, in order to gain further insight in this exciting and rapidly developing field.","Open AccessThis article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License which permits any use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and the source are credited.",,Journal of Chemical Ecology,,Springer Nature,"0098-0331, 1573-1561","Animals; Ecosystem; Herbivory; Host-Parasite Interactions; Insecta; Plant Components, Aerial; Plant Physiological Phenomena; Plant Roots; Plants",2012-03-31,2012,2012-03-31,2012-06,38,6,755-767,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Soler, Roxina; Van der Putten, Wim H.; Harvey, Jeffrey A.; Vet, Louise E.

Methane cycling microbial communities play an important role in the global methane cycle, which is why the characterization of these communities is critical to understand and manipulate their behavior. Methanotrophs are a major player in these communities and are able to oxidize methane as their primary carbon source.
RESULTS: Lake Washington is a freshwater lake characterized by a methane-oxygen countergradient that contains a methane cycling microbial community. Methanotrophs are a major part of this community involved in assimilating methane from lake water. Two significant methanotrophic species in this community are Methylobacter and Methylomonas. In this work, these methanotrophs are computationally studied via developing highly curated genome-scale metabolic models. Each model was then integrated to form a community model with a multi-level optimization framework. The competitive and mutualistic metabolic interactions among Methylobacter and Methylomonas were also characterized. The community model was next tested under carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen limited conditions in addition to a nutrient-rich condition to observe the systematic shifts in the internal metabolic pathways and extracellular metabolite exchanges. Each condition showed variations in the methane oxidation pathway, pyruvate metabolism, and the TCA cycle as well as the excretion of formaldehyde and carbon di-oxide in the community. Finally, the community model was simulated under fixed ratios of these two members to reflect the opposing behavior in the two-member synthetic community and in sediment-incubated communities. The community simulations predicted a noticeable switch in intracellular carbon metabolism and formaldehyde transfer between community members in sediment-incubated vs. synthetic condition.
CONCLUSION: In this work, we attempted to predict the response of a simplified methane cycling microbial community from Lake Washington to varying environments and also provide an insight into the difference of dynamics in sediment-incubated microcosm community and synthetic co-cultures. Overall, this study lays the ground for in silico systems-level studies of freshwater lake ecosystems, which can drive future efforts of understanding, engineering, and modifying these communities for dealing with global warming issues.","This work was supported by University of Nebraska-Lincoln Faculty Startup Grant (21-1106-4308) to Rajib Saha and University of Nebraska-Lincoln UCARE Program.

Microbial community in paddy soils is of great interest since many microorganisms are involved in soil functional processes. In the present study, Illumina Mi-Seq sequencing and functional gene array (GeoChip 4.2) techniques were combined to investigate soil microbial communities and functional gene patterns across the three soil types including an Inceptisol (Binhai), an Oxisol (Leizhou), and an Ultisol (Taoyuan) along four profile depths (up to 70 cm in depth) in mesocosm incubation columns. Detrended correspondence analysis revealed that distinctly differentiation in microbial community existed among soil types and profile depths, while the manifest variance in functional structure was only observed among soil types and two rice growth stages, but not across profile depths. Along the profile depth within each soil type, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Firmicutes increased whereas Cyanobacteria, β-proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia declined, suggesting their specific ecophysiological properties. Compared to bacterial community, the archaeal community showed a more contrasting pattern with the predominant groups within phyla Euryarchaeota, Thaumarchaeota, and Crenarchaeota largely varying among soil types and depths. Phylogenetic molecular ecological network (pMEN) analysis further indicated that the pattern of bacterial and archaeal communities interactions changed with soil depth and the highest modularity of microbial community occurred in top soils, implying a relatively higher system resistance to environmental change compared to communities in deeper soil layers. Meanwhile, microbial communities had higher connectivity in deeper soils in comparison with upper soils, suggesting less microbial interaction in surface soils. Structure equation models were developed and the models indicated that pH was the most representative characteristics of soil type and identified as the key driver in shaping both bacterial and archaeal community structure, but did not directly affect microbial functional structure. The distinctive pattern of microbial taxonomic and functional composition along soil profiles implied functional redundancy within these paddy soils.","This work was financially supported by the National Science Foundation of China (No. 41322007), Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB15020200), MOST (2014BAD14B00), and Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences.

However, broad ecological differences between bacterial and fungal organisms, such as growth rates, stress tolerance, and substrate utilization, suggest they could follow distinct trajectories and show contrasting dynamics during recovery. In this study, we analyzed both the intra-annual variability and decade-scale recovery of bacterial and fungal communities in a chronosequence of reclaimed mined soils using next-generation sequencing to quantify their abundance, richness, β-diversity, taxonomic composition, and cooccurrence network properties. Bacterial communities shifted gradually, with overlapping β-diversity patterns across chronosequence ages, while shifts in fungal communities were more distinct among different ages. In addition, the magnitude of intra-annual variability in bacterial β-diversity was comparable to the changes across decades of chronosequence age, while fungal communities changed minimally across months. Finally, the complexity of bacterial cooccurrence networks increased with chronosequence age, while fungal networks did not show clear age-related trends. We hypothesize that these contrasting dynamics of bacteria and fungi in the chronosequence result from (i) higher growth rates for bacteria, leading to higher intra-annual variability; (ii) higher tolerance to environmental changes for fungi; and (iii) stronger influence of vegetation on fungal communities.IMPORTANCE Both bacteria and fungi play essential roles in ecosystem functions, and information about their recovery after extreme disturbances is important for understanding whole-ecosystem development. Given their many differences in phenotype, phylogeny, and life history, a comparison of different bacterial and fungal recovery patterns improves the understanding of how different components of the soil microbiota respond to ecosystem recovery. In this study, we highlight key differences between soil bacteria and fungi during the restoration of reclaimed mine soils in the form of long-term diversity patterns, intra-annual variability, and potential interaction networks. Cooccurrence networks revealed increasingly complex bacterial community interactions during recovery, in contrast to much simpler and more isolated fungal network patterns. This study compares bacterial and fungal cooccurrence networks and reveals cooccurrences persisting through successional ages.","Funding for this work was provided by the Powell River Project, Virginia Tech, and by the Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station and the Capacity Funds by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture.

We monitored the transcriptome of Prochlorococcus, grown either alone or in coculture, across a diel light:dark cycle and under the stress of extended darkness-a condition that cells would experience when mixed below the ocean's euphotic zone. More Prochlorococcus transcripts exhibited 24-h periodic oscillations in coculture than in pure culture, both over the normal diel cycle and after the shift to extended darkness. This demonstrates that biotic interactions, and not just light, can affect timing mechanisms in Prochlorococcus, which lacks a self-sustaining circadian oscillator. The transcriptomes of replicate pure cultures of Prochlorococcus lost their synchrony within 5 h of extended darkness and reflected changes in stress responses and metabolic functions consistent with growth cessation. In contrast, when grown with Alteromonas, replicate Prochlorococcus transcriptomes tracked each other for at least 13 h in the dark and showed signs of continued biosynthetic and metabolic activity. The transcriptome patterns suggest that the heterotroph may be providing energy or essential biosynthetic substrates to Prochlorococcus in the form of organic compounds, sustaining this autotroph when it is deprived of solar energy. Our findings reveal conditions where mixotrophic metabolism may benefit marine cyanobacteria and highlight new impacts of community interactions on basic Prochlorococcus cellular processes. IMPORTANCEProchlorococcus is the most abundant photosynthetic organism on the planet. These cells play a central role in the physiology of surrounding heterotrophs by supplying them with fixed organic carbon. It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that interactions with heterotrophs can affect autotrophs as well. Here we show that such interactions have a marked impact on the response of Prochlorococcus to the stress of extended periods of darkness, as reflected in transcriptional dynamics. These data suggest that diel transcriptional rhythms within Prochlorococcus, which are generally considered to be strictly under the control of light quantity, quality, and timing, can also be influenced by biotic interactions. Together, these findings provide new insights into the importance of microbial interactions on Prochlorococcus physiology and reveal conditions where heterotroph-derived compounds may support autotrophs-contrary to the canonical autotroph-to-heterotroph trophic paradigm.","This work was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation (OCE-1356460 and DBI-0424599, the NSF Center for Microbial Oceanography Research and Education), the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation (grant GBMF495), and the Simons Foundation (SCOPE award ID 329108, S.W.C.; LIFE ID 337262, S.W.C.).

1129,pub.1052786844,10.1128/mbio.00538-16,27222468,PMC4895107,,Staphylococcus aureus Protein A Mediates Interspecies Interactions at the Cell Surface of Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"While considerable research has focused on the properties of individual bacteria, relatively little is known about how microbial interspecies interactions alter bacterial behaviors and pathogenesis. Staphylococcus aureus frequently coinfects with other pathogens in a range of different infectious diseases. For example, coinfection by S. aureus with Pseudomonas aeruginosa occurs commonly in people with cystic fibrosis and is associated with higher lung disease morbidity and mortality. S. aureus secretes numerous exoproducts that are known to interact with host tissues, influencing inflammatory responses. The abundantly secreted S. aureus staphylococcal protein A (SpA) binds a range of human glycoproteins, immunoglobulins, and other molecules, with diverse effects on the host, including inhibition of phagocytosis of S. aureus cells. However, the potential effects of SpA and other S. aureus exoproducts on coinfecting bacteria have not been explored. Here, we show that S. aureus-secreted products, including SpA, significantly alter two behaviors associated with persistent infection. We found that SpA inhibited biofilm formation by specific P. aeruginosa clinical isolates, and it also inhibited phagocytosis by neutrophils of all isolates tested. Our results indicate that these effects were mediated by binding to at least two P. aeruginosa cell surface structures-type IV pili and the exopolysaccharide Psl-that confer attachment to surfaces and to other bacterial cells. Thus, we found that the role of a well-studied S. aureus exoproduct, SpA, extends well beyond interactions with the host immune system. Secreted SpA alters multiple persistence-associated behaviors of another common microbial community member, likely influencing cocolonization and coinfection with other microbes.
IMPORTANCE: Bacteria rarely exist in isolation, whether on human tissues or in the environment, and they frequently coinfect with other microbes. However, relatively little is known about how microbial interspecies interactions alter bacterial behaviors and pathogenesis. We identified a novel interaction between two bacterial species that frequently infect together-Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa We show that the S. aureus-secreted protein staphylococcal protein A (SpA), which is well-known for interacting with host targets, also binds to specific P. aeruginosa cell surface molecules and alters two persistence-associated P. aeruginosa behaviors: biofilm formation and uptake by host immune cells. Because S. aureus frequently precedes P. aeruginosa in chronic infections, these findings reveal how microbial community interactions can impact persistence and host interactions during coinfections.","We thank J.

What has not been considered is the natural extension of these interactions to live attenuated immunizations, and in particular, live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs). Using a mouse-adapted LAIV against influenza A (H3N2) virus carrying the same mutations as the human FluMist vaccine, we find that LAIV vaccination reverses normal bacterial clearance from the nasopharynx and significantly increases bacterial carriage densities of the clinically important bacterial pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae (serotypes 19F and 7F) and Staphylococcus aureus (strains Newman and Wright) within the upper respiratory tract of mice. Vaccination with LAIV also resulted in 2- to 5-fold increases in mean durations of bacterial carriage. Furthermore, we show that the increases in carriage density and duration were nearly identical in all aspects to changes in bacterial colonizing dynamics following infection with wild-type (WT) influenza virus. Importantly, LAIV, unlike WT influenza viruses, had no effect on severe bacterial disease or mortality within the lower respiratory tract. Our findings are, to the best of our knowledge, the first to demonstrate that vaccination with a live attenuated viral vaccine can directly modulate colonizing dynamics of important and unrelated human bacterial pathogens, and does so in a manner highly analogous to that seen following wild-type virus infection.
IMPORTANCE: Following infection with an influenza virus, infected or recently recovered individuals become transiently susceptible to excess bacterial infections, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. Indeed, in the absence of preexisting comorbidities, bacterial infections are a leading cause of severe disease during influenza epidemics. While this synergy has been known and is well studied, what has not been explored is the natural extension of these interactions to live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs). Here we show, in mice, that vaccination with LAIV primes the upper respiratory tract for increased bacterial growth and persistence of bacterial carriage, in a manner nearly identical to that seen following wild-type influenza virus infections. Importantly, LAIV, unlike wild-type virus, did not increase severe bacterial disease of the lower respiratory tract. These findings may have consequences for individual bacterial disease processes within the upper respiratory tract, as well as bacterial transmission dynamics within LAIV-vaccinated populations.","This work was funded by ALSAC-St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital to J.A.M. and a Burroughs Wellcome Fund “Molecules to Mankind” grant to M.J.M.

Developing model communities amenable to genetic dissection will underpin successful strategies for shaping microbiomes by advancing an understanding of community interactions. We developed a model community with representatives from three dominant rhizosphere taxa, the Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes We chose Bacillus cereus as a model rhizosphere firmicute and characterized 20 other candidates, including ""hitchhikers"" that coisolated with B. cereus from the rhizosphere. Pairwise analysis produced a hierarchical interstrain-competition network. We chose two hitchhikers, Pseudomonas koreensis from the top tier of the competition network and Flavobacterium johnsoniae from the bottom of the network, to represent the Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, respectively. The model community has several emergent properties, induction of dendritic expansion of B. cereus colonies by either of the other members, and production of more robust biofilms by the three members together than individually. Moreover, P. koreensis produces a novel family of alkaloid antibiotics that inhibit growth of F. johnsoniae, and production is inhibited by B. cereus We designate this community THOR, because the members are the hitchhikers of the rhizosphere. The genetic, genomic, and biochemical tools available for dissection of THOR provide the means to achieve a new level of understanding of microbial community behavior.IMPORTANCE The manipulation and engineering of microbiomes could lead to improved human health, environmental sustainability, and agricultural productivity. However, microbiomes have proven difficult to alter in predictable ways, and their emergent properties are poorly understood. The history of biology has demonstrated the power of model systems to understand complex problems such as gene expression or development. Therefore, a defined and genetically tractable model community would be useful to dissect microbiome assembly, maintenance, and processes. We have developed a tractable model rhizosphere microbiome, designated THOR, containing Pseudomonas koreensis, Flavobacterium johnsoniae, and Bacillus cereus, which represent three dominant phyla in the rhizosphere, as well as in soil and the mammalian gut. The model community demonstrates emergent properties, and the members are amenable to genetic dissection. We propose that THOR will be a useful model for investigations of community-level interactions.","We gratefully acknowledge Jennifer Heinritz for her assistance with microscopy.

However, a comprehensive understanding of how abiotic and biotic factors shape bacterial community assembly in PNA reactors is not well reported.ResultsHere, we used integrated multi-omics (i.e., high-throughput 16S rRNA gene, metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metaproteomic sequencing) to reveal how abiotic and biotic factors shape the bacterial community assembly in a lab-scale one-stage PNA reactor treating synthetic wastewater. Analysis results of amplicon sequences (16S rRNA gene) from a time-series revealed distinct relative abundance patterns of the key autotrophic bacteria, i.e., anammox bacteria and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), and the associated heterotrophic populations in the seed sludge and the sludge at the new stable state after deterioration. Using shotgun metagenomic sequences of anammox sludge, we recovered 58 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), including 3 MAGs of anammox bacteria and 3 MAGs of AOB. The integrated metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metaproteomic data revealed that nitrogen metabolism is the most active process in the studied PNA reactor. The abundant heterotrophs contribute to the reduction of nitrate to nitrite/ammonium for autotrophic bacteria (anammox bacteria and AOB). Genomic and transcriptomic data revealed that the preference for electron donors of the dominant heterotrophs in different bacterial assemblages (seed and new stable state) varied along with the shift in anammox bacteria that have different metabolic features in terms of EPS composition. Notably, the most abundant heterotrophic bacteria in the reactor were more auxotrophic than the less abundant heterotrophs, regarding the syntheses of amino acids and vitamins. In addition, one of the abundant bacteria observed in the bacterial community exhibited highly transcribed secretion systems (type VI).ConclusionsThese findings provide the first insight that the bacterial communities in the PNA reactor are defined by not only abiotic factors (operating mode) but also metabolic interactions, such as nitrogen metabolism, exchange of electron donors, and auxotrophies.","YW, LL, and YC wish to thank the University of Hong Kong for the postgraduate scholarships.

Within the framework of constraint-based modelling, the generation of quantitative relationships is facilitated by the realization that cell phenotypes are limited by physical and genetic constraints.Physical laws, such as mass conservation and thermodynamics, constrain the possible metabolic and biosynthetic transformations that can occur in nature, and genetics specify which sets of biochemical reactions have been selected through evolution. Genome sequencing and annotation have allowed the comprehensive reconstruction of microbial metabolic networks, and constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA) modelling has emerged as a set of valuable tools that allows detailed analysis of the biochemical mechanisms underlying the metabolic genotype–phenotype relationship.Network-based pathway analysis tools, such as elementary flux modes and extreme pathways analysis, delineate pathways that can perform a given metabolic function in an organism of interest. Although these methods have been difficult to use in larger metabolic networks, simplifications are now beginning to allow their use on genome-scale models.As not all pathways are used in a cell at a given time, optimization algorithms are routinely used to identify pathway use that best reflects the in vivo metabolic state. Flux balance analysis, which uses linear programing to optimize a mathematical description of the cellular objective, has been widely used to understand microbial physiology and the effects of environmental and genetic perturbations.The ability of COBRA methods to model genetic perturbations has allowed such methods to help predict antimicrobial targets and to aid in the design of strains for chemical production.Reconstructed metabolic networks are often incomplete and can have a small fraction of incorrect reactions therein. However, the integration of phenotypic screens with model simulations can provide a systematic approach to refine the models and discover new metabolic functions in an organism.COBRA methods are extending beyond metabolism, and approaches are beginning to incorporate transcription regulation, either implicitly, by constraining models with multiple 'omic data types, or explicitly, with detailed descriptions of regulatory mechanisms.The diverse range of more than 100 COBRA methods is being deployed to address many questions in microbiology. For example, several recent studies have begun to explore the roles of metabolism in community interactions, including symbiosis, competition, parasitism and evolution.","The authors thank M.

Recent work has shown that the VOC trimethylamine (TMA) can promote a new form of Streptomyces growth, termed ""exploration."" Here, we report that TMA also serves to alter nutrient availability in the area surrounding exploring cultures: TMA dramatically increases the environmental pH and, in doing so, reduces iron availability. This, in turn, compromises the growth of other soil bacteria and fungi. In response to this low-iron environment, Streptomyces venezuelae secretes a suite of differentially modified siderophores and upregulates genes associated with siderophore uptake. Further reducing iron levels by limiting siderophore uptake or growing cultures in the presence of iron chelators enhanced exploration. Exploration was also increased when S. venezuelae was grown in association with the related low-iron- and TMA-tolerant Amycolatopsis bacteria, due to competition for available iron. We are only beginning to appreciate the role of VOCs in natural communities. This work reveals a new role for VOCs in modulating iron levels in the environment and implies a critical role for VOCs in modulating the behavior of microbes and the makeup of their communities. It further adds a new dimension to our understanding of the interspecies interactions that influence Streptomyces exploration and highlights the importance of iron in exploration modulation.IMPORTANCE Microbial growth and community interactions are influenced by a multitude of factors. A new mode of Streptomyces growth-exploration-is promoted by interactions with the yeast Saccharomycescerevisiae and requires the emission of trimethylamine (TMA), a pH-raising volatile compound. We show here that TMA emission also profoundly alters the environment around exploring cultures. It specifically reduces iron availability, and this in turn adversely affects the viability of surrounding microbes. Paradoxically, Streptomyces bacteria thrive in these iron-depleted niches, both rewiring their gene expression and metabolism to facilitate iron uptake and increasing their exploration rate. Growth in close proximity to other microbes adept at iron uptake also enhances exploration. Collectively, the data from this work reveal a new role for bacterial volatile compounds in modulating nutrient availability and microbial community behavior. The results further expand the repertoire of interspecies interactions and nutrient cues that impact Streptomyces exploration and provide new mechanistic insight into this unique mode of bacterial growth.","We thank Gerard Wright and Matt Traxler for the Amycolatopsis orientalis and sp.

Islands can be considered 'nature's test tubes'- simple systems with multiple replicates. Our research has used the simplicity of island systems to understand ecological community dynamics and to compare the properties of island communities with those in more complex mainland systems. Here, we present three topics: (i) current patterns of biodiversity on isolated islands of the Pacific; (ii) current patterns of disturbance and invasion on islands; and (iii) future trajectories inferred from these patterns. We examine features of islands (in particular, topography and isolation) that have allowed for given levels and distribution of endemicity. The extent to which island communities are impacted by, resist or accommodate disturbance and/or invasions by nonindigenous species appears to be dictated to a large extent by properties of the native communities and how these communities were originally assembled. Accordingly, patterns of disturbance and invasion are very different for high (montane) islands that are extremely isolated compared to those that are nearer to a source of natural migrants. As with all biotas, those on islands are dynamic entities. However, the unique aspect of islands is their isolation, and extreme isolation has largely been lost over the course of the last few centuries due to the development of transportation routes. We argue that such a modified dynamic will affect the future of the biota and the processes that gave rise to the biota. Specifically for isolated habitats, ecological processes will become increasingly more likely to generate biodiversity than evolutionary processes which have been relatively more important in the past. In the short term, island biotas and other similar biotas that occur in montane habitats may fare well as species are often abundant locally in the habitat to which they are indigenous, and may demonstrate considerable resistance and resilience to invasion. However, island biotas - and other biotas that show high local endemism - will likely not fare well in the face of prolonged disturbance. The biotas in these areas generally display a relatively low dispersal capacity; therefore, under conditions of long-term habitat modification, isolated biotas are likely to be swamped by non-natives, which - simply because of random processes and higher propagule pressure - will move more readily into available habitats. Thus, despite the importance of incorporating the evolutionary process into conservation efforts, we must also be careful to evaluate the likely form that the processes will take when the context (specifically, extent of isolation) has been highly modified.","We thank Tom Smith and Louis Bernatchez for organizing the very exciting International Summit on Evolutionary Change in Human‐altered Environments, and two anonymous reviewers and attendees for stimulating talks and suggestions.

Here, we analyzed the effects of environmental factors and parasitic burdens on the microbial composition and diversity within the GIT of the brown trout (Salmo trutta). We focused on the emerging dangerous salmonid myxozoan parasite Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae, which causes proliferative kidney disease in salmonid fish, to demonstrate the potential role of GIT micobiomes in the modulation of host-parasite relationships. The microbial diversity in the GIT displayed clear clustering according to the river of origin, while considerable variation was also found among fish from the same river. Environmental variables such as oxygen concentration, water temperature, and river morphometry strongly associated with both the river microbial community and the GIT microbiome, supporting the role of the environment in microbial assemblage and the relative insignificance of the host genotype and gender. Contrary to expectations, the parasite load exhibited a significant positive relationship with the richness of the GIT microbiome. Many operational taxonomic units (OTUs; n = 202) are more abundant in T. bryosalmonae-infected fish, suggesting that brown trout with large parasite burdens are prone to lose their GIT microbiome homeostasis. The OTUs with the strongest increase in infected trout are mostly nonpathogenic aquatic, anaerobic sediment/sludge, or ruminant bacteria. Our results underscore the significance of the interactions among parasitic disease, abiotic factors, and the GIT microbiome in disease etiology. IMPORTANCE Cohabiting microorganisms play diverse and important roles in the biology of multicellular hosts, but their diversity and interactions with abiotic and biotic factors remain largely unsurveyed. Nevertheless, it is becoming increasingly clear that many properties of host phenotypes reflect contributions from the associated microbiome. We focus on a question of how parasites, the host genetic background, and abiotic factors influence the microbiome in salmonid hosts by using a host-parasite model consisting of wild brown trout (Salmo trutta) and the myxozoan Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae, which causes widely distributed proliferative kidney disease. We show that parasite infection increases the frequency of bacteria from the surrounding river water community, reflecting impaired homeostasis in the fish gut. Our results also demonstrate the importance of abiotic environmental factors and host size in the assemblage of the gut microbiome of fish and the relative insignificance of the host genotype and gender.","We thank Lilian Pukk and Tauno Jürgenstein for assistance during field work and Christian Ritz for advice on statistical methods.

Cyanobacteria in phototrophic biofilms can reuse extracellular organic carbon, but the metabolic drivers of extracellular processes are surprisingly complex. We investigated the metabolic foundations of organic matter reuse by comparing exoproteome composition and incorporation of (13)C-labeled and (15)N-labeled cyanobacterial extracellular organic matter (EOM) in a unicyanobacterial biofilm incubated using different light regimes. In the light and the dark, cyanobacterial direct organic C assimilation accounted for 32% and 43%, respectively, of all organic C assimilation in the community. Under photosynthesis conditions, we measured increased excretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and proteins involved in micronutrient transport, suggesting that requirements for micronutrients may drive EOM assimilation during daylight hours. This interpretation was supported by photosynthesis inhibition experiments, in which cyanobacteria incorporated N-rich EOM-derived material. In contrast, under dark, C-starved conditions, cyanobacteria incorporated C-rich EOM-derived organic matter, decreased excretion of EPS, and showed an increased abundance of degradative exoproteins, demonstrating the use of the extracellular domain for C storage. Sequence-structure modeling of one of these exoproteins predicted a specific hydrolytic activity that was subsequently detected, confirming increased EOM degradation in the dark. Associated heterotrophic bacteria increased in abundance and upregulated transport proteins under dark relative to light conditions. Taken together, our results indicate that biofilm cyanobacteria are successful competitors for organic C and N and that cyanobacterial nutrient and energy requirements control the use of EOM.
IMPORTANCE: Cyanobacteria are globally distributed primary producers, and the fate of their fixed C influences microbial biogeochemical cycling. This fate is complicated by cyanobacterial degradation and assimilation of organic matter, but because cyanobacteria are assumed to be poor competitors for organic matter consumption, regulation of this process is not well tested. In mats and biofilms, this is especially relevant because cyanobacteria produce an extensive organic extracellular matrix, providing the community with a rich source of nutrients. Light is a well-known regulator of cyanobacterial metabolism, so we characterized the effects of light availability on the incorporation of organic matter. Using stable isotope tracing at the single-cell level, we quantified photoautotroph assimilation under different metabolic conditions and integrated the results with proteomics to elucidate metabolic status. We found that cyanobacteria effectively compete for organic matter in the light and the dark and that nutrient requirements and community interactions contribute to cycling of extracellular organic matter.","Funding was provided by the DOE Genomic Science Program under contract SCW1039.

These conditions likely impose nongrowth states for microbes. However, nongrowth states are uncharacterized for the majority of environmental bacteria, especially in regard to exometabolite production. We compared exometabolites produced over stationary phase across three environmental bacteria: Burkholderia thailandensis E264 (ATCC 700388), Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC 31532, and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (ATCC BAA-871). We grew each strain in monoculture and investigated exometabolite dynamics from mid-exponential to stationary phases. We focused on exometabolites that were released into the medium and accumulated over 45 h, including approximately 20 h of stationary phase. We also analyzed transcripts (transcriptome sequencing [RNA-seq]) to interpret exometabolite output. We found that the majority of exometabolites released were strain specific, with a subset of identified exometabolites involved in both central and secondary metabolism. Transcript analysis supported that exometabolites were released from intact cells, as various transporters had either increased or consistent transcripts through time. Interestingly, we found that succinate was one of the most abundant identifiable exometabolites for all strains and that each strain rerouted their metabolic pathways involved in succinate production during stationary phase. These results show that nongrowth states can be metabolically dynamic and that environmental bacteria can enrich a minimal environment with diverse chemical compounds as a consequence of growth and postgrowth maintenance in stationary phase. This work provides insights into microbial community interactions via exometabolites under conditions of growth cessation or limitation.IMPORTANCE Nongrowth states are common for bacteria that live in environments that are densely populated and predominantly nutrient exhausted, and yet these states remain largely uncharacterized in cellular metabolism and metabolite output. Here, we investigated and compared stationary-phase exometabolites and RNA transcripts for each of three environmental bacterial strains. We observed that diverse exometabolites were produced and provide evidence that these exometabolites accumulate over time through release by intact cells. Additionally, each bacterial strain had a characteristic exometabolite profile and exhibited dynamics in exometabolite composition. This work affirms that stationary phase is metabolically dynamic, with each strain tested creating a unique chemical signature in the extracellular space and altering metabolism in stationary phase. These findings set the stage for understanding how bacterial populations can support surrounding neighbors in environments with prolonged nutrient exhaustion through exometabolite-mediated interspecies interactions.","Michigan State University also provided start-up funds to Shade to initiate this project.

1060,pub.1076877110,10.2166/wst.2004.0873,15303758,,,Microbial communities and their interactions in biofilm systems: an overview,"Several important advances have been made in the study of biofilm microbial populations relating to their spatial structure (or architecture), their community structure, and their dependence on physicochemical parameters. With the knowledge that hydrodynamic forces influence biofilm architecture came the realization that metabolic processes may be enhanced if certain spatial structures can be forced. An example is the extent of plasmid-mediated horizontal gene transfer in biofilms. Recent in situ work in defined model systems has shown that the biofilm architecture plays a role for genetic transfer by bacterial conjugation in determining how far the donor cells can penetrate the biofilm. Open channels and pores allow for more efficient donor transport and hence more frequent cell collisions leading to rapid spread of the genes by horizontal gene transfer. Such insight into the physical environment of biofilms can be utilized for bioenhancement of catabolic processes by introduction of mobile genetic elements into an existing microbial community. If the donor organisms themselves persist, bioaugmentation can lead to successful establishment of newly introduced species and may be a more successful strategy than biostimulation (the addition of nutrients or specific carbon sources to stimulate the authochthonous population) as shown for an enrichment culture of nitrifying bacteria added to rotating disk biofilm reactors using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and microelectrode measurements of NH4+, NO2-, NO3-, and O2. However, few studies have been carried out on full-scale systems. Bioaugmentation and bioenhancement are most successful if a constant selective pressure can be maintained favoring the promulgation of the added enrichment culture. Overall, knowledge gain about microbial community interactions in biofilms continues to be driven by the availability of methods for the rapid analysis of microbial communities and their activities. Molecular tools can be grouped into those suitable for ex situ and in situ community analysis. Non-spatial community analysis, in the sense of assessing changes in microbial populations as a function of time or environmental conditions, relies on general fingerprinting methods, like DGGE and T-RFLP, performed on nucleic acids extracted from biofilm. These approaches have been most useful when combined with gene amplification, cloning and sequencing to assemble a phylogenetic inventory of microbial species. It is expected that the use of oligonucleotide microarrays will greatly facilitate the analysis of microbial communities and their activities in biofilms. Structure-activity relationships can be explored using incorporation of 13C-labeled substrates into microbial DNA and RNA to identify metabolically active community members. Finally, based on the DNA sequences in a biofilm, FISH probes can be designed to verify the abundance and spatial location of microbial community members. This in turn allows for in situ structure/function analysis when FISH is combined with microsensors, microautoradiography, and confocal laser scanning microscopy with advanced image analysis.",,,Water Science & Technology,,IWA Publishing,"0273-1223, 1996-9732","Bacteria; Biofilms; DNA, Bacterial; Genetics, Population; In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Population Dynamics; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water Movements",2004-06-01,2004,,2004-06-01,49,11-12,327-336,Closed,Article,"Wuertz, S.; Okabe, S.; Hausner, M.","Wuertz, S.

1002,pub.1038563977,10.1093/aob/mcv054,26019168,PMC4648464,,Mechanisms and ecological consequences of plant defence induction and suppression in herbivore communities,"BACKGROUND: Plants are hotbeds for parasites such as arthropod herbivores, which acquire nutrients and energy from their hosts in order to grow and reproduce. Hence plants are selected to evolve resistance, which in turn selects for herbivores that can cope with this resistance. To preserve their fitness when attacked by herbivores, plants can employ complex strategies that include reallocation of resources and the production of defensive metabolites and structures. Plant defences can be either prefabricated or be produced only upon attack. Those that are ready-made are referred to as constitutive defences. Some constitutive defences are operational at any time while others require activation. Defences produced only when herbivores are present are referred to as induced defences. These can be established via de novo biosynthesis of defensive substances or via modifications of prefabricated substances and consequently these are active only when needed. Inducibility of defence may serve to save energy and to prevent self-intoxication but also implies that there is a delay in these defences becoming operational. Induced defences can be characterized by alterations in plant morphology and molecular chemistry and are associated with a decrease in herbivore performance. These alterations are set in motion by signals generated by herbivores. Finally, a subset of induced metabolites are released into the air as volatiles and function as a beacon for foraging natural enemies searching for prey, and this is referred to as induced indirect defence.
SCOPE: The objective of this review is to evaluate (1) which strategies plants have evolved to cope with herbivores and (2) which traits herbivores have evolved that enable them to counter these defences. The primary focus is on the induction and suppression of plant defences and the review outlines how the palette of traits that determine induction/suppression of, and resistance/susceptibility of herbivores to, plant defences can give rise to exploitative competition and facilitation within ecological communities ""inhabiting"" a plant.
CONCLUSIONS: Herbivores have evolved diverse strategies, which are not mutually exclusive, to decrease the negative effects of plant defences in order to maximize the conversion of plant material into offspring. Numerous adaptations have been found in herbivores, enabling them to dismantle or bypass defensive barriers, to avoid tissues with relatively high levels of defensive chemicals or to metabolize these chemicals once ingested. In addition, some herbivores interfere with the onset or completion of induced plant defences, resulting in the plant's resistance being partly or fully suppressed. The ability to suppress induced plant defences appears to occur across plant parasites from different kingdoms, including herbivorous arthropods, and there is remarkable diversity in suppression mechanisms. Suppression may strongly affect the structure of the food web, because the ability to suppress the activation of defences of a communal host may facilitate competitors, whereas the ability of a herbivore to cope with activated plant defences will not. Further characterization of the mechanisms and traits that give rise to suppression of plant defences will enable us to determine their role in shaping direct and indirect interactions in food webs and the extent to which these determine the coexistence and persistence of species.","This paper is dedicated to the loving memory of our dear friend and mentor Maurice Sabelis who passed away a week before the manuscript was submitted.

622,pub.1046968340,10.1139/f06-013,,,,"Predation, competition, and the recovery of overexploited fish stocks in marine reserves","Community interactions alter the management actions necessary to recover overfished species using marine reserves. For example, in communities where a larger species preys on their juveniles' competitors, overfishing of the larger species may cause prey population expansion; subsequent increased competition for the juveniles of the over fished species may impede its recovery within reserves. We explore the implications of such community interactions for reserve design with a model of a subtidal rockfish (genus Sebastes) system from the Northeast Pacific Ocean within a no-take reserve. Ignoring community interactions, the model predicts that a reserve large enough for internal recruitment to counterbalance mortality will allow recovery of the overfished species. However, after incorporating community interactions, the model predicts that two alternative stable states exist: one where the overfished species dominates and one where the prey dominates. In the community model, the ability of an overfished system to recover to the equilibrium where the overfished species dominates after reserve establishment depends on the initial densities of both species, and a larger reserve is required for recovery to be possible.",,,Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences,,Canadian Science Publishing,"0706-652X, 1205-7533",,2006-06-01,2006,,2006-06-01,63,6,1214-1229,All OA; Green,Article,"Baskett, Marissa L; Yoklavich, Mary; Love, Milton S","Baskett, Marissa L (); Yoklavich, Mary (); Love, Milton S ()",,"Baskett, Marissa L (); Yoklavich, Mary (); Love, Milton S ()",,,,,,,,,,,34,2,,2.58,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt5815r8zc/qt5815r8zc.pdf?t=px9p2i,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1046968340,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,14 Life Below Water

However, release from soil enemies does not explain all plant invasions. The invasion of Ammophila arenaria (marram grass or European beach grass) in California provides an illustrative example for which the enemy release hypothesis has been refuted. To explore the possible role of plant–soil community interactions in this invasion, we developed a mathematical model. First, we analyzed the role of plant–soil community interactions in the succession of A. arenaria in its native range (north‐western Europe). Then, we used our model to explore for California how alternative plant–soil community interactions may generate the same effect as if A. arenaria were released from soil enemies. This analysis was carried out by construction of a ‘recovery plane’ that discriminates between plant competition and plant–soil community interactions. Our model shows that in California, the accumulation of local pathogens by A. arenaria could result in exclusion of native plant species. Moreover, this mechanism could trigger the rate and spatial pattern of invasive spread generally observed in nature. We propose that our ‘accumulation of local pathogens’ hypothesis could serve as an alternative explanation for the enemy release hypothesis to be considered in further experimental studies on invasive plant species.",,,Oikos,,Wiley,"0030-1299, 1600-0706",,2006-04-21,2006,2006-04-21,2006-07,114,1,168-176,All OA; Green,Article,"Eppinga, Maarten B.; Rietkerk, Max; Dekker, Stefan C.; De Ruiter, Peter C.; Van der Putten, Wim H.; Van der Putten, Wim H.","Eppinga, Maarten B.

Here we clarify that the use of conservative classification of rotifer taxonomy in our study did not affect the conclusions, particularly the one that the genus-level, rather than family-level, surrogates were relatively reliable and effective in assessing community-environment interactions. The major reasons include: 1) Jiang et al. (2019) applied improper log (x + 0.001) transformation in redundancy analysis (RDA) and consequently overestimated the effectiveness of family-level surrogates; 2) The statistical methods that we used in our study (Xiong et al., 2018a) were completely appropriate, as forward selection was not limited by the normality assumption or collinearity among environmental variables. Based on both ways (conservative and revised) of taxonomy classification, the forward selection analysis clearly showed that critical environmental variables responsible for environment-community interactions were wrongly excluded when using family-level surrogates.","We thank Dr. F.

However, although the composition, diversity and function of bacterial communities have been well studied, little is known about the interactions and co-occurrence characteristics of these communities, let alone their seasonal patterns. To investigate the seasonal variations of bacterial community interactions, we collected water samples from four seasons in Lake Taihu and applied network analysis to reveal bacterial community interactions. Bacterial community networks were non-random in structure, and interactions among bacterial taxa in the networks varied markedly in different seasons. The autumnal bacterial network was the largest and most complex among obtained networks, whereas the spring correlation network was the simplest, having no module hubs or connectors. The important species of the networks were the dominant bacterial phyla/classes (e.g., Alphaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes), although their relative abundance varied among seasons. The relationships between species and measured environmental variables changed over seasons; fewer environmental factors were correlated with bacterial species in the spring bacterial network, while we observed a greater number of species-environment correlations in the winter network.

Here we conduct time‐series analyses with multivariate autoregressive (MAR) models of marine zooplankton abundance in the Northern California Current from 1996 to 2009 to determine the influence of climate variables on zooplankton community interactions. Autoregressive models showed different community interactions during warm vs. cool ocean climate conditions. Negative ecological interactions among zooplankton groups characterized the major warm phase during the time series, whereas during the major cool phase, ocean transport largely structured zooplankton communities. Local environmental conditions (sea temperature) and large‐scale climate indices (El Niño/Southern Oscillation) were associated with changes in zooplankton abundance across the full time series. Secondary environmental correlates of zooplankton abundance varied with ocean climate phase, with most support during the warm phase for upwelling as a covariate, and most support during the cool phase for salinity. Through simultaneous quantitation of community interactions and environmental covariates, we show that marine zooplankton community structure varies with climate, suggesting that predictions about ecosystem responses to future climate scenarios in the Northern California Current should include potential changes to the base of the pelagic food.","We thank the many members of the Peterson lab who have collected and analyzed data from the Newport Line time series over the years, especially Leah Feinberg, Tracy Shaw, Jennifer Menkel and Jay Peterson.

Ecotoxicological studies are often focused on the abundance analysis of their communities. In this study, I discuss the possibility of incorporating correlation networks to earlier bring to light the possible hidden effects of environmental stressors on community interactions. A re‐analysis of the published data from an experiment where the herbicides glyphosate, 2,4‐D and their mixtures were applied in microcosms revealed that correlation networks can detect impacts on the community interactions at herbicide concentrations lower than those in which abundances were drastically modified. I propose the correlation of abundances network analysis (CANA) as a new approach for ecotoxicological freshwater community studies.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I thank Dr. Haydée Pizarro for stimulating me and for her support all these years.

In many animals, warming-related fitness depression appears more closely linked to changes in ecological community interactions than to direct thermal stress. This biotic community framework is commonly applied to warming studies at the scale of ecosystems but is rarely applied at the scale of microbiomes. Here, we used replicated bromeliad microecosystems to show warming effects on tadpole gut microbiome dysbiosis mediated through biotic community interactions. Warming shifted environmental bacteria and arthropod community composition, with linkages to changes in microbial recruitment that promoted dysbiosis and stunted tadpole growth. Tadpole growth was more strongly associated with cascading effects of warming on gut dysbiosis than with direct warming effects or indirect effects on food resources. These results suggest that assessing warming effects on animal health requires an ecological community perspective on microbiome structure and function.","We thank R. Bell, T. Bernabe, M. Bletz, T.

In this study, I found that within a guild of herbivorous sea urchins, small urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis and small Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) altered grazing rates in the presence of the predatory sea star (Pycnopodia helianthoides) and were highly preferred by the predator. In contrast, large urchins (adult S. franciscanus) did not significantly alter grazing in the presence of cues from the sea star and, when immobile, were less frequently attacked by the predator. However, the sea star's preference (active predator choice) was obscured by sea urchin mobility, that is, small S. franciscanus was only most preferred when unable to escape.

Community interactions link each species' dynamics so that the colonization of one species may cause the extinction of another. In this way, community interactions may set limits to the invadability of an island and to the likelihood of resident species extinctions upon invasion. To examine the nature of these limits, I assemble stable multi‐species Lotka‐Vollerra competition communities that differ in resident species number and the average strength (and variance) of species interactions. These are then invaded with species whose properties are drawn from the same distribution as the residents. The invader success rate and the extinction rate of resident species is determined as a function of community‐and species‐level properties. I show that the probability of colonization success for an invader decreases with species number and the strength and variance of interspecific interactions. Communities comprised of many strongly interacting species limit the invasion possibilities of competing species. Community interactions, even for a superior invading competitor, set up a sort of ‘activation barrier’ that repels the invader. This ‘priority effect’ for residents is not assumed a priori in my description for the individual population dynamics of these species, rather it arises because species‐rich and strongly‐interacting species sets have alternative stable states that tend to disfavour species at low densities. These models point to community‐level rather than invader‐level properties as the strongest determinant of differences in invasion success. If an invading species is successful it competitively displaces a greater number of resident species, on average, as community size increases. These results provide a logical framework for an island‐biogeographic theory based on species interactions and invasions and for the protection of fragile native species from invading exotics.",,,Biological Journal of the Linnean Society,,Oxford University Press (OUP),"0024-4066, 1095-8312",,1991-01,1991,2008-01-14,1991-01,42,1‐2,239-266,Closed,Article,"CASE, TED J.","CASE, TED J.

The experiment separates (1) the main effect of six introduced species, (2) the main effect of eleven resident communities, and (3) the introduction×community interaction. Introduced species differ markedly in their capacity to invade, and only one, Paramecium, invades all of the communities. Most of the introduced species invade some communities, and there is a large introduction×community interaction that comes about from bringing together particular combinations of species. For example, the rate of increase of Amoeba is greater when introduced into communities containing Paramecium than when introduced into communities in which Paramecium is absent. The omnivore Blepharisma increases faster in the presence of one of its prey Tetrahymena, notwithstanding the fact that it is also a potential competitor with this prey for bacteria.

489,pub.1013589663,10.1111/1365-2745.12270,,,,Differentiating genetic and environmental drivers of plant–pathogen community interactions,"Plant genotypic variation can shape associated arthropod and microbial communities locally, as has been demonstrated in controlled common garden experiments. However, the relative roles of plant genetics and the environment in defining communities at larger spatial scales are not well known. The environmental heterogeneity hypothesis maintains that plant genetic effects on associated communities diminish across the landscape as environmental variation predominates. Alternatively, the local adaptation hypothesis argues that plant genetic effects change across landscapes as a result of species interactions being locally adapted. Thus, very different mechanisms could produce similar patterns. Using replicated common gardens located along an elevation and distance gradient, observational studies in the wild, and a greenhouse inoculation experiment, we examined these two non‐mutually exclusive hypotheses for Populus angustifolia and its fungal leaf pathogen community. Supporting the environmental heterogeneity hypothesis, plant genotypic effects on fungal leaf pathogen communities were two to three times stronger within than among gardens. Consistent with the local adaptation hypothesis, plant genotypic effects on pathogens also varied significantly among gardens (i.e. G × E interaction effect). Observational data from the wild and our greenhouse inoculation experiment unveiled clinal adaptation in plant genetic resistance that is correlated with disease risk along the elevation gradient, but did not support local pathogen adaptation to plants or vice versa. Synthesis. While our study found that plant genotype plays a significant role in shaping associated pathogen communities at local and geographic scales, the environment most strongly influenced P. angustifolia leaf pathogens at the geographic scale. Plant genetic effects on pathogens were also influenced by the environment, highlighting the potential for environmental (e.g. climate) change to trigger local evolutionary responses in plant–pathogen community interactions.

Phytoplankton communities have a central role in aquatic food webs and biogeochemical cycles, therefore, consequences of differing community sensitivities may have broad ecosystem effects. Using two long‐term time series (28 and 20 years) from the Baltic Sea, we evaluated coastal and offshore major phytoplankton taxonomic group biovolume patterns over annual and monthly time‐scales and assessed their response to environmental drivers and biotic interactions. Overall, coastal phytoplankton responded more strongly to environmental anomalies than offshore phytoplankton, although the specific environmental driver changed with time scale. A trend indicating a state shift in annual biovolume anomalies occurred at both sites and the shift's timing at the coastal site closely tracked other long‐term Baltic Sea ecosystem shifts. Cyanobacteria and the autotrophic ciliate Mesodinium rubrum were more strongly related than other groups to this trend with opposing relationships that were consistent across sites. On a monthly scale, biotic interactions within communities were rare and did not overlap between the coastal and offshore sites. Annual scales may be better able to assess general patterns across habitat types in the Baltic Sea, but monthly community dynamics may differ at relatively small spatial scales and consequently respond differently to future change.","J.

467,pub.1047746092,10.1007/bf02207829,,,,Comments on the use of a deep tank in planktological research,"The Dalhousie University Aquatron tower tank (10 m deep, 3.66 m in diameter, with viewing ports at regular intervals down its side) can be operated in a continuous flow mode or as a closed system and has programmable illumination providing up to 10% of maximum summer illumination at the surface. Such systems have several drawbacks. Perhaps most serious is the lack of an adequate control. In the continuous flow mode the system is subject to the same type of sampling error encountered in the use of any other sampling device in a patchy environment. Temperature regulation and mixing were a problem with the tank in the static mode. As a result considerable stratification of properties occurred. Irradiance seemed to have too much directionality for normal diel migration patterns to develop in the zooplanktonic community. On the other hand, the system would seem very useful for short-term studies of behaviour and community interaction. For example, the pteropodSpiratella retroversa has been observed to regulate its buoyancy almost instantly. Typically animals remain motionless or slowly sinking (5–20 cm min−1) for 1 to 5 minutes, swim up for 10 to 60s, and then return to “resting” and feeding. Mixed zooplankton populations, including such notoriously delicate animals asSagitta elegans, can also be maintained and behaviour studied. Despite a variable temperature regime, the structure of the zooplankton community remained intact for more than three months.",,,Helgoland Marine Research,,Springer Nature,"1438-387X, 1438-3888, 0017-9957",,1977-08,1977,,1977-08,30,1-4,105-117,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Conover, R.

Wood decomposition in temperate forests is dominated by termites, fungi, and some species of ants and beetles. Outside of urban areas, temperate termite ecology is largely unknown, particularly when compared to tropical termites and other temperate organisms in the functional guild of wood‐decomposing animals. 2. This review combines climate habitat modelling with knowledge of species physiology, behaviour, and community interactions to identify and prioritise future research on temperate termite ecology and biogeography. 3. Using a correlative climate model, the regional distributions of three common temperate forest termite species are shown to correlate with different aspects of climate (e.g. mean versus minimum monthly temperature), but that overall their distributions within temperate systems correlate more strongly with temperature variables than with precipitation variables. 4. Existing data are synthesised to outline how the subterranean, wood‐nesting behaviour of most temperate forest termite species links their activity to an additional set of non‐climate controls: wood type and tree species, soil depth, fungal activity, ant abundances and phenology, and competitive asymmetries among termite species. 5. Although fine‐scale estimates of temperate termite abundances are rare, we provide upper bounds on their ecosystem impacts and illustrate how their regional abundances may influence forest structure and habitat availability for other organisms. 6. This review highlights that rigorous ecological studies in non‐urban, intact ecosystems – with a particular focus on community interactions – are critically needed to accurately project future abundances, economic impacts, and ecosystem effects of temperate forest termites.","We thank Matthew Messenger for his assistance with the National Termite Survey data, and Yoshinobu Hayashi for his assistance identifying temperate forest termites in Japan.

457,pub.1042913202,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.02014.x,,,,Adapt or disperse: understanding species persistence in a changing world,"The majority of studies on environmental change focus on the response of single species and neglect fundamental biotic interactions, such as mutualism, competition, predation, and parasitism, which complicate patterns of species persistence. Under global warming, disruption of community interactions can arise when species differ in their sensitivity to rising temperature, leading to mismatched phenologies and/or dispersal patterns. To study species persistence under global climate change, it is critical to consider the ecology and evolution of multispecies interactions; however, the sheer number of potential interactions makes a full study of all interactions unfeasible. One mechanistic approach to solving the problem of complicated community context to global change is to (i) define strategy groups of species based on life‐history traits, trophic position, or location in the ecosystem, (ii) identify species involved in key interactions within these groups, and (iii) determine from the interactions of these key species which traits to study in order to understand the response to global warming. We review the importance of multispecies interactions looking at two trait categories: thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate and associated life‐history traits and dispersal traits of species. A survey of published literature shows pronounced and consistent differences among trophic groups in thermal sensitivity of life‐history traits and in dispersal distances. Our approach increases the feasibility of unraveling such a large and diverse set of community interactions, with the ultimate goal of improving our understanding of community responses to global warming.","We would like to thank Nico M. van Straalen and six anonymous referees for their valuable comments on earlier versions of the manuscript.

So far, the focus of ecological genetics of invasive alien species (IAS) has been on determining the sources and routes of invasions, and the genetic make-up of founding populations, which is critical for defining and testing ecological and evolutionary hypotheses. However an ecological genetics approach can be extended to investigate questions about invasion success and impacts on native, recipient species. Here, we discuss recent progress in the field, provide overviews of recent methodological advances, and highlight areas that we believe are of particular interest for future research. First, we discuss the main insights from studies that have inferred source populations and invasion routes using molecular genetic data, with particular focus on the role of genetic diversity, adaptation and admixture in invasion success. Second, we consider how genetic tools can lead to a better understanding of patterns of dispersal, which is critical to predicting the spread of invasive species, and how studying invasions can shed light on the evolution of dispersal. Finally, we explore the potential for combining molecular genetic data and ecological network modelling to investigate community interactions such as those between predator and prey, and host and parasite. We conclude that invasions are excellent model systems for understanding the role of natural selection in shaping phenotypes and that an ecological genetics approach offers great potential for addressing fundamental questions in invasion biology.","We are grateful to the IOBC/WPRS for supporting this publication.

457,pub.1106897247,10.1111/jav.01771,,,,Niche theory and its relation to morphology and phenotype in geographic space: a case study in woodpeckers (Picidae),"Ecogeographic analyses have recovered common environmental trends with respect to morphology; however discrepancies among trends exist. Hypothesized reasons for these divergences vary, but most relate a taxon's morphology to its ecological niche. Morphology is known to diverge when species co‐occur with competitors or predators and when species occur across different habitats and environments. A less understood divergence from ecogeographic trends is niche fixation, wherein species become locked into particular niches due to their community interactions or foraging ecology. A form of niche fixation has been hypothesized in the theory of interspecies social dominance mimicry (ISDM), in which mimics maintain relatively constant size ratios with models to perpetuate their mimicry. If true, mimics should display variation and trends in tandem with their models. Here, I use mass as a proxy for body size and examine ecogeographic trends in two sets of woodpeckers (Picidae): a Nearctic group which has been reported to interact via ISDM, and a Neotropical group which, based on similar appearances and overlapping distributions, is a potential ISDM system.

In this research, we tested whether plant/soil community feedback occurs and if increased soil fertility altered the plant/soil community interactions. In two greenhouse experiments we assessed plant and AM fungal performance in response to different soils (and their microbial communities), collected from under three co-occurring plants in serpentine grasslands, and nutrient treatments. The first experiment consisted of two plant species (Andropogon gerardii, Sorghastrum nutans), their soil communities, and three nutrient treatments (control, calcium, N-P-K), while the second experiment used three plant species (first two and Schizachyrium scoparium), their soil communities collected from a different site, and two nutrient treatments (control, N-P-K). Plant/soil community feedback was observed with two of the three species and was significantly affected by nutrient enrichment. Negative Sorghastrum/soil feedback was removed with the addition of N-P-K fertilizer at both sites. Andropogon/soil feedback varied between sites and nutrient treatments, while no differential Schizachyrium growth relative to soil community was observed. Addition of N-P-K fertilizer to the nutrient poor serpentine soils increased plant biomass production and affected plant/soil community interactions. Calcium addition did not affect plant biomass, but was associated with significant increases in fungal colonization regardless of plant species or soil community.

Despite its near ubiquity over much of its range, relatively little is known about its biology during the first year of life.Burbot sac-fry of 3 mm total length, hatched under the ice in early May in Shebandowan Lake. Their first foods following atrophy of the yolk-sac were copepods and cladocerans which they captured pelagically. At first the fry swam in small schools, high in the water column of the near-shore littoral, and fed during the daytime. Upon reaching 30 mm in total length, the burbot fingerlings became solitary and benthic, and fed primarily at night, almost exclusively on the amphipod, Hyalella azteca. Amphipods constituted about 75 per cent by number of all the food consumed by burbot fingerlings in their first year of life. Growth was rapid from May to the end of July, tapered off during August to October, and effectively stopped by November at freeze-up. The principal habitat of burbot fingerlings during the benthic stages of their life was the near-shore littoral, in depths ranging from 0.5 m to 4.0 m. There, they were sheltered by boulder shoals, sunken trees or other debris, or beds of quillworts (Isoetes sp.). The principal ichthyofauna that cohabited with the burbot included the sculpin (Cottus cognatus), the smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieui), two etheostomatines (Etheostoma nigrum) and (E. exile) and the yellow perch (Perca flavescens).

Climate change may alter communities in unexpected ways when environmental drivers have complex effects on individual species that are then transmitted indirectly to other species via biotic interactions.MethodsWe used a multivariate autoregressive (MAR) modeling framework to assess the strengths of intrinsic interactions and extrinsic (environmental) forcing responsible for changes in the zooplankton community of a sockeye salmon nursery lake in southwestern Alaska from 1963 to 2009. During this time period there has been a strong trend towards earlier spring ice breakup dates and warmer summer water temperatures.ResultsMAR analyses of community time-series showed that water temperature was the dominant driver of change in the zooplankton community; competitive interactions were relatively rare, and only copepods (both cyclopoids and calanoids) were affected by predation (juvenile sockeye salmon). Best-fit community models were used to develop scenarios of zooplankton community composition under several different potential climate conditions and salmon densities and revealed the potential for a shift in the dominant zooplankton taxa in this lake, driven largely by taxon-specific sensitivity to climate and sockeye salmon predation.ConclusionsSimulations suggest that cladocerans will become more prevalent in this community and that calanoid copepods will suffer from ongoing climate warming. These results have important implications for fish in these northern lakes, as they suggest that the production of planktivorous fish should increase with ongoing climate change.",,"The Alaska Salmon Program at the University of Washington has been supported by a variety of funding sources over its history, notably the Alaska salmon processing industry, the National Science Foundation, and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.

A dry season (December–April) and a rainy season (May–November) exert a significant impact on its water characteristics. The estuary is the most important fishing ground of Costa Rica, and the main Pacific ports are located within it. Coastal zone development has increased in recent years. In 1979 a research programme to study the Gulf was established at the University of Costa Rica, and foreign scientists were invited to work jointly with local experts to achieve the goals of the evaluation. More than 80 papers have been published to date, making the Gulf one of the best known tropical estuaries. The study of soft-bottom communities is an important component of this research programme. Past benthic research focused on the description of the structure of communities, while future efforts will find an unexplored field in the study of energy flow and community interactions. More than 200 species of fish, and 400 of benthic invertebrates have been identified. Future cooperative research is most welcome in larval ecology, interactions between size groups, and physiological tolerances. Considerable experience has been accumulated in the experimental manipulation of soft-bottom communities of high latitudes. This branch of ecology, however, remains little explored in the tropics.

Multispecies Autoregressive (MAR) modeling can be used to partition effects of variables that are interrelated and temporally autocorrelated in time series from natural systems. Here we address two main questions in applying MAR models to community time series. First, what is the effect of observation scale on interpretation of community dynamics? We used a 10‐year weekly planktonic time series from Lake Washington to construct multiple “biweekly” and “monthly” data sets, and compared resulting community interaction models. Direct abiotic effects and intraspecific autocorrelation were apparent using all data sets. Biotic interactions were more apparent using biweekly and monthly data, indicating that time lags longer than one week were necessary to detect numerical response to interspecific interactions. Second, we examined effects of dropping the winter months from our analyses to simulate the common practice of sampling only during the “growing season” in long‐term ecological studies. We found that biotic interactions remained similarly characterized in models using only non‐winter months, but that the importance of seasonal physical factors nearly disappeared in non‐winter models. Exclusion of winter data in sampling designs may therefore allow us to characterize biotic interactions, although it may not help us understand populations’ relationships to seasonal abiotic variables. The models supported many previous findings from experimental and qualitative investigations of Lake Washington community interactions, implying that MARs provided plausible characterizations of community dynamics, but some previously unconsidered relationships did emerge, such as the importance of cryptomonads and picoplankton for zooplankton growth. We conclude that explicit consideration of time lags in biotic response is necessary to understand relative importance of abiotic and biotic factors, and that sampling regime can therefore strongly influence our interpretations of community dynamics.",,,Oikos,,Wiley,"0030-1299, 1600-0706",,2006-02-16,2006,2006-02-16,2006-06,113,3,424-439,Closed,Article,"Hampton, Stephanie E.; Schindler, Daniel E.","Hampton, Stephanie E.

417,pub.1149355749,10.1002/ecm.1546,,,,Herbivory mediates direct and indirect interactions in long‐unburned chaparral,"Community interaction webs describe both direct and indirect interactions among species. Changes in direct interactions often become noticeable soon after a perturbation, but time lags in the responses of many species may delay the appearance of indirect effects and lead to temporal or spatial variation in interaction webs. Accurately identifying these shifts in the field requires time‐specific, spatially differentiated interaction webs. We explore how variation in browsing affects interaction webs in a long‐unburned chaparral shrubland near the central California coast. Most prior work in chaparral focused on rapid changes for <5 years after a wildfire that were assumed to determine community patterns until the next fire. Here, we report the results of the first 15 years of an ongoing experiment monitoring how interaction webs in long‐unburned chaparral (at least 100 years postfire) respond to experimental variation in browsing by deer and rabbits on dominant shrubs (Arctostaphylos pumila, Ceanothus cuneatus var. rigidus, and Ericameria ericoides). We hypothesized that variation in browsing would directly affect foodplants, indirectly modify growth and survival of other shrubs, and impact habitat needed by herbaceous plants. We found a dynamic web of plant–herbivore and plant–plant interactions that responded rapidly to changes in deer browsing on Ceanothus followed by indirect interactions that continued developing over several years, affecting shrubs, open space, herbaceous plants, and small mammals. Experimental variation in the intensity of deer browsing led to temporal and spatial changes in interactions that produced three different community interaction webs. With deer, community webs were complex, having numerous direct and indirect interactions. Removing deer simplified the community web, changed outcomes of interactions, and reduced open space and herbaceous plant densities. Finally, changes in Ceanothus morphology without deer allowed woodrats to browse these shrubs, with negative impacts on Ceanothus growth and survival. General field observations also showed that all three alternative interaction webs occurred naturally at our fieldsite, varying across space and over time. Long‐unburned chaparral communities browsed by deer maintain high biological diversity, but maintenance of this diversity involves many key direct and indirect biotic interactions.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank the UC Santa Cruz Natural Reserves for support and access to the FONR over many years, particularly Maggie Fusari, Gage Dayton, Grey Hayes, Sean McStay, and Joe Miller.

We hypothesise that shrub growth increases with thermal conditions and precipitation, but that this increase is counteracted by insect herbivory, and that these climate–insect herbivory relationships are modified by both browsing and plant age. We use empirical dynamic modelling (EDM) to analyse a 20‐year time series on willow Salix phylicifolia shoot growth, growing degree days, summer precipitation and herbivory from an experiment at forest–tundra ecotone. The experiment includes manipulations of avian and mammal browsing (fences) and ramet age (pruning to rejuvenate willows). Negative effects of insect herbivory on willow shoot growth were intensified during warmer years, whereas increasing precipitation led to reduced effects. Moreover, the effect of insect herbivores on shoot growth varied with ramet age and vertebrate browsing: younger ramets generally experienced less negative insect herbivore effects, whereas ptarmigan browsing was associated with more positive temperature effects on shoot growth, and reindeer browsing with more negative effects of insect herbivory and precipitation. Synthesis. Our findings show that the negative effects of insect herbivory on shoot growth likely intensify under warmer thermal conditions, but that increasing precipitation can counteract these effects. Moreover, changes in thermal conditions, precipitation and vertebrate browsers all have predictable, albeit complex and nonlinear, effects on shrub growth, highlighting the importance of long‐term experimental data and flexible analytical methods such as EDM for characterising climate and community interactions in artic systems.

Following its introduction into non-axenic K. brevis cultures at concentrations of 103 or 105 bacterial cells per milliliter, 41-DBG2 increased to 106 cells per milliliter before initiation of its algicidal activity. Such threshold concentrations were not achieved when starting algal cell numbers were relatively low (103 cells per milliliter), suggesting that the growth of this bacterium may require high levels of dissolved organic matter (DOM) excreted by the algae. It remains to be determined whether this threshold concentration is required to trigger an algicidal response by 41-DBG2 or, alternatively, is the point at which the bacterium accumulates to an effective killing concentration. The ambient microbial community associated with these algal cultures, as determined by DGGE profiles, did not change until after K. brevis cells were in the process of lysing, indicating a response to the rapid input of algal-derived organic matter. Resistance to algicidal attack exhibited by several K. brevis clones was found to result from the inhibition of 41-DBG2 growth in the presence of currently unculturable bacteria associated with those clones. These bacteria apparently prevented 41-DBG2 from reaching the threshold concentration required for initiation of algicidal activity. Remarkably, resistance and susceptibility to the algicidal activity of 41-DBG2 could be transferred between K. brevis clones with the exchange of their respective unattached bacterial communities, which included several dominant phylotypes belonging to the α-proteobacteria, γ-proteobacteria, and Cytophaga–Flavobacterium–Bacteroides (CFB) groups. We hypothesize that CFB bacteria may be successfully competing with 41-DBG2 (also a member of the CFB) for nutrients, thereby inhibiting growth of the latter and indirectly providing resistance against algicidal attack. We conclude that if algicidal bacteria play a significant role in regulating HAB dynamics, as some authors have inferred, bacterial community interactions are crucial factors that must be taken into consideration in future studies.","The authors wish to thank Christina Mikulski for antibiotic-treated K. brevis cultures originally donated by Dr. K.

In parallel with predation, parasite infection – and even the threat of infection – can alter host traits and indirectly affect community interactions. Nonetheless, few studies have considered multiple mechanisms of natural enemy‐induced behavioural alteration in parallel (e.g. effects before and after enemy contact) or the factors that drive variation in behavioural responses. We first evaluated how the threat of infection by a virulent trematode (Ribeiroia ondatrae) compared to the well studied risk of predation in triggering inducible defences in amphibian hosts, prior to direct contact with either enemy. We then evaluated five separate factors that influenced the magnitude of parasite‐induced behavioural changes after successful transmission. In both the laboratory and an outdoor mesocosm experiment, we found no evidence that tadpoles of two species (Pseudacris regilla and Anaxyrus boreas) altered their activity levels in response to chemical cues from uninfected host snails, trematode‐infected snails, or from conspecifics actively becoming infected. In contrast, tadpoles sharply reduced their activity in response to lethal predation risks posed by caged dragonfly larvae. After infection, however, Ribeiroia caused strong decreases in host activity and escape distance that correlated positively with infection intensity and negatively with host size and developmental stage. Five days after infection with a one‐time pulse exposure, hosts recovered to near‐normal activity levels. Hosts exposed to a chronic daily exposure of equal intensity, however, continued to decrease activity. Unlike Ribeiroia, two less virulent trematodes had no detectable effects on host behaviour. Our results highlight key distinctions between predation and parasitism. The contrasting effects prior to enemy contact may stem from the fact that unlike predation, the consequences of macroparasite infection are intensity‐dependent and unpredictable. In contrast, the strong changes in host behaviour after infection are more similar to non‐consumptive predator effects in terms of their potential influences on host fitness and community interactions.

This study provides evidence for structural variation in fracture density of bedrock as a partial control on tree species distribution in an ultramafic woodland/forest ecosystem. Increases in the number of bedrock fractures correlates negatively with plot-level volumetric soil moisture.

An outdoor mesocosm study in the USA quantified the strengths of direct and indirect interactions between two herbivore congeners that fed on two aquatic plant species while sharing a parasitoid. Kalopolynema ema (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) is a stenophagous native egg parasitoid that attacks the hemipteran species in this study, Megamelus davisi (Hemiptera: Delphacidae), a native herbivore that feeds on the native aquatic species Nuphar advena, and the introduced biological control agent Megamelus scutellaris (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) that feeds on the non‐native aquatic species waterhyacinth, Pontederia crassipes. The presence of M. scutellaris did not significantly increase parasitism of M. davisi indicating that apparent competition was not a factor in this community module. There was no evidence of any trophic cascades caused by these interactions based on the relative growth rates of biomass and leaf area for both plant species. Synthesis and applications. The relative strengths of community interactions varied with herbivore densities suggesting that should negative indirect effects with biological control agents occur they would likely be transient and closely linked to population dynamics as influenced by abiotic factors like temperature. Despite identifying potential negative interactions using path analysis, we saw no apparent competition following the insertion of a weed biological control agent into a community that contains an ecological analog. In this example, the primary negative interaction was biotic resistance to Megamelus scutellaris from attack by Kalopolynema ema. Adopting weed management tactics that emphasize efficacy, sustainability and environmental benevolence argue for the use of classical biological control when appropriate.

Before manipulation this small (1.5 ha) and shallow (1.5 m) lake was characterized byMicrocystis blooms in summer and high chlorophyll-a concentrations were common (ca. 250 µg 1−1). In March 1987 the planktivorous and benthivorous fish species in the lake were completely removed (ca. 1000 kg ha−1), a new simple fish community (pike and rudd) was introduced and artificial refuges were created. The effects of this manipulation on the light climate, nutrient concentrations, phytoplankton, zooplankton, fish, macrophytes, and macrofauna were monitored during 1987, 1988 and 1989. Community interactions were investigated in phytoplankton bioassays and zooplankton grazing experiments. After the manipulation, despite the still high P and N loads to the lake (ca. 2.2 g P m−2 y−1 andca. 5.3 g N m−2 y−1), the phytoplankton density was low (Chl-a<5µg l−1), due to control by large-sized zooplankton in spring and N-limitation in summer and autumn. A marked increase in the abundance of macrophytes and filamentous green algae in 1988 and 1989, as well as N loss due to denitrification, contributed to the N limitation of the phytoplankton. Before manipulation no submerged macro-vegetation was present but in 1988, the second year after manipulation, about 50% of the lake bottom was covered by macrophytes increasing to 80% in 1989. This led to substantial accumulation of both N and P, namely 76% and 73% respectively of the total nutrients in the lake in particulate matter. Undesirable features of the increase in macrophytes were: 1) direct nuisance to swimmers; and, 2) the large scale development of snails, especiallyL. peregra, which may harbour the parasite causing ‘swimmers' itch’. But harvesting of only about 3% of the total macrophyte biomass from the swimmers' area, twice a year, reduced the nuisance for swimmers without adversely affecting the water clarity.",,,Hydrobiologia,,Springer Nature,"1037-0544, 1573-5117, 0018-8158",,1990-08,1990,,1990-08,200-201,1,275-289,All OA; Green,Article,"van Donk, E.; Grimm, M.

Restoration of foundation species promises to counter such losses, despite unknown recovery timelines, undefined benchmarks, and uncertainty about whether restored ecosystems approximate natural ones. Here, we demonstrate through a 15‐year large‐scale experiment in coastal Virginia, USA, that restored oyster reefs can quickly recover multiple ecological functions and match natural reefs. Specifically, abundances of oysters and a key crab mesopredator on restored reefs equaled reference reefs in approximately 6 years, indicating that restoration can initiate rapid, sustained recovery of foundation species and associated consumers. As reefs matured and accrued biomass, they became more temporally stable, suggesting that restoration can increase resilience and may stabilize those ecosystem processes that scale with foundation species biomass. Together, these results demonstrate that restoration can catalyze rapid recovery of imperiled coastal foundation species, reclaim lost community interactions, and help reverse decades of degradation.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND DATA We thank B.

Indirect effects are either mediated by changes in population densities (trophic or density‐mediated effects) or by changes in the behavior of species that are not trophically connected (behavioral or trait‐mediated effects). We reviewed the literature on aphids and their parasitoids to explore the various possible indirect interactions that can occur in such communities. The review was motivated by our study of a particular aphid–parasitoid community in a natural (i.e., nonagricultural) habitat, and by the wealth of information that exists about aphid–parasitoid systems in agricultural settings. We focused our review on aphid–parasitoid interactions, but considered how these were influenced by the other aphid natural enemies and also by aphid mutualists and host plants.

Here, we propose that evolution might commonly alter both local and regional processes of community assembly. We show how adaptation can substantially affect community assembly and that these effects depend on regional (metacommunity) factors, including environmental heterogeneity and its spatial structure. In particular, early colonists can often arrive from a nearby community, adapt to local conditions, and subsequently alter the establishment or abundance of late-arriving species, often producing an evolutionary priority effect. We also discuss how interaction type and relative rates of colonization, evolution, and community interactions determine divergent community outcomes. We describe new conceptual approaches that provide insights into these dynamics and statistical methods that can better evaluate their importance. Overall, we demonstrate that accounting for adaptation during community assembly opens up novel ways for making progress on fundamental questions in community ecology.",,,Annual Review of Ecology Evolution and Systematics,,Annual Reviews,"1543-592X, 2330-1902, 1545-2069",,2022-08-17,2022,2022-08-17,2022-11-02,53,1,299-326,Closed,Article,"Leibold, Mathew A.; Govaert, Lynn; Loeuille, Nicolas; De Meester, Luc; Urban, Mark C.","Leibold, Mathew A.

Integrating exposure (biogeochemistry) and effects (toxicology) into an ecological context requires models as a necessary step to prediction and assessment of effects on populations and their interactions. To this end, research is being conducted to develop techniques for predicting the effects of Se on aquatic ecosystems. The objective is to develop mechanistic models to predict biogeochemical cycling, toxicological processes, and toxic effects on population and community dynamics. Earlier research demonstrated that different chemical forms of Se have different toxicological properties. Biogeochemical research culminated with a dynamic model of the Se cycle. In ongoing research, experiments are being conducted on microorganisms, phytoplankton, microzooplankton, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, and fish to measure uptake, biotransformation, and depuration kinetics of different chemical forms of Se, transfer through the food web, and effects on growth, reproduction, community interactions, and survival.

We show that different facets of the ecology associated with vector-host-host interactions affect the structure of the three-species assemblage. Crucially, the patterns associated with invasion of alternative hosts, the spread of the infectious disease by the vector, and the dynamics of the community interactions are influenced by the mode of transmission.

Understanding the factors that affect zooplankton community responses in the face of environmental change is an important goal if ecologists expect to make predictions regarding the impact of current and future stressors. The acidification and recovery of lakes provides a well‐studied example of the impacts of environmental change. For this study, we conducted a field enclosure experiment using zooplankton communities that are recovering from the effects of acidification to determine whether dispersal levels, Allee effects and biotic interactions could influence comˋmunity responses as pH levels increase. The experiment involved the introduction of four acid‐sensitive colonist species (Daphnia retrocurva, Skistodiaptomus oregonensis, Epischura lacustris and Tropocyclops extensus) into enclosures stocked with recipient communities. The experiment was a factorial design with colonists introduced at three starting densities (low, medium and high) and enclosures being stocked with either diverse communities typical of neutral lakes or relatively depauperate communities dominated by the acid‐tolerant copepod Leptodiaptomus minutus. Per capita growth rates (r) for colonist species were measured by sampling communities in enclosures over a 10‐week period. Factorial anovas were conducted to determine whether r differed according to starting densities, recipient community type or their interaction. Our results indicated that r for the copepods E. lacustris and S. oregonensis were greater when introduced at high initial densities, suggesting an Allee effect based on mate limitation. In addition, r for S. oregonensis was lower when introduced to acid communities, suggesting biotic interactions with the resident community were important for this species. Per capita growth rates for T. extensus and D. retrocurva did not differ among treatments. Synthesis and applications. These results suggest that community response to environmental change can be influenced by dispersal, Allee effects and community interactions. Studies evaluating the ongoing recovery of zooplankton communities from acidification, or their response to other stressors, should take these factors into account. If rapid community responses are desired, dispersal rates for sexual zooplankton species (copepods) may need to be artificially increased.

388,pub.1004401634,10.2307/3236276,,,,A functional classification for predicting the dynamics of landscapes,"Abstract. Functional classifications have been derived for various purposes using subjective, objective and deductive approaches. Most of the classifications were derived to describe a static state of a region or landscape rather than to predict the dynamics of the system. Here, we suggest a simple, but comprehensive functional classification based on life history parameters that can predict the dynamics of plant communities subject to recurrent disturbances. The predicted dynamics are described in terms of survival and local extinction of the functional groups. The groups derived from the classification are probably largely independent of functional groupings that may be derived for other aspects of community composition (e.g. structure, phenology) and community interactions (roughness, albedo etc.). We emphasize that functional classification is context‐dependent and we should not expect to find a useful, universal classification into functional groups. Software has been developed to help classify the species into functional groups, to derive successional sequences and to predict community composition under different disturbance regimes both in point and landscape models.",,,Journal of Vegetation Science,,Wiley,"1100-9233, 1654-1103",,1996-06,1996,2009-02-24,1996-06,7,3,329-336,Closed,Article,"Noble, Ian R.; Gitay, Habiba","Noble, Ian R.

As researchers in these fields continue to share broad and overlapping interests, converging on one system could allow for a better understanding of community interactions and the chemical substances that mediate them. Cucurbit systems are strategically positioned to study these types of interactions because they combine the elements of plant–herbivore, plant–predator, and plant pollinator into one model and are systems where researchers can pursue both basic and applied questions. In this review, we propose Cucumis sativus [cucumber], Acalymma vittatum [striped cucumber beetle], Celatoria setosa [a natural enemy], and generalist pollinators as a system for continued investigation into semiochemicals, their multifunctional roles, and their influence on both target and nontarget organisms.

Thus, predicting when cyanobacteria are abundant and when their toxins have elevated concentrations is potentially dependent on a large suite of variables. We used a large spatial and temporal scale study to identify the best environmental predictors of microcystin concentrations in lakes and reservoirs in Ohio (Midwest USA). Additionally, we explored predictive models for a censored dataset that included phytoplankton community composition and abiotic characteristics of lakes and their watersheds. We found that lakes had elevated microcystin concentrations when phytoplankton biomass was high and when lakes had small watershed areas relative to lake surface areas, and that biovolume of potential toxin producers and phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) both predicted microcystin concentrations. Seasonal patterns in microcystin concentrations suggested that a single annual sampling may miss microcystin maxima and, contrary to expectations, a late summer maximum in microcystin was not universal.","We thank E.

In the present paper, we study the press perturbation, where the death rate d of a target species is altered and held at higher or lower levels. Lattice Lotka–Volterra model (LLVM) is applied to know response of ecosystem. We also apply the theory of perturbation expansion to both mean-field and pair approximations (PA). Both computer simulation for lattice model and perturbation expansion theory reveal that the density of the target species takes the maximum value at a non-zero value of d. Extreme decrease of death rate leads to its density decrease: avoidance of death in the target species indirectly causes not only decrease of its prey but also increase of predators. An evolutionary meaning of the optimized death rate is discussed. Especially, we describe ecological apoptosis: individuals or organisms have a positive meaning of death.","The author is grateful to Professors Jin Yoshimura, Yoh Iwasa and Kenichi Aoki for valuable discussions.",,Ecological Modelling,,Elsevier,"0304-3800, 1872-7026",,2003-05,2003,,2003-05,163,1-2,73-85,Closed,Article,"Tainaka, Kei-ichi","Tainaka, Kei-ichi (Department of Systems Engineering, Shizuoka University, Hamamatsu 432-8561, Japan)","Tainaka, Kei-ichi (Shizuoka University)","Tainaka, Kei-ichi (Shizuoka University)",Shizuoka University,grid.263536.7,Shizuoka,,Japan,,,,,,6,0,,0.41,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1021835421,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,B10 Mathematical Sciences,

A potential mechanism for this replacement is competition mediated by resident species. Other Eurasian invaders, dreissenid mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena bugensis), dominate rocky substrates throughout the system and might be promoting the rapid expansion of E. ischnus by providing habitat and refugia from predation. Using an in-situ predator-exclusion experiment, we tested the hypothesis that E. ischnus is better able than G. fasciatus to use Dreissena spp. colonies as refugia and thus is less susceptible to predators in the St. Lawrence River. Co-occurring E. ischnus and G. fasciatus showed similar increases in density in the presence of Dreissena spp., in spite of E. ischnus having evolutionary experience with Dreissena spp. Predators reduced the density of both amphipod species, but E. ischnus was more susceptible to predation on dreissenid substrates, which suggests that predation mediates the coexistence of G. fasciatus and E. ischnus in the river.",,,Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences,,Canadian Science Publishing,"0706-652X, 1205-7533",,2005-05-01,2005,,2005-05-01,62,5,1111-1118,Closed,Article,"Palmer, M E; Ricciardi, Anthony","Palmer, M E (); Ricciardi, Anthony ()",,"Palmer, M E (); Ricciardi, Anthony ()",,,,,,,,,,,22,1,,1.53,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1017292190,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,C14 Geography and Environmental Studies,

The maximum abundance of A. priodonta was limited to the summer months with temperature being the only significant predictor of abundance. Intrinsic rate of growth and abundance of the three species were independent from each other suggesting the absence of trophic interactions. In Lake Windsborn, A. priodonta was a grazer rather than a predator. Its diet included high proportions of colonial algae and cyanobacteria which cannot be ingested by the other abundant zooplankton species, whereas zooplanktonic food were rarely found.

Agricultural intensification by means of habitat and floral resource loss is thought to be one of the leading causes of wild bee population deterioration. This study examined multiple agricultural land use systems in New Hampshire to determine how wild bee biodiversity and community interactions are affected by different land use practices. A total of 2292 wild bees were collected during these surveys, representing 112 species. A high species overlap was found at all land use systems, although all sites had some species exclusivity. Land use significantly affected species abundance and richness. The moderately managed sites supported both the greatest pollinator abundance and species richness, while the low management sites had the smallest abundance and the same level of richness as the high management sites.

However, satellite data are currently underused within the biodiversity research and conservation communities. Three factors have significant impact on the utility of remote sensing data for tracking and understanding biodiversity change. They are its continuity, affordability, and access. Data continuity relates to the maintenance of long-term satellite data products. Such products promote knowledge of how biodiversity has changed over time and why. Data affordability arises from the cost of the imagery. New data policies promoting free and open access to government satellite imagery are expanding the use of certain imagery but the number of free and open data sets remains too limited. Data access addresses the ability of conservation biologists and biodiversity researchers to discover, retrieve, manipulate, and extract value from satellite imagery as well as link it with other types of information. Tools are rapidly improving access. Still, more cross-community interactions are necessary to strengthen ties between the biodiversity and remote sensing communities.","The German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the German Group on Earth Observations (D-GEO) sponsored a workshop at DLR entitled “Satellite Remote Sensing for Biodiversity Research and Conservation Applications: A Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Workshop” in October 2012, which provided the initiative and much content for this Perspective.",,Biological Conservation,,Elsevier,"0006-3207, 1873-2917",,2015-02,2015,,2015-02,182,,173-176,All OA; Green,Article,"Turner, W.; Rondinini, C.; Pettorelli, N.; Mora, B.; Leidner, A.K.; Szantoi, Z.; Buchanan, G.; Dech, S.; Dwyer, J.; Herold, M.; Koh, L.P.; Leimgruber, P.; Taubenboeck, H.; Wegmann, M.; Wikelski, M.; Woodcock, C.","Turner, W.

Here, we present selected principles from community ecology and discuss these in relation to fungal entomopathogens. We discuss the relevance of apparent competition, food web construction, intraguild predation and density-mediated and trait-mediated indirect effects. Although current knowledge of community interactions involving fungal entomopathogens are limited, fungal entomopathogens can be important, interactive members of communities and the activities of fungal entomopathogens should be evaluated in the context of ecological principles. We also discuss aspects of metapopulation ecology and the application of these principles to fungal entomopathogens.

All models of self‐thinning assume that the trajectory is independent of the initial pre‐thinning density, so populations differing in initial density can be analysed together. As plant allometry is a determinant of the self‐thinning trajectory, and competition alters plants' allometric growth, initial density may have consequences for the self‐thinning trajectory. To ask whether initial density can influence allometric relationships and the biomass–density trajectory, we grew Fagopyrum esculentum populations at three high densities and measured shoot biomass, density and the height and diameter of individual plants at six harvests. Initial density did not affect the slope of the log biomass–log density relationship, but there was a clear and significant effect on the intercept. Populations sown at higher densities had significantly more biomass at a given density of survivors. If the data for all densities and harvests are analysed together, the log biomass–log density relationship is linear with a slope of −0.377, which is consistent with the predictions of Metabolic Scaling Theory. If the independent variable initial density is included as a factor, the estimated slope of the log B–log N relationship is much steeper and consistent with the classical ‘Self‐thinning Rule’. The position of the self‐thinning trajectory is determined in part by the biomass density: the relationship between mass and volume. Initial density could affect this by altering allometric growth in a way that influences architectural compactness. An alternative hypothesis is that competition at higher initial density is more size symmetric, which has been shown to reduce growth and mortality. Synthesis. The self‐thinning trajectory is not always independent of initial population density. Interpopulation scaling patterns, even within one species, do not reflect processes within populations, and this conflation lies behind much of the current debate about size–density relationships in plant populations and communities. Interactions among plants and allometry are more important than internal physiological scaling mechanisms in determining the self‐thinning trajectory of crowded stands.

Here we describe a new experiment that aims to determine the impacts of elevated concentration of CO2 ([CO2]) and elevated temperature on a native Themeda–Austrodanthonia-dominated grassland ecosystem in south-eastern Tasmania. The experimental site contains 60 vascular plant species. The experiment combines the latest developments in free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) technology with the use of infrared (IR) heaters to mimic environmental conditions expected to exist in the year 2050. The CO2 concentration in the FACE treatments is reliably maintained at 550 µmol mol–1 and leaf temperature is elevated by an average of 2.1°C by the IR treatment, with 1-cm soil temperature being elevated by 0.8°C. Measurements being made in the experiment cover plant ecophysiological responses, plant population dynamics and community interactions. Soil processes and ecosystem effects, including nutrient cycling and plant animal interactions, are also being investigated. Collaborations are invited from interested parties.","The TasFACE facility is the result of a collaboration between the University of Tasmania, Australia, and the Istituto di Biometeorologia, Italy.

Rather, individuals differ among systems, with important implications for population demographics and community interactions. For widely distributed assemblages made up of poikilotherms with high first-year mortality, species-specific differences in growth reaction norms as affected by both temperature and genotype will influence biotic interactions. For a broadly distributed fish assemblage, first-year growth does not vary with latitude for a planktivorous prey species, but declines with increasing latitude for a terminal piscivore. Size-based competitive interactions between these species are likely to be more intense at high latitudes, as they spend an extended time sharing resources during early life. Such patterns probably are pervasive and must be considered when seeking to understand species interactions. Improving our knowledge of how temperature and local adaptations affect size-based interactions should enhance our ability to manage and conserve widespread assemblages.","We thank two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments that improved the manuscript.

Burning of fossil fuels, pollution, deforestation, and production of pesticides and fertilizers have elicited climate change (global warming) and have inadvertently disturbed the ecosystem balance. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) which are widely distributed in terrestrial ecosystems form a mutualistic interaction known as arbuscular mycorrhiza(AM) with the roots of most land plants. Their contribution to ecosystem functioning by regulating plant function, nutrient uptake, stress resistance, and community interactions is noteworthy. Different studies have suggested that an increase in temperature, carbon dioxide enrichment, and increased nutrient deposition in the ecosystem which is the result of imprudent human activities strongly impact the colonization, diversity, and function of AMF in the terrestrial ecosystems. This review briefly describes the responses of AMF to different climatic factors and their consequences on host plant functioning and productivity. Understanding the dynamics of plant-fungal associations in the context of global climate change will help in designing strategies to alleviate detrimental anthropogenic impacts to protect AMF diversity and consequently ecosystem functioning and its sustainability.",,,Microbial Science Archives,,Science Archives,"2583-1666, 25831666",,2022,2022,2022,2022,02,02,14-20,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Mohanty, Aparajita; Mishra, Reema","Mohanty, Aparajita (); Mishra, Reema ()",,"Mohanty, Aparajita (); Mishra, Reema ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,https://doi.org/10.47587/msa.2022.2201,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150739829,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3107 Microbiology,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,13 Climate Action; 15 Life on Land; 2 Zero Hunger

Its suitability for measuring general microbial activity in groundwater was tested by examining the relationship of tensile strength, abundance of cellulolytic organisms and general microbial activity on cotton strips deployed in bores. The hypothesis was that the strength of cotton strips would decline with increasing abundance and activity of cellulolytic organisms, and as cellulolysis makes resources available to other microbial groups, cotton strength loss should also be related to increased overall microbial activity. The correlation between the abundance of cellulolytic organisms and cotton strength was not significant. Two main factors influenced this relationship: (i) effectiveness of the media in detecting cellulolytic moulds and (ii) inter-community interactions. After accounting for the presence of moulds through partial correlation, the relationship between tensile strength and abundance of cellulolytic organisms was stronger and significant. Both cotton strength and abundance of cellulolytic organisms correlated significantly with general microbial activity. These results support the use of the cotton strip assay, and cotton tensile strength as a surrogate for microbial activity in groundwater.","The authors gratefully acknowledge Kerrie Hannigan and Norman Booth for technical support.

Both yellowedge, Epinephelus flavolimbatus, and snowy grouper, E. niveatus, were observed utilizing shelter around rock ridge habitats. The yellowedge grouper also sought shelter within three types of burrows cut into soft sediment. Many of these burrows were significant excavations consisting of large trenches 7–8 m long, 2–3 m wide, and 1–1.5 m deep. Burrows were found in depths from 265 to 290 m. Tilefish, Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps, also occur at this site, usually inhabiting the characteristic vertical burrows already described for this species. In four daytime submersible transects covering a linear distance of over 13000 m, we observed a total of 66 yellowedge groupers. Twenty-five were in burrows, 39 among rocks, and two over open bottom. It is suggested that this species may have an advantage over congeners that utilize only rocky habitat for cover.

This review provides information of climate change‐related impacts on the marine benthos in the North Atlantic. We cover a number of related research aspects, mainly in connection to two key issues. First, is the relationship between different physical aspects of climate change and the marine benthos. This section covers: (a) the responses to changes in seawater temperature (biogeographic shifts and phenology); (b) altered Hydrodynamics; (c) ocean acidification (OA); and (d) sea‐level rise‐coastal squeeze. The second major issue addressed is the possible integrated impact of climate change on the benthos. This work is based on relationships between proxies for climate variability, notably the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, and the long‐term marine benthos. The final section of our review provides a series of conclusions and future directions to support climate change research on marine benthic systems.

However, the lack of integration between ecology and climate science has restricted understanding of the available climate data and their appropriate use. We provide an overview of climate model outputs and issues that need to be considered when applying projections of future climate in ecological studies. We outline the strengths and weaknesses of available climate projections, the uncertainty associated with future projections at different spatial and temporal scales, the differences between available downscaling methods (dynamical, statistical downscaling, and simple scaling of global circulation model output), and the implications these have for ecological models. We describe some of the changes in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), including the new representative concentration pathways. We highlight some of the challenges in using model projections in ecological studies and suggest how to effectively address them.

The changes in the canopy species composition and their effect on the composition and arrangement of the moss layer were analysed. The share of pine in the number of trees decreased markedly over the study period. Instead, numerous species of trees, casting deep shade on the forest floor vegetation (fir, spruce, beech and oaks), encroached the tree-stands. A similar tendency of changes took place in the shrub layer: a decrease in the percentage contribution of light demanding and moderately light demanding tree species and an increase in the shade-tolerant ones. In contrast, the changes in the moss layer were mainly quantitative, but they were essentially related to the transformation in the tree stand. The considerable increase in the proportion of broadleaved species in the tree stand and understorey and, in consequence, a high cover of broadleaved litter greatly inhibited the development of terricolous bryophytes characteristic of coniferous forests.",,,Annales Universitatis Mariae Curie-Sklodowska sectio C – Biologia,,Maria Curie-Sklodowska University,"0066-2232, 2083-3563",,2009-01-01,2009,,,64,2,23-34,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Maciejewski, Zbigniew; Zubel, Robert","Maciejewski, Zbigniew (Roztocze National Park, Plażowa 2, 22-470 Zwierzyniec, Poland1); Zubel, Robert (Department of Botany and Mycology, Institute of Biology, Maria Curie-Skłodowska University, Akademicka 19, 20-033 Lublin, Poland2)",,"Maciejewski, Zbigniew (Roztocze National Park); Zubel, Robert (Maria Curie-Skłodowska University)",Maria Curie-Skłodowska University; Roztocze National Park,grid.29328.32; grid.475902.d,Lublin; Lublin,; ,Poland; Poland,,,,,,3,0,,0.33,,https://doi.org/10.2478/v10067-010-0011-z,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1000867634,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3007 Forestry Sciences; 31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 41 Environmental Sciences",,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,

It is often reported that the rhizosphere of different plant species selects their PGPR community, which promotes the growth of some more than others. In this greenhouse study using the same agricultural soil, we assessed the PGPR community in the rhizosphere of important plant species, including two cultivars (maize and cowpea) and one landrace (lima bean). The PGPR community structure differed between the rhizosphere the landrace and the cultivars, which presented similar community structures. The rhizosphere of lima bean showed exclusive PGPR groups (Streptomyces, Soliruborbacter, and Methylobacter), which are involved in resistance and stress tolerance in plants. The rhizosphere of both cultivars presented a similar relative abundance of Bacillus and Paenibacillus, groups involved in plant growth promotion by the production of antibiotics and biological N fixation. In addition, the cultivars presented more proportion of specialist microbes, and the community interaction was more complex than the landrace. The findings of this study expand the knowledge of the PGPR community in distinct plant species and confirm the significant effect of landraces and cultivars on rhizobacteria community selection.","The authors acknowledge Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico – CNPq (grant 305069/2018–1), and Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior – CAPES (Code 001).

376,pub.1038401413,10.1007/bf03186248,,,,Gall insect-host plant relationships—An ecological perspective,"Compared to other phytophagous insects, the gall insects are specialised in view of their imperative demand for a particular type of food in terms of a specific host; this is further supported by their specialised trends in establishing a coordinated, functionally efficient system involving (i) the biogenesis of the host plant organ, and (ii) the life-cycle of the gall-maker. The ’inherent potential’ (genetic-?) of the gall-insect to establish an independent, yet a discrete habitat, modifying the host plant tissue to enjoy a self-contained nutritional guild, facilitated by the host selection patterns, appears especially different from the other non-cecidogenous phytophages.Besides the autecological factors such as the changing climate, chemical and physical changes in the host tissue, and patchyness of food plant resources, which are of great importance to the cecidogens, of particular significance are the community interactions within gall systems involving many arthropod participants like inquilines, parasites, predators, and other casual visitors. As specialised organisms and with limited population size per unit area, the gall insects seem to run the risk of random extinction, although their efficient development of strategies to survive appears significant.",,,Proceedings: Animal Sciences,,Springer Nature,0253-4118,,1984-06,1984,,1984-06,93,4,293-300,Closed,Article,"Raman, A","Raman, A (Entomology Research Institute, Loyola College, 600 034, Madras, India)","Raman, A (University of Madras)","Raman, A (University of Madras)",University of Madras,grid.413015.2,Chennai,Tamil Nadu,India,,,,,,3,0,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1038401413,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,A05 Biological Sciences,

Caprella penantis densities were 23 times greater when T testudinum died back during the winter than when T. testudinum was more dense. Observations made during seasonal collections indicate that most fish predators of C. penantis are absent during the winter. Caprella penantis densities may have been decreased by fish predation, but the density increases were due to reproductive output. When C. penantis densities on sea whips decreased, postlarval and juvenile decapod crustaceans colonized the sea whip. The reptantians remained on the sea whips through several molts and then dropped from the sea whips to join the benthic macrofaunal community. Epibiotic communities, therefore, have been demonstrated to be involved in at least three important marine ecosystems processes: (1) they serve as a concentrated and recognizable food source for nekton, (2) epibionts graze periphyton and detritus from the biotic substratum, thereby preventing smothering, and (3) some benthic invertebrates temporarily join the epibiotic community during their transition from planktonic to epibenthic life styles.",,,Journal of Crustacean Biology,,Oxford University Press (OUP),"0278-0372, 1937-240X",,1983-01-01,1983,,1983-01-01,3,4,iii-504,Closed,Article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028527419,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,

A biofilm is a complex aggregation of microorganisms marked by the excretion of a protective and adhesive matrix. Biofilms are also often characterized by surface attachment, structural heterogeneity, genetic diversity, complex community interactions, and an extracellular matrix of polymeric substances. Biofilms have been found to be involved in a wide variety of microbial infections in the body, by one estimate 65% of all infections. Infectious processes in which Biofilms have been implicated include common problems such as urinary tract infections, catheter infections, middle-ear infections, formation of dental plaque, gingivitis, coating contact lenses, and less common but more lethal processes such as endocarditis, infections in cystic fibrosis, and infections of permanent indwelling devices such as joint prostheses and heart valves.

Between May and September in 2011 the number, composition, and diversity of flower visiting insects were assessed across eight sites, representing a range of habitats within an industrial site in the North East of England, UK. There was no significant difference in insect assemblages between the sites selected, but there was a significant difference between the months surveyed. Flower density was highlighted as the most important factor driving these changes between months and indicates that flower density is more important to a site for insect diversity than the presence of specific habitats. Analysis of the insect communities each month allowed comparison of dominant insects to the flower density data, highlighting sites where management intervention could be initiated to benefit insect diversity, or alternatively specific management plans to encourage target species. Furthermore, this study highlights the importance of correct data interpretation to answer specific management objectives and recommends analysing the insect community interactions to determine the dominant species present prior to undertaking any management of the site in question.",,,International Journal of Ecology,,Hindawi,"1687-9708, 1687-9716",,2013,2013,,2013,2013,,1-12,All OA; Gold,Article,"Scriven, L.

Melanoplus femurrubrum grasshoppers in NE Connecticut are missing from grass dominated fields. I examined two hypotheses about why the grasshopper is missing from these types of fields in this region. The first hypothesis was that behavioural responses to predation and competition prevent establishment by limiting above ground stages of the grasshopper. The second hypothesis was that soil temperature and grass habitat characteristics influence oviposition behaviour and limit egg development. Testing among these different hypotheses (trophic vs abiotic), data from experiments and field observations indicated that while the within field distribution of M. femurrubrum can be sensitive to the effects of trophic interactions during the above ground phase of the life‐cycle, the among field distribution is limited by female oviposition choice, limited heating degree‐days for egg development, and poor resource conditions for the first instar grasshoppers.

Inquiline ants were present in 10 % of Microcerotermes biroi nests and in 4 % of Nasutitermes princeps nests. Live termite nests inhabited by the most common inquiline ant, Camponotus sp. A, were generally left by the ant after several months. In some nests, Camponotus sp. A was observed coexisting with its host during the whole observation period (3 years). Therefore, Camponotus sp. A was apparently an opportunistic inquiline which did not affect significantly the mortality of termite colonies. The arboreal-nesting ant, Crematogaster irritabilis, was locally found occupying up to 99 % of the trees present in 1 ha plots. In such hot spots, the overall abundance of termites was approximately half that of plots devoid of Crematogaster irritabilis. The high density of Crematogaster irritabilis may be an important limiting factor for the termite assemblage, by hastening the death or hindering the establishment of arboreal termite colonies.",,,Insectes Sociaux,,Springer Nature,"0020-1812, 1420-9098",,1999-05,1999,,1999-05,46,2,126-130,Closed,Article,"Leponce, M.; Roisin, Y.; Pasteels, J.

In western countries pioneering the oceanic energy utilization, wave is currently an attractive energy source due to the predictability and the ease to be absorbed into power grid. As wave-energy generators (WEGs) and the associated devices interact with the surrounding environment, they would have impacts on the biological components within the ecosystem in the vicinity of WEGs. However, the environmental effects of offshore WEGs on local fauna and flora have yet to be evaluated in a comprehensive way. This article discusses several aspects, including influence of offshore WEGs on marine macrofaunal communities, interactions between offshore WEGs and biofouling organisms, impacts of offshore WEGs on marine birds and of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) on marine animals as well as “artificial reef” effects. If precaution is taken with the planning and construction of offshore WEGs, and environmental monitoring is performed with operation of these devices, marine wave energy can become a desirable alternative to fossil fuels.",This work is co-supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (41076054) and Jiangsu Natural Science Funds (BK2008321).,,Acta Ecologica Sinica,,Elsevier,"1000-0933, 1872-2032",,2012-06,2012,,2012-06,32,3,117-122,Closed,Article,"Lin, Lan; Yu, Haitao","Lin, Lan (Dept. of Bioengineering, Medical School, Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, China); Yu, Haitao (School of Electrical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing 210096, China)","Yu, Haitao (Southeast University)","Lin, Lan (Southeast University); Yu, Haitao (Southeast University)",Southeast University,grid.263826.b,Nanjing,,China,National Natural Science Foundation of China,,China,grant.4996979,41076054,33,12,,4.19,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050226676,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3007 Forestry Sciences; 31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology",,,,,,B12 Engineering,13 Climate Action; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy

We attempted to identify the degree of genetic control of tree phenology and growth of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Mchx.) in a natural stand of this species in northwestern Quebec. We mapped and genotyped 556 aspen trees growing within the plot, using seven nuclear microsatellite loci for clone identification. We selected 13 clones (n of trees per clone >5, in total 350 trees) and evaluated the explanatory power of clone identity in (a) variability of spring leaf phenology and (b) short‐ and long‐term growth responses. The clone's identity explained 43% of the variability in spring leaf phenology, between 18% and 20% of variability in response to monthly climate variables significantly affecting growth, between 8% and 26% of growth response to insect outbreaks, and 12% in the long‐term growth rates. Strong clonal control of aspen phenology and moderate control of growth responses to monthly weather do not result in an equally large impact on long‐term growth rates. The result suggests an important role of environmental extremes and within community interactions as factors averaging aspen growth performance at the stand level.","The study was supported by FRQNT (grant PR‐191194 to FT) and CRSNG (grant 150680937 to YB).

We evaluated multivariate hypotheses about abiotic and biotic factors shaping biological soil crusts (BSCs) in early and late successional stages. We surveyed vegetation and BSC in the shrub-steppe ecosystem of the Columbia Basin. We analyzed the relationships with bryophyte and lichen covers using structural equation models, and analyzed the relationships with BSC composition using Indicator Species Analysis and distance-based linear models. Cover, indicator species, and composition varied with successional stage. Increasing elevation and bryophyte cover had higher lichen cover early in succession; these relationships were negative in the later successional stage. Lichen cover did not appear to impede B. tectorum cover, but B. tectorum appeared to strongly negatively affect lichen cover in both stages. Biological soil crust composition varied with bunchgrass cover in the early successional stage, but with elevation and B. tectorum cover later in succession. Our findings support the hypotheses that as succession progresses, the strength and direction of certain community interactions shift, and B. tectorum leads to reductions in biological soil crust cover regardless of successional stage.","G.

366,pub.1004749979,10.1016/j.algal.2016.09.004,,,,Assessing the potential of polyculture to accelerate algal biofuel production,"To date, the algal biofuel industry has focused on the cultivation of monocultures of highly productive algal strains, but scaling up production remains challenging. Algal monocultures are difficult to maintain because they are easily contaminated by wild algal strains, grazers, and pathogens. In contrast, theory suggests that polycultures (multispecies assemblages) can promote both ecosystem stability and productivity. A greater understanding of species interactions and how communities change with time needs to be developed. Ultimately a predictive model of community interactions is needed to harness the capacity of biodiversity to enhance productivity of algal polycultures at industrial scales. Here we review the agricultural and ecological literature to explore opportunities for increased annual biomass production through the use of algal polycultures. We discuss case studies where algal polycultures have been successfully maintained for industries other than the biofuel industry, as well as the few studies that have compared biomass production of algal polycultures to that of monocultures. Assemblages that include species with complementary traits are of particular promise. These assemblages have the potential to increase crop productivity and stability presumably by utilizing natural resources (e.g. light, nutrients, and water) more efficiently via tighter niche packing. Therefore, algal polycultures show promise for enhancing biomass productivity, enabling sustainable production and reducing overall production costs.","This authors gratefully acknowledge partial funding support from the DOE/EERE Bioenergy Technologies Office.

366,pub.1121010017,10.1002/ecs2.2863,,,,Habitat coupling mediates trophic cascades in an aquatic community,"Trophic cascades and other indirect effects can significantly mediate community interactions. Movement of energy between systems has been shown to be important for trophic cascades in food webs, where coupling between habitats can be important for food web stability and species evenness. To investigate the effects of habitat coupling on the stability and dynamics of chlorophyll a (used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass), mediated by the abundance and composition of zooplankton and macroinvertebrates, we manipulated habitat use by the predator perch. We show a greater indirect effect of predation on phytoplankton abundance when no habitat coupling occurs, indicating a stronger predation effect and a decrease in zooplankton grazing pressure leading to an increase in phytoplankton biomass. Although we found a significant effect on chlorophyll a between the treatments, this effect was not evident in the abundance of prey resources of perch (zooplankton and macroinvertebrates). Other indirect effects, not measured in this study, such as compositional changes in prey groups, could potentially explain the lack of effect in prey resources. While there is a strong theoretical argument for the stabilizing effects of habitat coupling, empirical evidence is scarce. Our study offers tentative support for these theoretical predictions in a natural system.","We thank J Malmberg, K Karlsson, S Eklöv, I Eklöv, X Thibert‐Plante, D Shen, Y Zha, A Aussanasuwannakul, E Breed, M Breed, W Breed, I Bernhardsson, and J Alcalde for help in the field and the laboratory.

We investigated the consequences of removing large individuals of two functionally contrasting benthic communities on nutrient regeneration, microphyte standing stock, and macrobenthic community composition. The experiment was conducted at two adjacent sites that were physically similar but biologically different, one dominated by large deposit feeders and the other by large suspension feeders. Chemical fluxes were measured in experimental plots, and sediments were sampled to assess changes in macrofauna, sediment grain size, organic content, and microphyte standing stock. Our results demonstrate that the removal of large suspension feeders or deposit feeders influenced the flux of nitrogen and oxygen, surficial sediment characteristics, and community composition. In the deposit-feeder community, interactions between nutrient regeneration and grazing highlight important feedbacks between large macrofauna and biogeochemical processes and production by microphytes, indicating that the loss of large infauna driven by increased rates of anthropogenic disturbance may lead to functional extinction and cause shifts in community structure and ecosystem performance.","This research was funded by the Foundation for Research Science and Technology (New Zealand) (CO1X0018, CO1X0307).

Species interact with other species to create communities, which derive from species interactions and from the interactions of species with the scale specific elements of the landscape that provide suitable habitat and exploitable resources. I used logistic regression analysis to sort among potential intrinsic, community and landscape variables that theoretically influence introduction success. I utilized the avian fauna of the Everglades of South Florida, and the variables body mass, distance to nearest neighbor (in terms of body mass), year of introduction, presence of congeners, guild membership, continent of origin, distribution in a body mass aggregation or gap, and distance to body-mass aggregation edge (in terms of body mass). Two variables were significant predictors of introduction success. Introduced avian species whose body mass placed them nearer to a body-mass aggregation edge and further from their neighbor were more likely to become successfully established. This suggests that community interactions, and community level phenomena, may be better understood by explicitly incorporating scale.",,,Biological Invasions,,Springer Nature,"1387-3547, 1573-1464",,2006-04,2006,,2006-04,8,3,491-500,All OA; Green,Article,"Allen, Craig R.","Allen, Craig R.

Few studies considered all components of the pelagic MFW in freshwaters and mostly are from temperate regions. We investigated carbon partitioning in the CFC and the MFW in an Amazonian floodplain system and analyzed the strength of interactions among components through structure equation modeling. We hypothesized that (i) MFW contributes highly to total plankton biomass throughout the year; and (ii) all plankton communities increase in biomass during low water, increasing the role of trophic interactions. We collected 30 subsurface samples (nutrients and plankton communities). MFW predominated over CFC in carbon biomass, and plankton components and their interactions changed according to the contrasting water level. Because phosphorus can be a potentially limiting resource for strict primary producers, higher biomass and a more complex MFW occurred during low water. We concluded that hydrology is a key factor shaping biotic interactions during low-water periods, and that MFW plays a key role in floodplain lakes, being potential mixotrophy an important strategy for phytoplankton.","We express our gratitude to Raimundo and Rongelina for providing access to the lake and sometimes much more.

Three alternative models, the passenger, the driver, and the opportunist were used to determine the interactions between the invasive species, the native community, and features of the habitat. To assess the relationships between soil properties and species composition of a Scots pine forest invaded by P. serotina, we randomly selected twelve research plots in each of four stands in the south-western part of Poland. We used the phytosociological relev method and determined selected soil properties (total nitrogen, organic carbon, and pH value) in the organic and humus horizons. Based on redundancy analysis, we determined that selected soil properties explained 38% of the total variation in species composition of the Scots pine forest with P. serotina, indicating that community interactions followed the passenger model. At the same time, we found that P. serotina invaded via the driver model, since the decrease in soil C:N ratio correlated with black cherry presence, and showed a significant impact on the floristic diversity in the invaded phytocenoses. We conclude that soil parameters seem to facilitate the invasion of P. serotina, and comprise the consequences of this process.",,,Polish Journal of Ecology,,Museum and Institute of Zoology at the Polish Academy of Sciences,"1505-2249, 2450-1395",,2017-06,2017,,2017-06,65,2,295-302,Closed,Article,"Halarewicz, Aleksandra; Pruchniewicz, Daniel; Kawako, Dorota","Halarewicz, Aleksandra (Department of Botany and Plant Ecology, Wroc, aw University of Environmental and Life Sciences, pl.

Long-term monitoring has been recognized as a necessity for elucidating population trends and community interactions, particularly for long-lived species or ecosystems with slow rates of change. We examine seasonal and annual cycles of morphological changes in a threatened, long-lived, insular reptile, the tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus), on Stephens Island, New Zealand. We used body condition indices as a surrogate measure of fitness, and examined seasonal fluctuations, using data from an intensive mark-recapture study, and long-term trends using a dataset that spans 54 years. In spite of seasonal and annual fluctuations, body condition of tuatara has declined significantly between 1949 and 2003; the decline was only evident after >22 years of monitoring. We hypothesize that increasing numbers of tuatara have resulted in a density-dependent population response driven by past habitat modification on Stephens Island. We emphasize the need for long-term monitoring and suggest that potentially costly management decisions, particularly for long-lived species or ecosystems with slow rates of change, should not be based solely on short-term monitoring.","Thanks to A.

Communities with identical species composition can depict distinct networks due to different levels of disturbance as well as physical and biological processes. In this study we reconstruct community networks in four different areas off the Oregon Coast by matching simulated communities with observed dynamics. We compared reserves with harvested areas. Simulations suggested that different community networks, but with the same species composition, can represent each study site. Differences were found in predator–prey interactions as well as non-predatory interactions between community members. In addition, each site can be represented as a set of models, creating alternative stages among sites. The set of alternative models that characterize each study area depicts a sequence of functional responses where each specific model or interaction structure creates different species composition patterns. Different management practices, either in the past or of the present, may lead to alternative communities. Our findings suggest that management strategies should be analyzed at a community level that considers the possible consequences of shifting from one community scenario to another. This analysis provides a novel conceptual framework to assess the consequences of different management options for ecological communities.","We thank the volunteer divers from the Oregon Department of Fishes and Wildlife, Oregon State University, National Marine Fishery Service, University of Oregon, and the Oregon Coast Aquarium.

Empirical studies collect data with increasing resolution and provide greater opportunities for its testing. However, several different density-dependent habitat selection models exist in the literature incorporating many different scenarios. We attempt to unify some of these models in a single framework, to increase our predictive power, and assist researchers in making predictions from combinations of these models. To achieve this, we created the generalized ideal free distribution, an expansion of the ideal free distribution model. With this model, we synthesize many of the previous theoretical developments in habitat selection to better incorporate temporal dynamics. By using community matrices to represent the interaction between individuals, we demonstrated that thirteen scenarios represented in other studies can be combined into a single model. In addition, for four of these scenarios, our predictions are similar to the original studies that developed these scenarios. Additionally, we derived four novel predictions that take advantage of using community matrices to represent distribution. We discuss how this model creates a connection between community interactions and the distribution of individuals, and its uses in other subjects in ecology.","Work was supported by Israeli Science Foundation [grant number 976/14] to BPK.

A total of 13399 organisms, belonging to 5 Phyla, were identified by Visual Census. The surveyed stations showed biodiversity values and evenness that depend, above all, from the edaphic features and water exchange of the different tidal ponds. Tidal ponds characterized by a lower water exchange showed a faunal assemblage characterized by the presence of species tolerant to a wide temperature and salinity range, as Mugil cephalus, Clibanarius erythropus and Phorcus turbinatus. The pools with the most water exchange showed the highest abundance and evenness values; while the ponds characterized by hard bottom showed this feature as strong influence on the species composition.

The results showed that bedding material (CK-0, S1-40%, S2-25%) optimized the composting conditions for lignocellulose and OM biodegradation. The highest OM degradation and humic substance (HS) synthesis rates were observed in the 40% BM addition group. Firmicutes was more abundant in the bedding material addition groups, whereas Proteobacteria was more abundant in the group without bedding material. Functional prediction showed higher carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism in the BM groups than that in control group. Animal and plant pathogens were almost eliminated, and saprotrophs were the dominant fungal trophic modes after 40% BM addition composting. Cellulose, hemicellulose, and organic matter had strong associations with microbial communities, such as Lysinibacillus and Corynebacterium (bacteria), compared to the associations of Aspergillus, Candida, and Sordariomycetes (fungi) (p value < 0.05). Network analysis revealed closer microbial community interactions in 40% BM addition group than in other groups.

Although the utilization of a variety of substrates has been studied for individual metabolically versatile microorganisms, only little is known about the response of microbial communities toward substrate fluctuation. Here, we exposed a phototrophic co-culture (Rhodopseudomonas sp. and Chlorobium sp.) that was isolated from a littoral freshwater sediment to a variety of substrates (acetate, Fe(II), or H2) and followed the abundance of individual microbial partners based on their characteristic light absorption pattern. Chlorobium sp. dominated the culture when Fe(II) was supplied, whereas Rhodopseudomonas sp. decreased below detection. Rhodopseudomonas sp. dominated when the co-culture was transferred onto acetate (Chlorobium sp. below detection). When grown on H2, the dominance pattern depended on pre-culture conditions. Pre-cultures on Fe(II) or acetate resulted in dominance of Chlorobium sp. or Rhodopseudomonas sp., respectively. Although the relative abundance of the two partner strains strictly relies on substrate availability, we were incapable of isolating Chlorobium sp. from the co-culture.

Community interactions should increase understanding of effective pedagogies and provide help in planning applications. Creating online assignments that generate substantive interactions among a large number of teachers during asynchronous online discussions (AODs) is challenging. AODs have rich content (ideas, resources, and practices), wide breadth (engaging significant numbers of participants), and substantial depth (multiple layers of “back and forth” comments). Online discussions document and quantify the content, breadth, and depth of teacher conversations. In the APS Frontiers in Physiology PD program AODs, that were part of the teacher assignments, indicated that only those teachers who were among the first to post in a discussion had substantive responses attached to their posting. In this study, discussion assignments were restructured to promote AODs on initial postings by all teachers, even those who post later in the AODs.

Droughts, more than any other phenomena, have shaped and influenced rural communities' interaction with their environment on which they eke a living. The physical aspect of droughts and their effects are well known, but the often subtle and complex dynamics emanating from drought outbreaks are less understood among communities. A study was conducted during the 2009/2010 season to investigate how communities in Kgalagadi North and Bobonong Sub-districts perceive droughts, anticipate droughts and which sections of the respective communities were most vulnerable to drought shocks. An extensive agro-ecological knowledge base, in form of environmental indicators, was used by communities to predict imminent droughts. Preparations included storing excess crop harvests during good years, storing crop residues for livestock, buying commercial feed to supplement livestock and seeking alternative sources of income outside the agricultural sector. In spite of these efforts, drought still affected the communities negatively mainly through increased livestock mortalities and crop failure-especially among poorer households. Subsequently, it is recommended that any effective aid interventions ought to understand and appreciate these dynamics to enhance resilience to future droughts and ensure sustainable rural development.","The authors are grateful to the Department of Agricultural Research (Botswana) who provided logistical help during the field trips.

We studied an experimental gradient of plant species richness for a better understanding of plant–pollinator community interactions and their temporal variability, because in non‐experimental field surveys plant richness is often confounded with gradients in management, soil fertility, and community composition. We observed pollinator species richness and frequency of visits six times in 73 plots over two years, and used advanced statistical analysis to account for the high number of zeroes that often occur in count data of rare species. The frequency of pollinator visits increased linearly with both the blossom cover and the number of flowering plant species, which was closely related to the total number of plant species, whereas the number of pollinator species followed a saturation curve. The presence of particularly attractive plant species was only important for the frequency of flower visits, but not to the richness of pollinators. Plant species richness, blossom cover, and the presence of attractive plant species enhanced the temporal stability in the frequency of pollinator visits. In conclusion, grasslands with high plant diversity enhance and stabilize frequent and diverse flower visitations, which should sustain effective pollination and plant reproduction.","We thank the many people who helped with the management of the Jena‐experiment, especially the field coordinator Alexandra Weigelt and the gardeners Steffen Eismann, Silke Hengelhaupt, Sylvia Junghans, Ute Köber, Katja Kunze, Gerlinde Kratzsch, Heike Scheffler and Ulrike Wehmeier.

While many studies have focused on the processes and consequences of a focal foundation species, understanding the ecological equivalence of co‐occurring foundation species is important to identify key species responsible for ecosystem function. Here, we investigated the relative contributions of co‐occurring foundation species on abiotic (temperature) and biotic responses of invertebrate species (recruitment, persistence, growth and survival). In a series of experimental field studies, we manipulated foundation species to measure invertebrate recruitment, persistence, and predation. A laboratory experiment measured foundation species effects on herbivore growth. Results demonstrated that macroalgal (Fucus vesiculosus ecad and Ascophyllum nodosum ecad scorpioides) intermediate foundation species provide habitat, food, and alleviate abiotic stress for dominant littorinid herbivores that surpass that provided by the primary species (Spartina alterniflora). These foundation effects were species‐specific with F. vesiculosus ecad important for early life‐history stages (enhanced recruitment and early growth of littorinid snails) and A. nodosum ecad important later on as a refuge from predators (Carcinus meanas) and stressful temperature. Understanding of the different effects of co‐occurring foundation species on population and community processes is necessary for predicting community response to natural disturbance, species invasion, and ecosystem‐based management actions.","We would like to thank Danielle Girard, James Davis, Catherine Buchalski, Thais Fournier, and Hannah Lynch for their assistance with field and laboratory work.

We studied three sites along a rural–urban gradient in the Seattle metropolitan area with three sampling periods from 2009–2011 to examine how arthropod communities respond to increasing levels of urbanization in a similar habitat type through time. Consistent with previous studies, urban areas contained altered environmental conditions relevant for litter arthropods, and arthropod biodiversity decreased with urbanization. However, urban arthropod biodiversity was not influenced by environmental measures, supporting the idea of an “urban-filter”. Urbanization was not a factor influencing how communities responded to the effect of time, suggesting that other factors (e.g. disturbance) may ultimately be more important for determining patterns of biodiversity through time in urban areas. Finally, our study illustrates urbanization forces can structuring entire arthropod communities similarly through time, having important consequences for our understanding of urbanization’s temporal effects and indirect influence on community interactions and ecosystem processes. As the effects of urbanization will inevitably vary through time, we suggest that multiple time point studies are required to increase our ability to accurately describe arthropod community responses to increasing urbanization.","We thank the M.J.

Mysid crustaceans, key planktivores and fish prey in aquatic food webs, frequently undertake diurnal vertical migrations, but there are limited reports of horizontal movements. Using seasonal and diurnal field surveys in Lough Derg on the Shannon River (Ireland), we tested the hypotheses that (i) the euryhaline mysid Mysis salemaai expands seasonally its horizontal distribution and that (ii) the diurnal pattern of vertical migration within the shallows overlaps with the introduced mysid Hemimysis anomala. M. salemaai, previously considered an exclusively offshore species, changed its horizontal distribution significantly with seasons, being restricted to ≥8 m in summer and extending to all depths in winter. During winter, the distribution of M. salemaai overlapped with H. anomala in shallows and there was a highly significant overlap in their diurnal emergence in the open water, indicating a strong temporal synchrony of planktonic foraging. The seasonal range expansion of M. salemaai is likely to have important implications for horizontal redistribution of nutrients. Interactions with the sympatric H. anomala are likely, adding to existing physico-chemical pressures on the glacial relict M. salemaai and potentially contributing to its further extirpations.","Authors would like to acknowledge Kevin Gallagher and Áine Murphy for contributing distribution records, Magda Gluza, Danny O’Neill and Mark Emmerson for assistance in the field, Deirdre McClean and Adam Kane for useful discussions and John Brophy for help with the manuscript.

Fifteen years after the Mesoamerican Reef System was implemented as an international conservation strategy, a study was done to determine local population interest in reef conservation in San Miguel de Cozumel, Mexico, and West End Village, Honduras. An evaluation was also done of coral health in nearby, heavily used reefs. Lack of community participation is linked to low levels of information, education and training, although 90% of interviewees agreed to participate in a contingent proposal involving financing of coral reef conservation activities. Participants exhibited a willingness-to-pay an average of 10% of income spent on basic food needs or the national minimum wage. Their willingness stemmed from the use value of the reefs as a tourist attraction and from their being a primary income source.Among non-use values, ensuring the well-being of their children (i.e. legacy value) was the most frequently stated followed by conserving reefs because they are a natural system (i.e. existence value). The reef coral health indicated some degree of reef deterioration compared to indicator values for the Mesoamerican Reef System.

Florivory, which is less studied but as equally widespread as herbivory, can have effects on plant and floral trait adaptations, individual fitness, and community interactions. However, there are still knowledge gaps in our understanding of florivory, including the role of neural constraints and diet specialisation of florivores in floral resource utilisation. 2. According to the neural constraint hypothesis, a generalist flower‐visiting katydid is expected to have lower decision‐making efficacy in feeding when subjected to the presence of both capitula and leaves, compared to the presence of either one of the two resources. 3. In the present study, experiments using the katydid, Phaneroptera brevis, and the plant, whiteweed, Ageratum conyzoides, were carried out to examine the foraging behaviour of the katydid to test our hypothesis. The results confirmed the prediction of the neural constraint hypothesis. 4. The decision‐making efficacy was generally lowered when the katydid was presented with the choice for both the resource that is preferred (capitula) and less preferred (leaves). It was also shown that Phaneroptera brevis is floriphilic, as it prefers capitula to leaves. 5. In conclusion, the first evidence of neural constraint in florivory is provided and suggests that more can be explored into the effects of neural constraints and diet specialisation in floral resource utilisation.","M.K.T. thanks Matthew L.

On the other hand, how intraspecific plant interactions influence communities of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is still very poorly understood.MethodsWe applied 454 pyrosequencing to determine the responses of AMF communities to intraspecific shoot and root interactions using Medicago sativa L. as host plant.ResultsWe found that intraspecific plant interaction caused significant variation in the structure of the AMF community assessed from roots but not from soil. Intraspecific root system interaction resulted in significantly elevated AMF species richness, greater total mycorrhizal and arbuscular colonization, and a larger root:shoot ratio compared to plants experiencing intraspecific shoot interaction or no interaction. Intraspecific shoot interaction resulted in significantly depressed AMF species richness.ConclusionsOur results support two hypotheses. The first is that increased AMF species richness in plants experiencing intraspecific root interaction originates from competitive release provided by high root density. The second is that shoot interaction leads to reduced allocation to root systems, increasing the stringency with which host plants selectively reward the most cooperative fungi. Because intraspecific interactions among host plants can influence the structure of their AMF community, interactions among species in complex plant communities may influence AMF community structure in addition to a plant diversity effect.",This work was supported by the Central Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund (CAFYBB2019QB001) and the Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31870099).,,Plant and Soil,,Springer Nature,"0032-079X, 1573-5036",,2021-04-22,2021,2021-04-22,2022-01,470,1-2,141-152,Closed,Article,"Zhang, Qian; Koide, Roger T.; Liu, Junxiang; Li, Zhenjian; Sun, Zhenyuan; Sun, Qixiang; Yang, Haishui","Zhang, Qian (Research Institute of Forestry, Chinese Academy of Forestry, No.1, Dongxiaofu, Xiangshan Road, Haidian District, 100091, Beijing, China); Koide, Roger T.

There are many possible reasons for this, but one novel explanation is that species adapt to changes in temperature at the expense of adaptation to other stressors. Here we test this hypothesis using the limpet Patella depressa (Mollusca, Patellidae), over a large geographical area covering most of the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula, known to consist of a genetically inter‐connected population. We examine limpet shell morphology on four shores in each of three regions, from Northern Spain to Southern Portugal. Within each region, shell morphology (measured as maximum shell profile to length ratio) varied between shore types differing in their insolation, wave action, microhabitat availability and biological factors. However, this ratio, which is known to be an adaptive response to heat stress, was found to be consistently higher in more southern latitudes despite differences between shore types being found in all regions. This implies that localized adaptation to shore type (most likely through phenotypic plasticity) is compromised by factors that change over latitudinal or regional scales, or which could occur in response to climate change. Although such climate‐induced changes may initially be localized, compromised adaptation (through phenotypic or genetic plasticity) may result in altered community interactions and potentially large shifts in community structure.",,,Marine Ecology,,Wiley,"0173-9565, 1439-0485",,2017-12-08,2017,2017-12-08,2017-12,38,6,e12472,Closed,Article,"Hines, Hunter N.; Morriss, Hannah; Saunders, Karen; Williams, Rachel L.; Young, Sarah L.; Stafford, Richard","Hines, Hunter N.

Yet monitoring these movements are technically very challenging. During the last few decades, radars have increasingly been used to study the aerial movements of birds, bats and insects, yet research efforts have often been local and uncoordinated between research groups. However, a network of operational weather radars is continuously recording atmospheric conditions all over Europe and these hold enormous potential for coordinated, continental-scale studies of the aerial movements of animals.The European Network for the Radar surveillance of Animal Movement (ENRAM) is a new e-COST research network aiming exactly at exploring this potential. The main objective of ENRAM is to merge expertise to utilize weather radars to monitor the aerial movement of animals across Europe for a broad range of stakeholders at an unprecedented scale and enable researchers to study the causes and consequences of movement. In this paper we describe the aims of ENRAM in more detail and the challenges researchers will address, provide an overview of aero-ecological studies using radar, and present some of the opportunities that a large sensor network can provide for movement ecology research.","The authors would like to thank everyone involved in the ENRAM network for discussions at earlier meetings held at the University of Amsterdam, Rothamsted Research and Institute of Avian Research, preceding the e-COST Action.

Floodwaters have caused severe coral mortality in many near-shore coral reefs throughout the world. However, previous studies have largely ignored the effects of floodwaters on macroalgae and calcified algae and the indirect effects on benthic community interactions following flood events. In October 2010, heavy rainfall of more than 1600 mm in 9 days caused the largest flood on record in eastern Hainan Island. Long-term video transects indicate that the floodwater was responsible for severe benthic community mortality in Wenchang, northeast Hainan Island. Mean live coral cover decreased from 15.2% to 9.8% and showed strongest degradation at stations proximal to areas with a high density of aquaculture ponds (i.e. stations 3S–4S decreasing from 15.0% to 0.8%). Branching corals (Acropora and Pocillopora damicornis) were the most sensitive, while massive corals (e.g. Porites, Galaxea, Platygyra and Favia) were most tolerant of floodwaters. Calcified algae were almost completely removed at all stations; coverage decreased from 28.1% to 1.7%, while macroalgae were not influenced by floodwaters. Thus, remnant coral communities that survived the flooding in Wenchang are likely to be subject to increased competition with macroalgae and benefit less from calcified algae promoting juvenile coral recruitment.",,"Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (40830850, 41106141, 40931160437 and 41106107), the National Key Technology R&D Program (2009BAB44B01), the Open Research Fund of the State Key Laboratory of Estuarine and Coastal Research (SKLEC-KF201307) and the Ocean Public Welfare Scientific Research Project (201005012-6 and 201105012-2).

In Utah, the Bear Lake strain of Bonneville Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii utah and tiger trout (female Brown Trout Salmo trutta × male Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis) are being more frequently added to a traditional stocking regimen consisting primarily of Rainbow Trout O. mykiss. Interactions between these three predatory species are not well understood, and studies evaluating community interactions have raised concern for an overall decrease of trout condition. To evaluate the potential for negative interactions among these species, we tested aggression in laboratory aquaria using three‐species and pairwise combinations at three densities. Treatments were replicated before and after feeding. During the three‐species trials Rainbow Trout initiated 24.8 times more aggressive interactions than Cutthroat Trout and 10.2 times more aggressive interactions than tiger trout, and tiger trout exhibited slightly (1.9 times) more aggressive initiations than Cutthroat Trout. There was no significant difference in behavior before versus after feeding for any species, and no indication of increased aggression at higher densities. Although Rainbow Trout in aquaria may benefit from their bold, aggressive behavior, given observations of decreased relative survival in the field, these benefits may be outweighed in reservoirs, possibly through unnecessary energy expenditure and exposure to predators.

In this paper, we take a mosquito-centric approach by studying mosquito states (i.e., energy, neurological health, and toxin information state) to demonstrate how key parameters of malaria, biting and movement rates and mosquito survival, are all emergent properties of those states when considered in the context of the background community interactions. We do so as follows: First, we develop a dynamic state variable model of mosquito biting and movement decisions that maximize mosquito expected reproductive success (fitness), and then we embed those optimal policies in a Monte Carlo simulation wherein mosquitoes attempt to feed on human hosts at domiciles where insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) and insecticidal residual wall sprays (IRSs) are used. We find that biting rates, at the domicile level, are not impacted by mosquito state but that emigration rates from domiciles are determined by an interaction between mosquito energy state, information state, and risk of predation. This means that malaria incidence, at the village level at least, may be best understood as a response of mosquitoes to their ecological community that includes nectar-bearing plants, predators, the spatial arrangement of homes, and the protection of humans in those homes.",,,Israel Journal of Ecology and Evolution,,Brill Academic Publishers,"1565-9801, 2304-7976, 2224-4662",,2010-05-06,2010,2010-05-06,,56,3-4,297-312,Closed,Article,"Roitberg, Bernard D.; Mangel, Marc","Roitberg, Bernard D.

Biogeographic patterns in microbial communities relate to dissimilarity in microbial community function, meaning novel litters to communities may decompose differently than predicted from their chemical composition. Therefore, the effect of a litter species in the biogeochemical cycle of its current environment may not predict patterns after migration. Under a tree migration sequence we test whether litter quality alone drives litter decomposition, or whether soil communities modify quality effects.MethodsLitter and soils were sampled across an elevation gradient of different overstory species where lower elevation species are predicted to migrate upslope. We use a common garden, laboratory microcosm design (soil community x litter environment) with single and mixed-species litters.ResultsWe find significant litter quality and microbial community effects (P < 0.001), explaining 47 % of the variation in decomposition for mixed-litters.ConclusionSoil community effects are driven by the functional breadth, or historical exposure, of the microbial communities, resulting in lower decomposition of litters inoculated with upslope communities. The litter x soil community interaction suggests that litter decomposition rates in forests of changing tree species composition will be a product of both litter quality and the recipient soil community.","This research was funded by the U.S. Forest Service through a cooperative agreement to MAB and JK, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency through a Science to Achieve Results (STAR) Fellowship to ADK, and the U.S. National Science Foundation through the Coweeta Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Program.

356,pub.1139872692,10.1002/lno.11901,,,,Sulfur isotope fractionations constrain the biological cycling of dimethylsulfoniopropionate in the upper ocean,"The rapid turnover of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), likely the most relevant dissolved organic sulfur compound in the surface ocean, makes it pivotal to understand the cycling of organic sulfur. Dimethylsulfoniopropionate is mainly synthesized by phytoplankton, and it can be utilized as carbon and sulfur sources by marine bacteria or cleaved by bacteria or algae to produce the volatile compound dimethylsulfide (DMS), involved in the formation of sulfate aerosols. The fluxes between the consumption (i.e., demethylation) and cleavage pathways are thought to depend on community interactions and their sulfur demand. However, a quantitative assessment of the sulfur partitioning between each of these pathways is still missing. Here, we report for the first time the sulfur isotope fractionations by enzymes involved in DMSP degradation with different catalytic mechanisms, expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli. We show that the residual DMSP from the demethylation pathway is 2.7‰ enriched in δ 34S relative to the initial DMSP, and that the fractionation factor (34ε) of the cleavage pathways varies between −1 and −9‰. The incorporation of these fractionation factors into mass balance calculations constrains the biological fates of DMSP in seawater, supports the notion that demethylation dominates over cleavage in marine environments, and could be used as a proxy for the dominant pathways of degradation of DMSP by marine microbial communities.","Acknowledgments We thank Dan Tawfik and Lei Lei (Weizmann Institute of Science), and William Whitman and Joe Wirth (University of Georgia, Athens), who kindly provided us the recombinant E. coli strains with DMSP lyases and DmdA, respectively.

The ecological effects of urbanization on regional, local and site-specific spatial variations of benthic macrofauna and of sediment and water properties were investigated in relatively pristine rivers and in urban rivers of southern Brazil. The benthic communities were found to be different in urbanized and protected areas. Their predominant responses to environmental conditions were characterized as either a: (i) sensitive species assemblage, formed by polychaetes Nephtys fluviatilis and Heteromastus similis and the crustacean Kalliapseudes schubarti; or a (ii) tolerant species assemblage, formed by the polychaete Laeonereis acuta and by an unidentified oligochaeta Tubificidae. The relationships between fauna and environment differed between protected and urban rivers. In protected areas the fauna distribution was directly related to grain sorting and phaeophytin a in sediments; and to chlorophyll a, dissolved oxygen and phosphorus in water. In urban sites the strongest determinants of fauna distribution were the presence of lead, copper, dissolved phosphorus, chlorophyll a and phaeophytin a in sediments, and suspended particulate matter, dissolved phosphorus, nitrogen, and silicate in water. The comparison of animal–sediment–water interaction in natural and urban areas can be useful in planning environmental impact mitigation strategies for conservation even in rivers and estuaries with non-point sources of pollution.","This study was partially supported by the Brazilian National Research Council (CAPES), WWF⧹Brazil and UNESCO⧹MAB.

The shift in emphasis from single species to ecosystem conservation is revealing how community interactions can potentially influence single species viability and conservation. Although there is much theory and empirical data concerning the dynamic consequences of exploitative interactions, there is still a very poor understanding of the effects of interference interactions. Recent studies, as shown in this review, have documented widespread effects of such interactions among mammalian carnivores. Harassment, loss of kills and intraguild predation have been documented in a wide range of species. The demonstrated effects also include avoidance of larger carnivores in both time and space and reductions in one species density or even total exclusion from certain habitats or regions. Our review of the literature thus provides a range of empirical examples that together demonstrate that these interactions have very important implications on carnivore demography. We believe that the effects of interference might differ strongly from the effects of exploitative competition. This is because interference might have the potential to affect population growth in an inverse density‐dependent manner and thereby also reduce population growth at low densities, therefore increasing extinction probabilities. These factors need to be considered when planning future multi‐species conservation. Further research into the temporal and spatial aspects of co‐existence are required if diverse guilds and communities are to be conserved.","The preparation of this review has been spread across several projects, funded at various times by the Norwegian Research Council, the Directorate for Nature Management and the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research.

Recent advances in ecological science have greatly contributed to our understanding of the effects of soil conditions on plant community dynamics and our understanding of plant composition impacts on almost every aspect of soil structure and function. Although these theories provide important guidelines for the practice of restoration, they often fall short of providing the level of information required to make effective site‐specific management decisions. This is largely because of ecology’s search for simple unifying theories and the resulting tendency to generalize from studies at one or only a few sites. An average effect or broad‐scale simple relationship tends to provide a “one‐size‐fits‐all” (or none) prescription for managers. Plant–soil interactions can vary greatly depending on their context (e.g., environmental conditions, management practices, time, neighboring community, interaction with other organisms). The ability to predict these context‐dependent interactions between plants and soils can be developed by building upon existing general frameworks for understanding plant–soil interactions. Collaborations between researchers and managers can develop conceptual tools that allow us to understand and manage the variability and complexity of plant–soil interactions, simultaneously advancing theory and applicability.","We thank Mac Callaham and two anonymous reviewers for comments that greatly improved the manuscript, and Mac Callaham, Liam Heneghan, and Chuck Rhoades for organizing the symposium, conference, and special issue that led to the writing of the manuscript.",,Restoration Ecology,,Wiley,"1061-2971, 1526-100X",,2008-11-26,2008,2008-11-26,2008-12,16,4,713-729,Closed,Article,"Eviner, Valerie T.; Hawkes, Christine V.","Eviner, Valerie T.

Understanding and predicting the fates of populations under global change, including extinctions and geographical range shifts, requires analysing the interplay of these processes, which has long been a grey area in evolutionary biology. We review recent theory on the interaction of phenotypic plasticity, genetic evolution and demography in environments that change in time or space. We then discuss the main limitations of the models and the difficulties in testing theoretical predictions in the wild, notably regarding changes in phenotypic selection, the evolution of (co)variances of reaction norm parameters, and transient dynamics. We use two landmark examples of physiological responses to climate change –trees facing drier climate and extreme temperatures, and marine phytoplankton under rising CO2 – to highlight relatively neglected questions and indicate the theoretical and empirical challenges that they raise. These examples illustrate notably that age‐specific patterns of plasticity and selection on the one hand, and changes in community interactions and functioning on the other hand, need to be further investigated theoretically and empirically for a better understanding of evolutionary demographic responses to climate change in the wild.

Knowledge regarding the use of mercury and the dynamics of complex environmental, health, socioeconomic, and cultural conditions in and surrounding small-scale mining sites is particularly needed for the purpose of developing appropriate community-based measures to reduce mercury-related problems. GMP strategies aim to build upon local knowledge and practices to train miners on the use of cleaner and affordable technologies of mining and mineral processing in order to minimize negative impacts. The initiative is especially proactive in facilitating transdisciplinary and participatory models of community interaction, involving local, regional, and international stakeholders in each of the strategy design, community assessment, and community intervention phases. The six participating countries are Brazil, Indonesia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Sudan, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe.

Public health concerns and demand for clean energy provide impetus to the development of wastewater based MFC. Wastewater treatment and simultaneous generation of bioelectricity offer a myriad of environmental benefits. Nevertheless, it is pertinent to know the challenges with the microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology to upscale the wastewater based MFC. This paper attempts to critically analyse the processes, application, challenges and opportunities of wastewater based MFCs. A literature survey was conducted to find out the advances in the field of wastewater based MFCs and the focus was to decipher the challenges to the implementation of wastewater based MFCs. Recent developments in MFC technology have improved the power output and studies show that a diverse group of organic-rich wastewater can be treated with MFCs. The developments include improvements in MFC configuration, development of biocatalysts and biocathode, anodic biofilm formation, microbial community interactions, and progress in the organic and pollutant removal. Nevertheless, the MFC technology is replete with challenges about the organic removal rate, power density, electrode performance limiting factors, economic viability, high initial and maintenance cost and difficulty to maintain the exoelectrogens activity in a complex wastewater environment. Opportunities exist in scaling up of MFCs, integration with other wastewater treatment methods and measures to minimise the operating costs. MFCs have the potential to increase the resilience capacity of the sustainable wastewater treatment plant.",,,The Open Biotechnology Journal,,Bentham Science Publishers,1874-0707,,2021-07-08,2021,,2021-07-08,15,1,131-141,All OA; Gold,Article,"Venkatramanan, V.; Shah, Shachi; Prasad, Ram","Venkatramanan, V.

Biodiversity may also influence invasibility of communities because of more complete use of resource types with increasing species richness. We hypothesized that communities with higher environmental productivity and lower species richness should be more invasible by a competitor than those where productivity is low or where richness is high. We experimentally examined the invasion resistance of herbivorous meiofauna of Jamaican rock pools by a competitor crustacean (Ostracoda: Potamocypris sp. (Brady)) by contrasting three levels of nutrient input and four levels of species richness. Although relative abundance (dominance) of the invasive was largely unaffected by resource availability, increasing resources did increase the success rate of establishment. Effects of species richness on dominance were more pronounced with a trend towards the lowest species richness treatment of 2 resident species being more invasible than those with 4, 6, or 7 species. These results can be attributed to a ‘sampling effect associated with the introduction of Alona davidii (Richard) into the higher biodiversity treatments. Alona dominated the communities where it established and precluded dominance by the introduced ostracod. Our experimental study supports the idea that niche availability and community interactions define community invasibility and does not support the application of a neutral community model for local food web management where predictions of exotic species impacts are needed.",,,Biological Invasions,,Springer Nature,"1387-3547, 1573-1464",,2006-01-16,2006,2006-01-16,2006-06,8,4,655-664,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Beisner, Beatrix E.; Hovius, Jonathan; Hayward, April; Kolasa, Jurek; Romanuk, Tamara N.","Beisner, Beatrix E.

For the most part, inconsistent relationships between local rarity and underlying mechanisms have emerged. One possibility for this inconsistency is that locally rare species may not always be rare. However, it is largely unknown whether most locally rare species in a community possess the capacity to become abundant elsewhere in their geographical range. Here, we identified 57 locally rare plant species of open forest in south‐eastern Australia. We found that most of these species (91%) occurred in higher abundance at other sites within their geographical range (somewhere‐abundant species), while the remaining small percentage of locally rare species were consistently rare (everywhere‐sparse species). Somewhere‐abundant species had significantly smaller seeds on average than everywhere‐sparse species in cross‐species regression analysis. This pattern was not maintained when the influence of other life‐history attributes was controlled for, or when phylogenetic relatedness among species was considered explicitly in phylogenetic regression analysis. In both cross‐species and phylogenetic regressions, somewhere‐abundant and everywhere‐sparse species did not differ significantly with respect to growth form, height, regeneration‐after‐fire strategy, or dispersal. Our findings provide further evidence for the notion that theories to account for local rarity which are couched in terms of within‐community interactions alone are incomplete for the majority of species, because they need to account for different outcomes in different places.",,,Austral Ecology,,Wiley,"1442-9985, 1442-9993",,2004-05-26,2004,2004-05-26,2004-06,29,3,287-293,Closed,Article,"MURRAY, BRAD R.; LEPSCHI, BRENDAN J.","MURRAY, BRAD R.

Our objective was to examine the effect of vegetative habitat structure, in the presence or absence of a crayfish predator (Orconectes rusticus) and the herbicide atrazine, on Green Frog (Rana clamitans) tadpoles reared in 10-L microcosms in the laboratory. Crayfish predators reduced Green Frog survival and affected activity levels and microhabitat use differently depending on the presence or absence of vegetation. In treatments with vegetation, activity levels were greater when the crayfish predator was absent, but in treatments without vegetation activity levels did not differ between predation treatments. Moreover, when a crayfish predator was present, tadpoles in treatments without vegetation spent more time at the water surface than tadpoles in treatments with vegetation. This preference for the water surface may have been a compensatory behavioral change to avoid predation because it was less likely that crayfish would be able to reach the upper portion of the tank in the absence of vegetation. Atrazine exposure did not significantly influence susceptibility of Green Frog tadpoles to crayfish predators or alter the impact of vegetation. We found that vegetative habitat structure can mediate predatorprey interactions; however, contrary to previous studies we found that the presence of vegetation may benefit the crayfish predator and result in both lethal and sublethal effects on tadpole prey.","The authors are thankful for assistance in the field and laboratory from C.

The life history of the host can determine the relationship with its parasites. Reproductive effort and age of the host are two life history aspects often used to explain parasitic infection. In this study, we examined helminth parasite assemblages in two cyprinids with contrasting reproductive strategies, Cyprinella venusta (crevice spawners) and Notropis volucellus (broadcast spawners), in the Paluxy River (Texas) from May 2014 through October 2015. Host reproduction was measured using the gonadosomatic index, and standard length was used as an estimate of age. Parasite infection was measured using total number of helminths, parasite richness, Shannon’s diversity, and Simpson’s diversity. Our results revealed significant differences in parasite number and diversity between the two species, but not between males and females within species. Additionally, our results showed that standard length was a better predictor of parasitic infection than the gonadosomatic index. The relationship between host size and parasitic infection was expected; however, the lack of a relationship between gonadosomatic indices and parasitic infection was surprising. In conclusion, standard length was a better predictor of parasitic infection than the gonadosomatic index, and as such multiple species and life history traits should be considered when investigating host–parasite relationships.","We would like to thank Tarleton State University for making this research possible through their funding and support.

347,pub.1037864970,10.1016/j.baae.2015.04.002,,,,Hedgerow rejuvenation management affects invertebrate communities through changes to habitat structure,"Hedgerows are an important semi-natural habitat for invertebrates and other wildlife within agricultural landscapes. Hedgerow quality can be greatly affected either by over- or under-management. Neglect of hedgerows is an increasingly important issue as traditional management techniques such as hedgelaying become economically unviable. In the UK, funding for hedge management is available under agri-environment schemes but relatively little is known about how this impacts on wider biodiversity. We used a randomised block experiment to investigate how habitat structural change, arising from a range of techniques to rejuvenate hedgerows (including more economic/mechanised alternatives to traditional hedgelaying), affected invertebrate abundance and diversity. We combined digital image analysis with estimates of foliage biomass and quality to show which aspects of hedge structure were most affected by the rejuvenation treatments. All investigated aspects of habitat structure varied considerably with management type, though the abundance of herbivores and predators was affected primarily by foliage density. Detritivore abundance was most strongly correlated with variation in hedge gap size. The results suggest that habitat structure is an important organising force in invertebrate community interactions and that management technique may affect trophic groups differently. Specifically we find that alternative methods of hedgerow rejuvenation could support abundances of invertebrates comparable or even higher than traditional hedgelaying, with positive implications for the restoration of a larger area of hedgerow habitat on a limited budget.","The experimental setup was funded as part of DEFRA grant BD2114, with additional data collection for this study supported by NERC Centre for Ecology and Hydrology core funding.

However, the effect of thermal stratification on denitrifying bacterial community is still unclear. Here, we investigated the dynamics of nirS gene abundance and the structure and composition of nirS-type denitrifying bacterial community in a deep drinking water reservoir by quantitative PCR and high-throughput sequencing, respectively. The results showed that the abundance of nirS gene was approximately 105 copies/mL, and it was significantly higher in the metalimnion and hypolimnion than that of the epilimnion layer. Proteobacteria was the predominant phylum, with high abundance of the members of Burkholderiales and Rhodocyclales at order level. Twenty dominant genera were detected in the sequences analyzed among them five genera accounted for approximately 92% of classified sequences. The network analysis (NKA) showed that the co-existence and the interaction among the nirS-type denitrifying bacteria in the Jinpen Reservoir may be crucial for the regulation of the nitrogen-cycle and water quality. Structural equation model (SEM) illustrated that temperature and dissolved oxygen had great impact on the nirS-type denitrifying bacterial community during thermal stratification. Taking together, these results provide new evidence for the ecological distribution of nirS-type denitrifying bacterial community in reservoir ecosystem, reinforcing the recent findings on the linkages between the environmental factors and denitrifying bacterial community interactions in a deep drinking water reservoir during stratification.","We would like to express our deep thanks to Dr. Visser (University of Amsterdam, the Netherland) and Dr. Sekar (Xi’an Jiaotong-liverpool University, China) for providing insightful comments and suggestions while revising of this manuscript.

We hypothesized that variation in the environment and sex of a host plant, impact the composition and diversity of associated microbial communities. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the bacteriome of the non-vascular plant, Marchantia inflexa, in both males and females across multiple habitats by targeted sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. We describe the bacteriome for M. inflexa, and find that it is abundant and diverse, showing some similarities with other non-vascular plant lineages. Using these data, we detected a habitat specific component of the bacteriome, and sex differences in the bacteriome under common garden conditions. On the basis of known microbial functions, our analyses suggest that the specific taxonomic assemblages of bacteria detected in particular habitat types may serve functional roles; allowing plants to better acclimate to their local environment, and that sex differences in the bacteriome may correspond to subtle differences in the physiology and morphology of the sexes. Our initial characterization of variation in bacteriome composition of this tropical liverwort lineage provides valuable information for better understanding the patterns of plant-microbe interactions across land plants.","This project was funded by the University of Kentucky Biology Department’s Ribble Mini Grant program.

Most research on landscape factors has focused on one arthropod taxon or functional group, yet assessing how changes in urban landscape intensification and diversity affect several taxa across a region can inform biodiversity conservation and landscape management in times of biodiversity loss. We examined the influence of changes in urban landscape intensification and diversity across six spatial scales, from 200 m to 5 km, on the abundance and taxonomic richness of five arthropod groups in urban community gardens: ants, bees, ladybeetles, parasitoids, and spiders. We collected data over three years in 19 community gardens in the California central coast. We determined the influence of urban intensification (percent urban land-use cover) and landscape diversity (number and evenness of land-use types) on arthropod abundance and richness at each spatial scale in the context of local garden habitat. We found that all arthropod groups are influenced by landscape factors, but that landscape influence differed depending on spatial scale as well as local habitat features, likely due to arthropod community interactions and life history strategies. This study is an example of how patterns of arthropod biodiversity in urban gardens are driven by urbanization processes that shape the degree of landscape intensity and landscape diversity across spatial scales.","We thank the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems and the Environmental Studies Department at the University of California, Santa Cruz for supporting this research.

During the day, mysids in shallow Muriel Lake (≤45 m) were on or near the bottom; in Kennedy Lake (> 100 m), mysids remained deeper than 50 m. In both lakes, mysids spent summer nights at 0–15 m depths despite > 20 °C temperatures. Mysid density was not strongly correlated with lake depth. Mysids generally displayed spring to early summer minima and late summer to fall maxima in numbers and biomass. Single peaks in gravid females and juvenile mysid abundance, and the absence of pronounced seasonal size changes of gravid females suggest that N. mercedis produced a single generation each year. Fecundities of study lake mysids are the lowest on record, and although size-dependent, exhibited unusually high variability. Annual productivity of mysids averaged 485 mg m−2 y−1 (range 205–690). Calculations indicate mysids consume several times more zooplankton per annum than limnetic fish do. N. mercedis is likely an important competitor of juvenile sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) since: (i) sockeye exhibit food limited growth and survival patterns in coastal lakes, (ii) mysids and sockeye consume similar zooplankton prey and (iii) mysids do not contribute greatly to sockeye diet (i.e. < 26% of summer and fall diets by numbers or weight).",,,Hydrobiologia,,Springer Nature,"1037-0544, 1573-8590, 0018-8158, 1573-5117",,1992-02,1992,,1992-02,230,1,9-30,Closed,Article,"Cooper, Karen L.; Hyatt, Kim D.; Rankin, D.

We examined the contribution of three different habitat types (farmland, forest edge, forest understory) to bee diversity in a tropical forest-agriculture mosaic in Western Kenya and analysed differences and overlap in plant-bee community interactions between nearby habitats. We used network properties (network size and specialization indices) and bee species turnover to examine temporal and spatial variation of flower–visitation interaction networks in general and in bee species composition in detail across habitats. In total we found 121 bee and 89 plant species involved in the interactions. Results suggest that bees were limited by floral resources because the largest networks, highest diversity, and largest abundances were found at the forest edge and in the farmland which hosted higher amounts of flowers and a more homogeneous distribution of resources in space and time. Forest in the study area is characterized by (1) lower flower density and (2) more humid conditions relative to the farmland. We therefore suggest that the species-rich and structurally diverse farmland acts as a “pollinator rescue” which supports bee communities in the natural forest. We advise conservation managers and politicians to conserve the structural richness of the farmland to (1) preserve bee diversity within the farmland and (2) conserve positive effects of the farmland on bee activity in the forest remnant.","The authors thank the Kenya Wildlife Service and local farmers for their permission to work in Kakamega Forest and the surrounding farmland.

Microbes in a human, for example, account for 100 times more genes than their host; similar results are emerging for virtually all free-living organisms. Disease is the best studied host–microbe interaction, but endosymbiotic microbial populations and communities also are responsible for critical functions in their hosts including nutrient uptake (plants), reduction in inflammatory responses (animals), digestion (animals), anti-herbivore defenses (plants), and pathogen resistance. In spite of the tremendous diversity and functional importance of the microbial biome to free-living organisms, we have little predictive understanding of the biotic and abiotic factors controlling within-host microbial community composition or the spatial scales at which anthropogenic changes affect host and microbial community interactions and functions. Current research suggests that anthropogenic changes to nutrient supply and food web composition can affect biological systems at scales ranging from individuals to continents. However, while current studies are clarifying the effects of some of these drivers on the structure and functioning of ecosystems, we have far less knowledge of their effects on microbial communities residing within hosts.

Recently, the mechanistic basis of classic succession theory has been advanced by studies of plant and microbial interactions, functional traits, and retrogressive stages of ecosystem development. This special issue brings together a series of papers that highlight these contemporary novel approaches and how our understanding of ecological succession has advanced. Four key themes emerge from the issue: (a) generalizations about succession, (b) the influence of dispersal and habitat size on successional trajectories, (c) changes in plant functional traits during succession, and (d) belowground community interactions during long term during ecosystem development. Synthesis. The articles in the special issue highlight novel perspectives on succession theory, revealing the importance of historical contingency, disturbance severity, dispersal limitation, functional traits, and belowground community processes in determining patterns of ecosystem development. Together, they reinforce the importance of ecological succession in understanding the response of plant and microbial communities to disturbance in a changing world.

Recently, some empirical studies at large spatiotemporal scales suggest that increasing species richness within natural communities results in a finer division of biomass among species rather than an increase in total biomass. In parallel, the most common pattern observed in nature is the peaked relationship between diversity and productivity estimated as total biomass. Thus, the aim of our study is to provide model predictions for the diversity–biomass relationship with various levels of net species interactions within communities: negative, neutral, quasi‐neutral and positive. Using a scaling relationship between the number of species and total community biomass, we propose a new self‐similar process of biomass partitioning during a community assembly process. At each step of the succession, K more species appear that are A times less abundant on average giving K=Ad; the parameter d being a fractal dimension related to the nature of interactions among coexisting species. Our results, compared to those from meta‐analyses about empirical diversity–productivity relationships, illustrate that quasi‐neutral interactions among coexisting species lead to the most commonly observed pattern: an ‘envelope’ where diversity peaks at intermediate values of total biomass, i.e. that the area below the hump‐backed line (considered as the upper boundary) is filled with data points.",,,Oikos,,Wiley,"0030-1299, 1600-0706",,2006-06-06,2006,2006-06-06,2006-11,115,2,349-357,Closed,Article,"Mouillot, David; Mouquet, Nicolas","Mouillot, David (); Mouquet, Nicolas ()",,"Mouillot, David (); Mouquet, Nicolas ()",,,,,,,,,,,7,0,,0.53,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1042310373,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 41 Environmental Sciences,,,,,,B07 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,14 Life Below Water

The microbial co-occurrence network could shed a new understanding of microbial functioning as affected by land management. Current studies on microbial community interactions mainly considered surface soils, thus the understanding of the microbial interactions and functions in the subsoils is still limited. We investigated soil samples from undisturbed remnant forests and disturbed vineyards in top- (0–25 cm) and subsoils (40–100 cm) in the Hunter Valley region, New South Wales, Australia. Soil microbial communities of bacteria and fungi were characterized by analyses of 16S rRNA and ITS amplicon sequencing, respectively. Land use differences caused the variances of soil properties, as resulted in the differences of microbial community composition and diversity, especially for the topsoils. Moreover, we found that agriculture activities had influenced the microbial networks for both the top- and subsoils. Widely connected bacterial networks were found in forest soils but they appeared as highly centralized clusters in vineyards for both layers. Although the interactions within those network clusters were enhanced in cropping soils, the connections between the clusters decreased or even isolated. We also characterized bacterial functions for element cycling based on their putative functions. Agricultural disturbances decreased the variability of C cycling bacteria for both surface and below layers, and reduced bacteria abundances working for C cycling in the topsoils. Additionally, soil bacterial co-occurrence network clusters were found to be correlated with microbial functions for element cycling, which demonstrated the significant influences of microbial network structure for microbial biological functions.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

However, high replacement levels cause negative impacts on carnivore salmonids' growth, partly explained by alterations in the inflammatory and antioxidant response. To cope with this situation, we evaluated the effect of a dietary polyphenol supplementation of micro-encapsulated grape pomace extract (MGPE) from wine industry residual by-product in a diet high in soybean meal on growth performance, plasma antioxidant capacity, and gut microbial communities of Oncorhynchus mykiss for 30, 60 and 90 days. For this purpose, we first compared two commercial diets with low and high soybean meal (SBM) content without MGPE, and as expected, the high soybean content diet showed a significant decrease in the antioxidant capacity and the growth performance of the fish. Interestingly, this phenomenon was reverted in fish fed with the high SBM diet supplemented with the MGPE. Complementary, a fish gut microbiome analysis showed a time-dependent drop in microbial richness and diet-dependent changes in the bacterial communities from 60 days of treatment.

339,pub.1027241099,10.1093/plankt/23.8.779,,,,Seasonal variations in the morphology of the coccolithophore Calcidiscus leptoporus off Bermuda (N. Atlantic),"Calcidiscus leptoporus is a cosmopolitan coccolithophore species with one of the longest fossil records. A previous morphometric study on coccoliths of C. leptoporus, carried out on a global set of Holocene sediment samples, indicated that temperature might be a significant factor influencing the size distribution of C. leptoporus. In the present study, C. leptoporus morphological variations and dynamics are studied in samples from Hydrostation S time series, near Bermuda, over a 3 year interval (1991 to 1994) with monthly sampling. Calcidiscus leptoporus was present all year round in very low abundances but displayed strong variations through the time-series, both in absolute abundances (maximum 551 cells/l and minimum <10 cells/l) and in morphology. No significant correlation between environmental parameters and C. leptoporus abundances was found. The seasonal dynamics of C. leptoporus, therefore, appears to be the consequence of plankton community interactions and, possibly, of life-cyle. The morphological study of C. leptoporus shows a sharp decrease in size and variability occurring during the spring–summer transition at the onset of water stratification. Our results give no conclusive evidence as to whether C. leptoporus at Hydrostation S consists of an assemblage of different species or ecophenotypes. However, we provide evidence for significant morphological plasticity linked to seasonality and possibly temperature. More importantly, our results show a trend between temperature and morphology opposite to the study of Knappertsbusch et al. (Knappertsbusch et al., 1997) based on Holocene sediments.

338,pub.1047116916,10.1111/rec.12346,,,,Leveraging nature's backup plans to incorporate interspecific interactions and resilience into restoration,"Interspecific interactions are important structuring forces in ecological communities. Interactions can be disturbed when species are lost from a community. When interactions result in fitness gains for at least one participating organism, that organism may experience reduced fitness as a result of interaction disturbance. However, many species exhibit traits that enable individuals to persist and reproduce in spite of such disruptions, resulting in resilience to interaction disturbance. Such traits can result in interaction generalization, phenotypic and behavioral plasticity, and adaptive capacity. We discuss examples of these traits and use case studies to illustrate how restoration practitioners can use a trait‐based approach to examine species of concern, identify traits that are associated with interspecific interactions and are relevant to resilience, and target such traits in restoration. Restoration activities that bolster interaction resilience could include, for example, reintroducing or supporting specific functional groups or managing abiotic conditions to reduce interaction dependence by at‐risk species (e.g. providing structural complexity offering shelter and cover). Resilience may also be an important consideration in species selection for restoration. Establishment of resilient species, able to persist after interaction disturbance, may be essential to restoring to a functioning ecological community. Once such species are present, they could help support more specialized species that lack resilience traits, such as many species of concern. Understanding the conditions under which processes linked to resilience may enable species to persist and communities to reform following interaction disturbance is a key application of community ecology to ecological restoration.",,,Restoration Ecology,,Wiley,"1061-2971, 1526-100X",,2016-02-16,2016,2016-02-16,2016-07,24,4,434-440,Closed,Article,"Aslan, Clare E.; Bronstein, Judith L.; Rogers, Haldre S.; Gedan, Keryn B.; Brodie, Jedediah; Palmer, Todd M.; Young, Truman P.","Aslan, Clare E.

338,pub.1145407055,10.1093/jmammal/gyac026,,,,Predator niche overlap and partitioning and potential interactions in the mountains of Central Asia,"Abstract Direct and indirect interactions among predators affect predator fitness, distribution, and overall community structure. Yet, outside of experimental settings, such interactions are difficult to observe and thus poorly understood. Patterns of niche overlap among predators reflect and shape community interactions and may therefore help elucidate the nature and intensity of intraguild interactions. To better understand the coexistence of two apex predators, snow leopards (Panthera uncia) and wolves (Canis lupus), we investigated their spatial, temporal, and dietary niche overlap in summer in the Pamir Mountains of Tajikistan. We estimated population-level space use via spatial capture–recapture models based on noninvasive genetics and camera traps, diel activity patterns based on camera trap detections, and diet composition from prey remains in carnivore scats, from which we estimated coefficients between 0 and 1 for overlap in space, time, and diet, respectively. Snow leopards and wolves displayed moderate spatial partitioning (0.26, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17–37), but overlapping temporal (0.77, 95% CI: 0.64–0.90) and dietary (0.97, 95% CI: 0.80–0.99) niches. Both predators relied on seasonally abundant marmots (Marmota caudata) rather than wild ungulates, their typical primary prey, suggesting that despite patterns of overlap that were superficially conducive to exploitation competition and predator facilitation, prey were likely not a limiting factor. Therefore, prey-mediated interactions, if present, were unlikely to be a major structuring force in the ecosystem. By implication, carnivore conservation planning and monitoring in the mountains of Central Asia should more fully account for the seasonal importance of marmots in the ecosystem.","We are grateful to the staff and communities of the Zorkul State Protected Area, and the expertise shared by the Natural History Museum of Vienna and the Academy of Sciences of Tajikistan.

                    As use and emission of metal-based engineered nanomaterials (MENM) is steadily increasing, concern of adverse effects on soil communities is rising. MENM are not only toxic to various organisms in soil, but can bioaccumulate, trophically transfer and even biomagnify in some systems. Negative effects of MENM on plant-fungi and plant-bacteria interactions have been shown in various studies, while further research on other forms of interactions (
                    e.g.
                    competition, predation) is needed to assess potential risks. Negative effects of MENM on nitrogen turnover and increased carbon emissions have been shown in numerous studies, and other biogeochemical cycles potentially at risk are addressed here. Most data to date has been collected on the consequences of MENM exposure for microorganisms and particle dependent changes in their community composition have been shown; data on other organism communities is however not available. In this review we summarize community interactions and soil ecosystem processes affected by MENM exposure and show how soil organisms influence MENM properties. Based on short- and long-term toxic effects, multiple inter- and intraspecific interactions and chemical processes we develop a conceptual framework. We postulate that cascading and potentially catalytic effects of MENM in soil might explain toxic effects at low concentration after longer exposure. Therefore, risk assessment of MENM relying solely on acute single species tests might be insufficient, and major research efforts are still needed in the area of soil communities and MENM exposure.",We thank Stephan Hackmann for helpful comments on an earlier version of the manuscript.,,Environmental Science Nano,,Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC),"2051-8153, 2051-8161",,2016,2016,2016,2016,3,3,506-533,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"McKee, Moira S.; Filser, Juliane","McKee, Moira S.

338,pub.1092150355,10.1002/lno.10675,,,,"Patterns and drivers of δ13C variation in the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera","The giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera is a major primary producer and supports species‐rich and productive marine communities on temperate coastlines. The δ13C signature of M. pyrifera tissue is an important potential tool for understanding species interactions within nearshore trophic networks. However, in macroalgae, δ13C can vary widely, and M. pyrifera can differ up to 6‰ within a single individual, greatly complicating the designation of a primary end member in isotope mixing models. Abiotic factors such as irradiance, dissolved inorganic carbon concentration, water motion, and water temperature can drive δ13C variation, either by altering the supply of total CO2 available to individual tissues, or by inducing facultative carbon concentrating mechanisms. In this study, we combine a controlled laboratory experiment with field sampling to better understand and predict the abiotic drivers of δ13C signatures in M. pyrifera tissues. In the field, data revealed strong correlations between δ13C signatures and depth, as well as season and location within a kelp bed. Experimental data demonstrated that the δ13C of incubated tissue was strongly driven by irradiance but not flow velocity, suggesting that enrichment in M. pyrifera tissue is the result of a light‐induced metabolic process. We also confirmed a physiological δ13C enrichment process associated with photosynthate transport. These results facilitate understanding and prediction of the variation in δ13C observed in the field, and inform interpretations of δ13C signatures in trophic analyses and community interaction studies.","Acknowledgments The authors thank Nuria Marba and four anonymous reviewers, who significantly improved the quality of this manuscript.

There is strong evidence for an increase in facilitation between native plant species with increasing levels of natural environmental stress, however it is unknown whether these same positive interactions occur between nonnative invaders and native communities. I investigated the effects of natural stress on community interactions between native heathland species and nonnative species with two field studies conducted at the landscape and community scale. At the landscape scale of investigation, nonnative species richness was positively related to native species richness. At the community level, nonnative invaders experienced facilitation with natives in the most stressful zones, whereas they experienced competition with native plants in the less stressful zones of the heathlands. Due to the observational nature of the landscape scale data, it is unclear whether nonnative diversity levels are responding positively to extrinsic factors or to native biodiversity. The experimental component of this research suggests that native community members may ameliorate stressful environmental conditions and facilitate invasion into high stress areas. I present a conceptual model which is a modification of the Shea and Chesson diversity-invasibility model and includes both facilitation as well as competition between the native community and nonnative invaders at the community level, summing to an overall positive relationship at the landscape scale.","Financial support was provided by the National Parks Ecological Research Fellowship (A program funded by the National Park Foundation through a generous grant from the A.

Kleptoparasitism (the stealing of procured food) by dominant scavengers can have negative effects on populations and behaviors of apex predators. We captured 7 pumas (Puma concolor) and fitted them with GPS collars to investigate potential kill sites (n = 352), some of which we monitored with camera traps (n = 58). We analyzed whether observed kleptoparasitism by American black bears (Ursus americanus) affected puma energetics and foraging behavior. We found that black bears were the most frequent scavenger of puma kills (72.4%), and we documented bears scavenging puma kills during every month. The top model for bear detection of puma kills included prey size, temperature, and canopy cover, with bears more likely to scavenge from adult black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) carcasses in warmer temperatures and under dense canopy cover. When black bear scavenging occurred, pumas spent 22% less time at their kill and incurred energetic losses. In response, pumas shortened their inter-kill intervals by 1.3 days thus increasing their kill rates. Our results demonstrate how a dominant scavenger directly mediates the foraging behavior of an apex predator. These results suggest that community interactions do not necessarily start at the top in top-down systems, and the effects of predators on prey populations can only be understood within their respective ecological communities.","The California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the University of California at Davis, and the California Deer Association generously provided funding for the project.

The objective of this study was to establish a baseline of fish community structure (species composition, incidence and relative abundance) in relation to salinity, pH and temperature gradients in an Arctic estuary, the Husky Lakes, Canada. Sampling involved an early-summer, standardized, experimental netting survey around the entire perimeter of all estuary basins and peninsulas. Detrended canonical correspondence analysis (DCCA) was used to evaluate species–environment associations. The ecosystem sustains an abundant and diverse fish community, characterized by co-dominance of coregonids and a marine schooling fish, Clupea pallasii, and high abundance of freshwater/freshwater-amphidromous species in the innermost basins. Highest richness and total abundance were related to mixing conditions, warmest temperatures, connectivity to nearby ecosystems, and diversity in species life histories. Salinity determined spatial patterns of fish species abundance and distribution. The incidence of freshwater fish was limited by the availability of low salinity habitat and potential community interactions. These fish, particularly Salvelinus namaycush and Thymallus arcticus, are considered as the most vulnerable to changes in freshwater habitat availability. The fish assemblage reflects environmental information from surrounding fluvial, freshwater, coastal marine and catchment ecosystems, and is thus a prime candidate for monitoring environmental change in the region. The results provide a benchmark against which future studies of fish communities can be compared to evaluate potential effects of climate change and anthropogenic development on fish populations from Husky Lakes and similar Arctic aquatic ecosystems.","Fieldwork was conducted with the able assistance of Todd Slack, and community technicians including Joseph Felix Jr., Freddie Gruben, Douglas Panaktalok, Joseph Illasiak Jr., Kyle Kisoun, Clarence Mangelana, and Forrest Day.

We examined the competitive interactions among seven species in all pairwise combinations in a greenhouse experiment. Competitive effect and response were measured as the relative yield (RY) for each target-neighbor species combination for both seedling and adult plants. Competitive hierarchies were constructed based on competitive effect and response scores, and we examined the degree of transitivity in the seedling and adult competitive hierarchies. The competitive effect hierarchy did not vary substantially with plant age, while the competitive response hierarchy was highly variable between juvenile and adult plants. Competitive effect and response ability were positively correlated at both plant stages. The seedling relative yield matrix was predominantly transitive, while there were far fewer transitive competitive relationships among the adult plants. The breakdown of the clear competitive hierarchy among seedlings as plants aged may explain why competition does not appear to be an active mechanism structuring some late-successional plant communities. In early-successional communities, interactions among seedlings with a clear competitive hierarchy may establish competitive ability—abundance relationships that persist as a legacy effect even though the breakdown of the competitive hierarchy among adult plants removes competition as an active mechanism structuring some late-successional plant communities.",This research was financially supported by a fellowship from the China Scholarship Council (CSC) to SZ and grants from the Beef Cattle Research Council (BCRC) and the National Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) to EGL.

In reef-building systems, substrate is collectively engineered by individuals that also occupy it and compete for space. Reefs are constrained spatially by the physical environment, and by mortality, which reduces production but exposes substrate for recruits. Reef self-organization therefore depends on efficient balancing of production and occupancy of substrate. To examine this, we develop a three-dimensional individual-based model (IBM) of oyster reef mechanics. Shell substrate is grown by individuals as valves, accumulates at the reef level, and degrades following mortality. Single restoration events and subsequent dynamics are simulated for a case study in South Carolina (USA). Variability in model processes is included on recruitment, spatial environmental constraints, and predation, over multiple independent runs and five predator community scenarios. The main goal for this study is to summarize trends in dynamics that are robust across this uncertainty, and from these generate new hypotheses and predictions for future studies. Simulation results demonstrate three phases following restoration: initial transient dynamics with considerable shell loss, followed by growth and saturation of the live population, and then saturation of settlement habitat several years later. Over half of simulations recoup initial shell losses as populations grow, while others continue in decline. The balance between population density, substrate supporting the reef, and exposed surfaces for settlement is mediated by overall population size and size structure, presence of predators, and relative amounts of live individuals and intact dead shells. The efficiency of settlement substrate production improves through time as population size structure becomes more complex, and the population of dead valves accumulates.","We thank Donald Schoolmaster, Jr. and six anonymous reviewers for generously donating their time to review this publication.

Some parasites are particularly impactful, causing significant reproductive and behavioral changes in hosts relative to uninfected conspecifics. In eastern North America, a non-native parasitic barnacle, Loxothylacus panopaei (Gissler, 1884), has severe reproductive impacts on native panopeid mud crab hosts, resulting in castration. Moreover, the parasite has been documented to induce significant behavioral changes, such as reducing mud crab activity, influencing predator-prey relationships, and enhancing hiding behaviors in infected host crabs. Yet much remains to be understood regarding the host's ability to escape predators in heterogeneous environments. We investigated the effects of L. panopaei parasitism on mud crab (flatback mud crab, Eurypanopeus depressus (Smith, 1869)) survival in simple versus complex habitats. In lab mesocosm experiments, habitat heterogeneity was manipulated using oysters and gravel, and predatory pressures came from two common predatory crabs in southeast Atlantic estuaries: the Atlantic mud crab, Panopeus herbstii (H. Milne Edwards 1884) and the stone crab, Menippe mercenaria (Say, 1818). We found L. panopaei-infected E. depressus crabs to have the lowest survival rates in the simple gravel habitat, while the crabs with the highest survival were uninfected crabs in the complex oyster habitat. Moreover, we detected differences between uninfected and infected crabs in habitat usage (oyster versus gravel) within the complex habitat. This study demonstrates the complexity of predator-prey dynamics in the face of impactful parasitism and global change, including the introductions of species to new communities where they may have strong impacts on host populations and community interactions.","This manuscript was based on CAB&#x27;s honors thesis work at East Carolina University (ECU).

331,pub.1113988071,10.1643/ch-18-140,,,,Macroinvertebrate Foraging on Larval Ambystoma maculatum across Ontogeny,"Understanding community interactions, such as predatorprey dynamics, is vital for determining species viability. Outside of larger macroinvertebrate predators, such as crayfish and dragonfly larvae, there is a paucity of information regarding the effectiveness of other macroinvertebrate predators in consuming larval amphibians, especially caudate larvae, during aquatic life-stages within pond communities. In this study, we tested the ability of a suite of macroinvertebrate predators to consume Spotted Salamander larvae (Ambystoma maculatum) at two points during larval development. We tested the ability of macroinvertebrate predators belonging to the genera Belostoma, Lestes, Notonecta, and Ranatra, the families Aeshnidae, Dytiscidae, Gomphidae, Gyrinidae, Hirudinae, Libellulidae, and Notonectidae, or order Trichoptera, as well as larvae of Rana clamitans, to consume A. maculatum immediately after hatching and several weeks into their larval period across four separate experiments. We tested for significant differences in percent survival of A. maculatum among predator treatments using ANOVA. Across all trials, we found a significant effect of predator treatment. Both hatchling and larval A. maculatum were susceptible to predation by Aeshnidae and Notonectidae. In all other treatments, we observed low or zero mortality of hatchlings of A. maculatum and 100% survival of larvae of A. maculatum. As Aeshnidae and Notonectidae are both gape unconstrained predators, the increase in larval size did not appear to increase survival of A. maculatum due to increased escape performance. Overall, rates of predation are low for A. maculatum for most macroinvertebrates during the tested life stages, suggesting that predation by only a handful of invertebrate taxa and vertebrates contribute to high mortality rates within this system.","We thank L.

The importance of the refugial debate is certain to increase in response to observed and expected species extinctions caused by climate change. Small areas where species survive outside their core range are important, as unique natural phenomena and model systems for observing the response of species to climate change. They can play a crucial role as potential sources for species recovery in the future or can act as progenitors of a new species. While most authors believe that sites connected with only long-term isolation should be included into the refugium concept, this approach can result in the loss of linkage between the ecological and evolutionary processes taking place during different phases of the species range dynamics. Moreover, the papers often interpret the nature of described phenomena in different ways. In response, the conceptual scheme given in our letter summarises the patterns which occur during species range shift. It proposes an equivalent scheme for small refugial sites according to their function and capacity, based on the relict species concept. This approach and proposed terminology is tested on the example of two plant species with different pattern of the long term range dynamics. Our paper highlights the importance of sites harboring ‘trailing-edge’ young relicts for the future long-term persistence of the species (as old relicts) under unfavorable regional conditions. By considering the age gradients of small refugial sites it is possible to reveal community interactions, species traits or genes that drive the responses of biota to climate changes.",Our generalized model and theoretical conception are the result of the experience gained during research financially supported by the University of Łódź.,,Evolutionary Ecology,,Springer Nature,"0269-7653, 1573-8477",,2017-07-20,2017,2017-07-20,2017-12,31,6,815-827,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Kiedrzyński, Marcin; Zielińska, Katarzyna M.; Kiedrzyńska, Edyta; Rewicz, Agnieszka","Kiedrzyński, Marcin (Department of Geobotany and Plant Ecology, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland); Zielińska, Katarzyna M.

Fouling epifauna are generally believed to reduce the settlement of interspecific larvae through competitive exclusion and predation. Studies of these interactions, however, often utilize artificial settlement panels, which can exhibit different recruitment patterns to those observed on natural substrates.Native (Crassostrea virginica) and non-native (Crassostrea ariakensis) oyster larvae were exposed to reef-collected shells, each supporting a single species of reef-associated fauna, over a series of laboratory microcosm studies. The presence of adult bryozoans (Membranipora tenuis) had little effect on rates of larval settlement or mortality. The boring sponge (Cliona sp.) significantly decreased oyster larval settlement, and generally increased oyster mortality. Barnacles (Balanus improvisus) typically facilitated settlement. Barnacle molds and empty barnacle tests, intended to mimic the surface area and rugosity of live barnacles, did not significantly affect settlement. In some trials, adult barnacle bathwater enhanced settlement of oyster larvae, highlighting the importance of waterborne cues. Barnacle bathwaters, adult clam worm (Neanthes succinea) bathwaters and bathwaters created using adult oysters were all found to cause oyster larval mortality. Predation by clam worms, which were observed at very high densities on field-collected oyster shells, caused significant oyster larval mortality in these experiments.The combined effects of positive and negative interactions between oyster larvae and resident invertebrate reef fauna require enumeration under field conditions. The results from this study highlight the need for a more thorough understanding of settlement behavior and mortality sources of recruiting oyster larvae.","The authors would like to thank all reviewers for improvements to this manuscript.

Changes to the microbial community in this region could affect the way nutrients are cycled, impact the efficiency of carbon drawdown, and cause shifts in food supply to higher trophic levels. Increased CO2 could affect the bioavailability of iron to phytoplankton. Fertilisation experiments show that iron can influence phytoplankton community composition, favouring large phytoplankton species in iron-replete conditions. The potential interactive effects of CO2 and iron bioavailability are currently poorly understood but are likely to be important in determining CO2-induced changes to the microbial community. We employ a qualitative network modelling approach to evaluate alternative hypotheses regarding the effects of elevated CO2 on Antarctic microbial communities in incubation experiments. We used a sequential approach to model development and testing, where we first formulated a base model for microbial community interactions, and then sequentially added direct and indirect effects of elevated CO2 on particular groups. We found that model simulations were most consistent with observations from incubation experiments when we assumed an indirect effect of CO2 on phytoplankton. In particular, when we assumed a negative effect of elevated CO2 on the uptake of iron by large phytoplankton, as a result of a decrease in iron bioavailability. Our findings show that qualitative network models can be used to test hypotheses relating to results from experimental studies, and help identify key processes to target in future studies.",The authors would like to thank the two anonymous reviewers for providing valuable comments and suggestions.

331,pub.1026331061,10.1111/oik.01704,,,,Multiple environmental changes interact to modify species dynamics and invasion rates,"Multiple aspects of the environment often change at the same time, influencing populations directly by modifying their physiology, but also indirectly by influencing other interacting species. The impacts of each environmental change upon population dynamics are usually assumed be independent of the state of other aspects of the environment, despite evidence at the individual level indicating that the combined impacts are often non‐additive. The importance of indirect effects mediated through community interactions also has high uncertainty. We used experimental microcosms to determine whether environmental factors interact to affect species dynamics and the relative importance of direct and indirect effects on species dynamics. We factorially manipulated three aspects of the environment (temperature, food availability and salinity) and examined reciprocal invasions of competing protist species under each environment. Experimental observations were used to parameterize a dynamic model of the system. Using this model and a novel variance decomposition method, we examined the mechanisms by which environmental changes altered species invasion rates. The three environmental factors interacted when modifying species growth rates, intra‐ and interspecific competition, causing the impact of each environmental change on species dynamics to depend crucially on the state of other aspects of the environment. Indirect changes in the abundance of the resident competitor and its interspecific competitive ability were the main cause of environmental driven variation in invasion rates, whilst direct effects on species intrinsic growth rates were relatively unimportant. This indicates that, to understand and ultimately predict species and community responses to multiple environmental changes, we should consider their joint impacts and the mechanisms by which they interact to modify key ecological processes such as competition.",This research was funded by a Natural Environment Research Council PhD Studentship.

These diverse microorganisms interact with each other and the host to form a complex microbiome community. A growing body of research suggests that the microbiome has a significant impact on plant yield or health by promoting growth, stress tolerance, and resistance to pathogens. Although plant microbiomes have great potential for improving plant health and productivity, studies on crop microbiomes, especially in corn, have only recently started to be conducted. During the last few years, progress in next-generation sequencing technologies has enabled an increasing number of studies of corn-associated microbiomes and their dynamics with the plant. The composition and differentiation of microbial communities are affected not only by environmental factors and agricultural management but also by host phenotype and genotype. Although challenges remain in understanding the microbiome, the combination of beneficial plant microbes, microbial community interactions, and the optimization of the taxonomic composition of microbiomes determine the overall health and fitness of the plant and thus lead to more sustainable agriculture. In this review, we present an overview of the current knowledge and research on corn microbiomes using traditional culture-based approaches and next-generation amplicon or metagenomic profiling, discuss results from these approaches with an emphasis on the influence of environmental and host genetic factors on corn-microbe interactions, and outline future directions and challenges in corn microbiome research. A better understanding of the corn microbiome diversity, function, and microbiology will contribute to the improvement of crop health and productivity.

In Brassica napus, our current understanding of root growth dynamics and dominance of bacterial taxa and their dynamics across growth stages is insufficient. In addition, the association of root traits with dominant and potential growth promoting bacteria across growth stages under field conditions has not been well studied.Methods:Here, we use temporally intensive weekly sampling of B. napus over a ten-week period to characterize root growth dynamics, dominant rhizosphere bacterial taxa, and association between the two. We characterized the rhizosphere bacteria using high throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes.Results:B. napus root length showed distinct growth stage patterns with an increase in root length at early stages followed by s  and/or gradual increase at flowering followed by reduction at maturity. Fine root length at the two-three leaf stage and seed yield were significantly positively correlated. The dominant microbial community composition was positively correlated with root traits and environmental variables, with the strongest correlation at the vegetative stage. Positive and significant correlations between individual bacterial genera and root traits were observed during vegetative stage, suggesting possible causal linkage between the two.ConclusionsThe observed significant positive correlations between the bacterial genera and root traits and between root length and seed yield under field conditions suggest the potential for designing root development and beneficial microbial interaction-based canola breeding and management strategies.",,"This study was funded by the Canada First Research Excellence Fund under the Plant Phenotyping and Imaging Research Centre (P2IRC) project 1.3, Plant Pedological Phenotype: Phenotyping the Plant Microbiome at the University of Saskatchewan, and a Saskatchewan Wheat Development Commission Scholarship to ZT.",Plant and Soil,,Springer Nature,"0032-079X, 1573-5036",,2022-01-06,2022,2022-01-06,2022-04,473,1-2,441-456,Closed,Article,"Taye, Zelalem M.; Noble, Kalli; Siciliano, Steven D.; Helgason, Bobbi L.; Lamb, Eric G.","Taye, Zelalem M.

In case of the willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus in Fennoscandia, ungulate overbrowsing of willows has been hypothesized to exert such negative habitat-related impacts. Moreover, a steep population decline of willow ptarmigan in southern Fennoscandia has recently been attributed to community interactions linking the fate of the willow ptarmigan to a change in keystone tundra rodent populations. Community and habitat factors may also interact in their impact on willow ptarmigan abundance. Here we assess whether willow thicket structural characteristics sensitive to ungulate browsing impacted willow ptarmigan habitat occupancy and whether such impacts depended on small rodent population dynamics. We employed an extensive survey approach spatially encompassing three riparian tundra regions and covering the phases of increase, peak and crash of the small rodent cycle. Willow ptarmigan habitat occupancy increased with the areal extent of willow thickets, whereas it decreased with increasing degree of thicket fragmentation (i.e. habitat shredding). Both of these effects were consistent with ungulate over-browsing impacting willow ptarmigan abundance negatively. Over the 4-year study period, willow ptarmigan habitat occupancy declined steeply independently of spatial variation in willow thicket areal extent and fragmentation. Moreover, the expected increase in ptarmigan populations during the increase/peak phase of the rodent cycle was not observed. Thus although our study provides support for the hypothesis that intense ungulate browsing negatively impacts willow ptarmigan, our study also suggests that causes of the current steep decline of ptarmigan populations in northern Fennoscandia should be sought in factors other than habitat fragmentation and changed rodent population dynamics.","We are grateful to Knut Langeland for assistance on classification of willow thickets from aerial photographs, Raymond Sørensen and Phillip D.

Although studied extensively as a model organism in evolutionary biology, behavioral ecology, genomics, and numerous related subfields, this research relies heavily on populations from the Pacific coastal regions of North America and Asia, and those of northern Europe. However, based on the morphology of some western Atlantic populations, the different ecological context, and the evolutionary history of the species, not all of the knowledge gained from Pacific and European lineages is likely to be fully transferrable to the populations of North America’s East Coast. Nevertheless, work in eastern Canada does suggest high levels of intraspecific phenotypic diversity and local adaptation, though much of this diversity may be under threat from climate change, altered land use patterns, and introduced species. These factors warrant a research program focused on broad sampling of previously identified populations, identifying previously undocumented populations, determining whether there are unique genetic mechanisms underlying the unusual trait combinations present in the region, and exploring novel community interactions. Such a research program would facilitate future studies in ecology, conservation, and evolution by documenting phenotypic changes and establish baselines for future work. Because the work on nearshore marine threespine stickleback populations is sparse in the western Atlantic, I focus here on freshwater populations—with the exception of a brief discussion of the “white” stickleback populations of Nova Scotia—but this is not to suggest that nearshore marine populations are not phenotypically diverse.","Many thanks to Andrew Hendry for his comments on this manuscript and his encouragement to expand it from a brief white paper to a review and submit it to this special issue commemorating David Noakes.

This research tested how seawater pCO2 may interact with seasonal light availability to affect the photosynthesis and calcification of high-latitude coralline algae, and whether the responses of these calcified macroalgae are modified by physical association with a non-calcified seaweed. Through an in situ approach, our study first investigated how current seasonal environmental variation affects the growth of the understory coralline algae Crusticorallina spp. and Bossiella orbigniana in Southeast Alaska's kelp forests. We then experimentally manipulated pH to simulate end-of-century acidification scenarios, light regime to simulate seasonal light availability at the benthos, and pairings of coralline algal species with and without a fleshy red alga to examine the interactive effects of these variables on coralline productivity and calcification. Our results indicate that: 1) coralline species may face net dissolution under projected future winter pH and carbonate saturation state conditions, 2) differences in seasonal light availability in productive, high-latitude waters may not be distinct enough to modify coralline algal net calcification, and 3) association with a non-calcified red alga does not alter the response of these coralline algal species to ocean acidification scenarios. This research highlights the necessity of incorporating locally informed scenarios of environmental variability and community interactions when predicting species’ vulnerability to global change.","We thank C.

330,pub.1086111791,10.1111/jbi.13045,,,,Global patterns of interaction specialization in bird–flower networks,"Among the world's three major nectar‐feeding bird taxa, hummingbirds are the most phenotypically specialized for nectarivory, followed by sunbirds, while the honeyeaters are the least phenotypically specialized taxa. We tested whether this phenotypic specialization gradient is also found in the interaction patterns with their floral resources. Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania/Australia. We compiled interaction networks between birds and floral resources for 79 hummingbird, nine sunbird and 33 honeyeater communities. Interaction specialization was quantified through connectance (C), complementary specialization (H2′), binary (QB) and weighted modularity (Q), with both observed and null‐model corrected values. We compared interaction specialization among the three types of bird–flower communities, both independently and while controlling for potential confounding variables, such as plant species richness, asymmetry, latitude, insularity, topography, sampling methods and intensity. Hummingbird–flower networks were more specialized than honeyeater–flower networks. Specifically, hummingbird–flower networks had a lower proportion of realized interactions (lower C), decreased niche overlap (greater H2′) and greater modularity (greater QB). However, we found no significant differences between hummingbird– and sunbird–flower networks, nor between sunbird– and honeyeater–flower networks. As expected, hummingbirds and their floral resources have greater interaction specialization than honeyeaters, possibly because of greater phenotypic specialization and greater floral resource richness in the New World. Interaction specialization in sunbird–flower communities was similar to both hummingbird–flower and honeyeater–flower communities. This may either be due to the relatively small number of sunbird–flower networks available, or because sunbird–flower communities share features of both hummingbird–flower communities (specialized floral shapes) and honeyeater–flower communities (fewer floral resources). These results suggest a link between interaction specialization and both phenotypic specialization and floral resource richness within bird–flower communities at a global scale.","We thank Marco A.

330,pub.1090372800,10.1002/ecs2.1830,,,,The cyanobacterium Gloeotrichia echinulata increases the stability and network complexity of phytoplankton communities,"Changes in the abundance of a taxon can have large effects on communities, particularly if that taxon is a strong interactor. These changes may arise as a consequence of environmental change, recruitment from dormant stages, or quirks of population dynamics, and have effects that ripple through a community interaction network. We hypothesized that cyanobacteria, which are increasing in many freshwater lakes globally, may be strong interactors because they can exert large and persistent effects on the biomass and composition of other phytoplankton. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated how the phytoplankton community responded to different densities of Gloeotrichia echinulata, a large colonial cyanobacterium increasingly observed in low‐nutrient lakes in northeastern North America, in an in situ mesocosm experiment. We observed that many phytoplankton taxa, especially diatoms and green algae, responded primarily to increased nutrient availability (a result of Gloeotrichia's nitrogen fixation and translocation of phosphorus from the sediments), while a few taxa (two euglenophytes, one dinoflagellate, and one cyanobacterium) responded to both the direct and indirect effects of Gloeotrichia. Surprisingly, Gloeotrichia reduced the compositional variability of the phytoplankton community relative to the non‐Gloeotrichia control treatment; there was no effect on the aggregate temporal variability of total non‐Gloeotrichia biovolume. Moreover, experimentally increased densities of Gloeotrichia coincided with increasing complexity of the phytoplankton community in network analyses of taxon co‐occurrences, as indicated by significantly greater network density and transitivity and shorter path lengths. Taken together, these findings suggest that Gloeotrichia may be a strongly interacting species in low‐nutrient lakes, with the potential to increase the resilience of phytoplankton communities to future disturbance by increasing compositional stability and network complexity.","We thank Jennie Brentrup, Stacy Davis, and Quinn Thomas for field and laboratory assistance and the Lake Sunapee Protective Association, Montgomery and Eliassen families, Robert Wood, and June Fichter for field site access.

330,pub.1053289947,10.1016/j.baae.2009.03.006,,,,Water limitation prevails over energy in European diversity gradients of sheetweb spiders (Araneae: Linyphiidae),"Across large spatial scales, species richness in many taxa is mainly determined by climatic variables. However, some of the mechanisms behind large-scale patterns of species richness and abundance are expected to act on the community level, and on a smaller scale than the resolution of the data commonly used for deriving these patterns. We studied the distribution of sheetweb spiders (Araneae: Linyphiidae) across Europe using both standardised samples from local habitats and large-scale inventories. In the first approach, we analysed species and individual numbers from standardised pitfall traps from 17 locations distributed from northern Sweden to Spain and Greece. We also calculated Simpson indices to correct for different activity densities. Additionally, we analysed whether diversity of sheetweb spiders is sensitive to habitat type. In the second approach, we investigated the known sheetweb spider species richness of European countries and large islands. In both datasets, species richness of sheetweb spiders reached a maximum at about 55°N and declined towards the Mediterranean and the Arctic. In addition, species richness decreased from western (maritime) to eastern (continental) regions. Also Simpson diversity showed a hump-shaped relation to latitude, and was the only variable influenced by habitat type. In contrast to species richness and diversity, activity density increased monotonously with latitude. Towards the north, sheetweb spiders are likely limited by energy availability, towards the south, water limitation as well as bottom-up and top-down community interactions may reduce sheetweb spiders. Accordingly, their diversity does not follow the pattern of vertebrates, large insects and aquatic organisms, which depend more strongly on energy availability.",Special thanks to Monica Wyss-Lopez for logistic support and sharing of climate data and all field workers for operating traps.

330,pub.1052607926,10.1016/j.biocon.2014.09.011,,,,Effects of habitat alteration on lizard community and food web structure in a desert steppe ecosystem,"Habitat alteration has major impacts on biodiversity, but we do not fully understand how changes in vegetation structure alter community interactions among vertebrate predators and their prey. Desertification is a major threat to degraded steppe habitats, prompting re-vegetation efforts to slow wind erosion. These processes alter both the structure and composition of the vegetation, and thus could influence predator and prey abundances, and their interactions. We investigated how habitat structure (degraded [sparse], natural [intermediate], or re-vegetated [dense]) influences lizard species richness, abundance, and diversity, and the interactions between these predators and invertebrate prey in the arid desert steppe. Structurally sparse and dense vegetation supported higher lizard abundances than natural habitats, with Phrynocephalus frontalis and Eremias argus dominating sparse and dense habitats respectively, and P. frontalis and E. multiocellata co-dominating natural habitats. Habitats that were structurally dense also supported the most complex trophic interactions among predators and prey, whereas structurally sparse habitats had low interaction diversity and interaction evenness, with most energy flowing along few trophic pathways. Steppe degradation therefore simplifies community trophic interactions, and restoration through enhanced protection of natural steppe habitat structure may play an important role in the conservation of healthy predator–prey communities. Desertification is a pressing issue throughout most of the arid steppe; revegetation efforts resulted in robust communities, in addition to promoting persistence of E. argus, which is endemic and threatened. Maintaining a heterogenous structural landscape thus may be the most promising way to combat desertification while at the same time restoring predator–prey community composition.","For help with fieldwork, we thank X.

330,pub.1040929676,10.1899/11-098.1,,,,East Coast vs West Coast: effects of an insecticide in communities containing different amphibian assemblages,"The importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying insecticide disturbances in natural systems is growing because of increasing global insecticide use. Despite the prevalence of pesticides and the vulnerability of aquatic systems to insecticides, little is understood about the effect of lower concentrations of insecticides (<1ppm) on aquatic community interactions. Whether insecticide effects are generalizable across different aquatic assemblages and trophic levels also is unclear. Furthermore, few investigators have examined the indirect consequences of insecticides beyond the primary consumer level. We examined how a single application of malathion at 3 concentrations (0, 6, or 40g/L) and the presence or absence of zooplankton predators (larval salamanders) affected aquatic communities composed of zooplankton, phytoplankton, periphyton, and 2 geographically distinct amphibian assemblages from Oregon and Pennsylvania. At these concentrations, malathion was directly lethal to certain zooplankton species, causing a shift from cladoceran-dominated assemblages to copepod-dominated assemblages. The decrease in cladoceran abundance released top-down pressure on phytoplankton, allowing an increase in phytoplankton abundance. The increase in phytoplankton was associated with a decrease in periphyton (the major food source of anurans) because of competition between phytoplankton and periphyton. We did not find direct mortality in anurans or salamanders, but the insecticide-mediated reduction in zooplankton indirectly caused a decrease in larval salamander mass. In contrast, anurans exposed to malathion were heavier at metamorphosis. Overall, these results demonstrate that low concentrations of insecticides have indirect consequences on nontarget members of the community across multiple trophic levels, and the indirect insecticide-mediated effects are generalizable across 2 geographically distinct amphibian assemblages.","We are grateful to Devin Jones for his assistance in conducting this experiment and Maya Groner, Josh Auld, and Chris Cox for their help in the take down.

Most species are zonally distributed; however, on the eastern and western sides of the Indian Ocean, species ranges are extended north or south by boundary currents. Factor analysis was used to cluster phenotypically similar species based on 130 characters taken from the maxilla (a feeding appendage), the first swimming foot, and the fifth foot (a secondary sexual structure). Four morphological clusters were extracted. Clusterings based on separate factor analyses limited to characters from feeding or from sexually adapted appendages are in substantial agreement with the clusters based on composite morphology. Two geographically recurrent groups of species were also identified, one from equatorial waters, one from the central gyre. Each recurrent group is composed of species exceptionally different in body size and belonging to different morphological clusters. Niches of the species are compared using Hutchinson's multidimensional hypervolume as a model. An attempt is made to describe the niche of each species in terms of environmental variables measured at stations where the species was abundant. Environmental variables (dimensions) included in this study are space, time, temperature, food, oxygen and salinity. Mean niche adaptations of most of the species are separable from congeners along at least one niche dimension. It is proposed that community relationships among the Candaciidae developed to prevent both gamete loss and to avoid trophic competition. It is postulated that newly evolving species underwent contemporaneous displacement of both secondary sexual and trophic characters as a condition for sympatry, or diverged in their physiological adaptations to escape sympatric interference.",,,Marine Biology,,Springer Nature,"0025-3162, 1432-1793",,1977-09,1977,,1977-09,43,1,71-92,Closed,Article,"Lawson, T.

We used dynamic simulations in a food web model of central Puget Sound, Washington, USA developed in the Ecopath with Ecosim software, to examine how the marine community may respond to changes in coverage of native eelgrass (Zostera marina), and how these modeled responses can be assessed using an ecosystem services framework, expressing these services with economic currencies in some cases and biological proxies in others. Increased eelgrass coverage was most associated with increases in commercial and recreational fishing with some small decreases in one non-market activity, bird watching. When we considered ecosystem service categories that are aggregations of individual groups of species, we saw little evidence of strong tradeoffs among marine resources; that is, increasing eelgrass coverage was essentially either positive or neutral for all services we examined, although we did not examine terrestrial activities (for example, land use) that affect eelgrass coverage. Within particular service categories, however, we found cases where the responses to changes in eelgrass of individual groups of species that provide the same type of ecosystem service differed both in the magnitude and in the direction of change. This emphasizes the care that should be taken in combining multiple examples of a particular type of ecosystem service into an aggregate measure of that service.",,,Ecosystems,,Springer Nature,"1432-9840, 1435-0629",,2012-11-07,2012,2012-11-07,2013-03,16,2,237-251,Closed,Article,"Plummer, Mark L.; Harvey, Chris J.; Anderson, Leif E.; Guerry, Anne D.; Ruckelshaus, Mary H.","Plummer, Mark L.

We studied the effects of a pathogenic fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) on community interactions between two sympatric North American anurans: Fowler's toad, Bufo fowleri, and the gray treefrog, Hyla chrysoscelis. Recent studies have identified chytridiomycosis as an emerging infectious disease, whose widespread occurrence poses a significant risk for amphibian populations. We manipulated the presence of B. dendrobatidis in replicated experimental tanks and examined if exposure to this fungus during development could influence recruitment and competitive interactions between larval Bufo and Hyla. Tanks were followed throughout larval development, and we recorded survival, time to metamorphosis, and body mass at metamorphosis. We also tested the effects of competitive and pathogen‐mediated stress on developmental stability by measuring fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of surviving metamorphs. B. dendrobatidis had no significant effect on larval survival, but the pathogen reduced metamorphic body mass and increased larval‐period length. B. dendrobatidis had different effects on larval growth depending on the community structure; in the presence of the pathogen, both Bufo and Hyla metamorphosed at smaller body masses when reared together compared to when reared separately. Bufo also had strong negative effects on Hyla development, but only in the presence of B. dendrobatidis. FA of hind‐limb length was significantly higher for metamorphs from pathogen tanks, but was not associated with density or competitive environment. Our results suggest that chytridiomycosis may impact Bufo and Hyla directly by reducing life‐history performance and increasing developmental instability, and indirectly by inducing interspecific competitive effects in mixed‐species environments.","Joyce Longcore graciously supplied the Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis isolates.

We discovered an entropic Kleiber’s Law between bacterioplankton phylum total directed interactions and population and community abundane, with an average exponent Φ ≃ 2 3 in striking accordance with theoretical expectations. The taxa-independent allometric relationship largely varies by habitat (shifting from 2/3 to 3/4 as power-exponent) and is better explained by the community abundance spectrum and its organization than by the envirome defined by environmental interactions. Yet, greater envirome disorganization meant higher environmental impacts causing larger bacteriome disorganization toward random interaction topologies and higher Kleiber’s Law exponents. Habitat-related bacteriome differences revealed that keystone phyla were highly interacting and rare (like Acidobacteria, SBR1093, and ZB3) maintaining weak but salient interactions with both rare (like Spirochaetes and Firmicutes) and dominant phyla. Consistent with their small divergence from main Kleiber’s law and abundance spectrum patterns cosmopolitan phyla, like Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, were dominant but weakly interacting (in magnitude) emphasizing the importance of weak ties in collective dynamics. The most salient interactions were always between phyla with high and low node centrality defined by their total directed interactions and abundance. Envirome network centrality shows temperature and nutrient concentrations (total and dissolved organic phosphorus) as central in estuarine habitats impacted by both global ocean factors and near-shore river effluxes; salinity and suspended particle matter were central in more off-shore habitats. Our results emphasize the importance of a probabilistic assessment of community interactions over individual bacterial abundance analyses when searching for collective patterns informative of ecosystem state and their environmental determinants.","E.G. acknowledges the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) for his PhD fellowship at Hokkaido University, JP.

Network analysis is a valuable tool for studying plant-pollinator interactions, but these networks are most frequently built by aggregating interactions at the species level. Interactions are between individuals and an advantage of individual-based networks is the ability to integrate inter-individual variation in traits and environmental context within complex ecological networks. We studied the influence of inter-individual variation on pollinator sharing among foundation shrubs and cactus in a desert ecosystem using plant individual-based pollinator visitation networks. We hypothesized that the traits that alter attractiveness of plants to pollinators will also influence an individual plant's role within the visitation network. Foundation plants growing with higher densities of nearby blooming shrubs had higher pollinator visitation rates and had greater access to the conspecific mating pool, suggesting widespread and diffuse pollination facilitation within this community. Further, shrub density influenced the role of betweenness centrality and the effective number of partners (eH). Floral display size also influenced the effective number of interaction partners but did not directly influence the centrality measures for individual plants or other measures of network structure despite increasing visitation rates. The individual-based visitation networks were significantly modular and module membership was predicted by species identity and pollinator visitation rates. Ecological and individual context mediate the outcome of pollinator-mediated interactions and are fundamental drivers of whole community structure. This study shows that the density of immediate neighbours can influence the overall structure of plant-pollinator interaction networks. Exploring the contribution of intraspecific variation to community interaction networks will improve our understanding of drivers of community-level ecological dynamics.","The authors thank Dr. Jim Andre and Dr. Tasha La Doux of the University of California Sweeney Granites Desert Research Centre for providing the research site, accommodation, and logistics.

Here, we characterized the bacterial microbiome of the marine sponge Haliclona cnidata that has been in culture in an artificial marine aquarium system. We tested the hypotheses (1) that the long-term aquarium cultured sponge H. cnidata is tightly associated with a typical sponge bacterial microbiota and (2) that the symbiotic Bacteria sustain bioactivity under harmful environmental conditions to facilitate holobiont survival by preventing pathogen invasion. Microscopic and phylogenetic analyses of the bacterial microbiota revealed that H. cnidata represents a high microbial abundance (HMA) sponge with a temporally stable bacterial community that significantly shifts with changing aquarium conditions. A 4-week incubation experiment was performed in small closed aquarium systems with antibiotic and/or light exclusion treatments to reduce the total bacterial and photosynthetically active sponge-associated microbiota to a treatment-specific resilient community. While the holobiont was severely affected by the experimental treatment (i.e., bleaching of the sponge, reduced bacterial abundance, shifted bacterial community composition), the biological defense and bacterial community interactions (i.e., quorum sensing activity) remained intact. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing revealed a resilient community of 105 bacterial taxa, which remained in the treated sponges. These 105 taxa accounted for a relative abundance of 72–83% of the bacterial sponge microbiota of non-treated sponge fragments that have been cultured under the same conditions. We conclude that a sponge-specific resilient community stays biologically active under harmful environmental conditions, facilitating the resilience of the holobiont. In H. cnidata, bacteria are located in bacteriocytes, which may have contributed to the observed phenomenon.","We gratefully acknowledge Sabine Agel, Barbara Hönig, and Anna Möbus from the Imaging Unit, Justus Liebig University Giessen for their excellent technical assistance.

The profound diversity of bacterial and fungal species found in certain environments, such as soil, provides a large pool of potential microbial partners that can interact in ways that reveal patterns of associations linking host–microbiome traits developed over time. However, most microbiome sequence data are reported as a community fingerprint, without analysis of interaction networks across microbial taxa through time. To address this knowledge gap, more robust tools are needed to account for microbiome dynamics that could signal a beneficial change to a plant or animal host. In this paper, we discuss applying mathematical tools, such as dynamic network modelling, which involves the use of longitudinal data to study system dynamics and microbiomes that identify potential alterations in microbial communities over time in response to an environmental change. In addition, we discuss the potential challenges and pitfalls of these methodologies, such as handling large amounts of sequencing data and accounting for random processes that influence community dynamics, as well as potential ways to address them. Ultimately, we argue that components of microbial community interactions can be characterized through mathematical models to reveal insights into complex dynamics associated with a plant or animal host trait. The inclusion of interaction networks in microbiome studies could provide insights into the behaviour of complex communities in tandem with host trait modification and evolution.

However, the extent to which changes in farm management systems could alter resistance and resilience is largely unknown, especially in response to climate change. Plant and soil microbial community interactions are a vital component of functioning and resilient agroecosystems. The aim of our study was to use winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and pea (Pisum sativum L.) plant–soil feedbacks (i.e. plant species-specific effects on soil biota and their impacts on subsequent plant growth) as a metric of system resilience and resistance to climate variability in three different farming management systems: 1) a chemical no-till system, 2) an USDA-certified organic system reliant on tillage and 3) an USDA-certified organic system that included sheep grazing with the overall goal of minimizing tillage intensity. Climate conditions soil experienced were ambient, warmer, and warmer and drier and were manipulated in the field using open-top chamber and rain-out shelters. Plant–soil feedbacks were negative for wheat and positive for pea but varied among farming management systems but were less sensitive to climate conditions. Plant–soil feedbacks were lower in magnitude in the tilled organic system indicating more resistance to the accumulation of pathogenic soil microbiota resulting from repeated cropping of wheat. However, recovery was lower when the crop was pea in the tilled organic indicating slower recovery and less resilience. Results indicate that while increases in crop diversity may promote more resilient agroecosystems, farming management will affect agroecosystem resilience.","We would like to thank Ali Thornton, Everet Owen, Nate Kerznar, Genna Shaia, Tessa Scott, Madison Nixon, Dr. Subodh Adhikari, and Lee Warren for their assistance in maintaining or harvesting the greenhouse experiment.

This paper presents a management succession model and outlines methods that can be applied to regional land-use, rangeland, and agro-ecosystem, management. Traditionally, succession has been viewed as a repeatable and deterministic change in an ecosystem. Unlike the traditional view, the management succession model suggests that the successional process can be regulated to develop management designed communities. The model is based on current succession theory and consists of five steps; designed disturbance, selective colonization, inhibitory persistence, removal, and regeneration. Through the steps of the model, community interactions, life-history characteristics, and those abiotic factors that are to some extent controllable, are manipulated. The objective in manipulating these factors is to regulate successional sequences and rates of species replacement.
                  To implement these steps a management practice, such as burning, can be used as a designed disturbance. The timing, intensity, and extent, of burning are regulated to insure that ‘selected colonizers’ become established. The design of the disturbance, and the selection of species and proportions of colonizers, is based upon the type of community structure that is wanted. Often a stable, persisting community is the goal. How long a community persists can be controlled by planned removal, which deliberately interrupts a successional sequence. The removal process can, in itself, be considered a type of disturbance, and can be used to regulate subsequent successional sequences and rates of replacement. In some instances a regenerating community is the goal, and management efforts can be adjusted to prevent successional sequences from occurring.",,,Environmental Conservation,,Cambridge University Press (CUP),"0376-8929, 1469-4387",,1984,1984,2009-08-24,1984,11,4,323-330,Closed,Article,"Rosenberg, Diane B.; Freedman, Stephen M.","Rosenberg, Diane B.

Despite a general acceptance that some chronic diseases are caused by mixed microbial communities, areas of research exploring community interactions as they relate to the alteration of virulence are still in the early stages. Members of the NIH Human Microbiome Project have been actively characterizing the microbial communities of the skin, nasal, oral, gastrointestinal, and urogenital cavities of healthy adults. Concomitantly, several independent studies have begun to characterize the oral, nasal, sinus, upper and lower respiratory microbiomes in healthy and diseased human tissue. The interactions among the members of these polymicrobial communities have not been thoroughly explored and it is clear there is a need to identify the functional interactions that drive population-level virulence if new therapeutic approaches to chronic disease are to be developed. For example, multiple studies have examined the role of quorum sensing (QS) in microbial virulence, and QS antagonists are being developed and tested as novel therapeutics. Other potential targets include the Gram-negative type III signaling system (T3SS), type IV pili, and two component regulatory systems (TCRS). Initial results from these studies indicate limited efficacy in vivo, further suggesting that the interactions in a heterogeneous community are complex and poorly understood. If progress is to be made in the development of more effective treatments for chronic diseases, a better understanding of the composition and functional interactions that occur within multi-microbial communities must be developed.",,,Frontiers in Biology,,Springer Nature,"1674-7984, 1674-7992",,2011-11-23,2011,2011-11-23,2011-12,6,6,435-445,Closed,Article,"Leid, Jeff G.; Cope, Emily","Leid, Jeff G.

Tarsonemus ips, T. kranzti and T. fusarii (Acarina: Tarsonemidae) may interact within this community in ways that link the population dynamics of D. frontalis, the mites and three dominant species of fungi. We explored species associations by comparing the dietary suitability of different fungi for Tarsonemus spp. 2 All three mite species fed and reproduced at high rates when feeding on the bluestain fungus, Ophiostoma minus, which is an antagonist of D. frontalis larvae. 3 Mites also had positive population growth rates when feeding upon Ceratocystiopsis ranaculosus, one of the mycangial fungi, but could barely reproduce when feeding upon Entomocorticium sp. A, the mycangial fungus that is most suitable for D. frontalis. 4 During the time from colonization of a tree by D. frontalis adults until departure from the tree of their progeny (≈ 40 d at 30 °C), mite populations feeding upon O. minus can increase by factors of up to 209 (T. fusarii), 173 (T. ips) or 384 (T. krantzi). These high growth rates are allowed by rapid development (age of first reproduction = 8–9 d), high fecundity (≈ 1 egg/d) and high longevity (> 28 d). 5 Precocious mating increases the chance that females are mated prior to colonizing a new tree and arrhenotokous parthenogenesis permits reproduction by unmated females. 6 Tarsonemus mites may introduce negative feedback into D. frontalis population dynamics by generating indirect interactions between D. frontalis and O. minus.",,,Agricultural and Forest Entomology,,Wiley,"1461-9555, 1461-9563",,2000-08,2000,2008-10-09,2000-08,2,3,193-202,Closed,Article,"Lombardero, María J.; Klepzig, Kier D.; Moser, John C.; Ayres, Matthew P.","Lombardero, María J.

330,pub.1146885107,10.1111/jzo.12968,,,,Prey responses to predation risk under chronic road noise,"Anthropogenic noise has dramatically increased over the past decades with potentially significant impacts on wildlife and their community interactions. Using giving‐up densities (GUDs) paired with camera traps, we examined the concurrent influence of chronic road noise and predation risk on free‐living small mammals. Specifically, we looked for differences in foraging and vigilance behavior during various noise treatments. We found that small mammals significantly reduced food intake when exposed to predation risk; however, concurrent exposure to road noise eliminated this effect; small mammals increased food intake when exposed to road noise and risk compared to risk alone. Furthermore, road noise reduced the number of visits and time spent at foraging trays while it increased vigilance behavior of small mammals in risky situations, meaning they were able to increase their foraging efficiency. Mice also ate less when moon illumination was greater; however, this had no effect on our overall results. This is one of the first studies to concurrently examine the effects of road noise and predation risk on free‐living prey. It shows the complex responses of prey exposed to chronic noise conditions as they attempt to gain reliable information about predation risk and respond appropriately. We highlight the potential consequences road noise may have on the survival of prey as it interferes with their appropriate risk responses. We tested the influence of road noise on prey responses to predation risk. We found that road noise reduced risk‐induced increases in vigilance and increased risk‐induced reductions in food intake. Our results support the hypothesis that road noise interferes with small mammals' ability to detect predator cues and respond appropriately to predation risk.","We would like to thank the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth&#x27;s Office of Undergraduate Research for funding this study, as well as Leah McKay for providing technical support pertaining to the playbacks necessary for this research.",,Journal of Zoology,,Wiley,"0952-8369, 1469-7998",,2022-04-05,2022,2022-04-05,2022-06,317,2,147-157,Closed,Article,"Giordano, A.; Hunninck, L.; Sheriff, M.

Host-switching of native and non-native parasites could enhance or dilute parasite transmission and spread among hosts. We investigated the effect of host invasion on trematode parasitism in 2 Newfoundland (Canada) bays: one invaded by European green crabs
                    Carcinus maenas
                    and the other not yet invaded. To determine the influence of

                    (first- and second-intermediate hosts for microphallid trematodes, respectively). We found no difference in trematode prevalence between the bays among the 4 host species. However, cyst abundance was significantly higher in
                    C. maenas
                    versus
                    C. irroratus
                    in the bay where the crab distributions overlap, while it was lower in
                    C. irroratus
                    in the invaded versus uninvaded bay, suggesting a dilution of infection in the native host. Sequencing data of microphallid trematodes detected 4 genetically divergent lineages: a cosmopolitan lineage found in all host species; 2 lineages dominant in

Ptarmigan species Lagopus spp., and especially Rock Ptarmigan L. mutus, were the Gyr Falcons’ most important prey and constituted more than 90% of the prey biomass. A 21‐fold difference in ptarmigan abundance was found across Falcon breeding territories. However, this great variation in prey availability corresponded to only about a 10% shift in Gyr Falcon diet across territories, suggesting that the Falcons were reluctant or unable to compensate for declining ptarmigan availability by using alternative prey categories. Gyr Falcons did not respond functionally to microtine rodent abundance. Their diets were unaffected by a peak in the microtine rodent population cycle when Norwegian Lemmings Lemmus lemmus occurred in high numbers in the study area. Gyr Falcons responded numerically to their prey in two ways. First, there was a reproductive response with a significant relationship between the number of chicks fledged and the number of ptarmigan in the breeding territories. Secondly, although the Gyr Falcons did not utilize microtines as prey, there was a relationship between the microtine rodent abundance and the number of pairs that attempted to breed each year. This could be a result of an indirect community interaction, assuming that other predators switched from ptarmigan to microtines as prey, which could have had a positive effect on the breeding performance of the Gyr Falcons. The Gyr Falcons acted as true specialist predators, and their narrow food niche probably reflected a general lack of suitable alternative prey in the study area.","We wish to thank Bert‐Ove Lindström of Projekt Jaktfalk Norrbotten, Martin Tjernberg of the Swedish Species Information Center (Artdatabanken) and field workers of SarPad and Projekt Jaktfalk Norrbotten.

330,pub.1027690750,10.1007/s10393-005-3877-5,,,,Testing the Generality of a Trophic-cascade Model for Plague,"Climate may affect the dynamics of infectious diseases by shifting pathogen, vector, or host species abundance, population dynamics, or community interactions. Black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomysludovicianus) are highly susceptible to plague, yet little is known about factors that influence the dynamics of plague epizootics in prairie dogs. We investigated temporal patterns of plague occurrence in black-tailed prairie dogs to assess the generality of links between climate and plague occurrence found in previous analyses of human plague cases. We examined long-term data on climate and plague occurrence in prairie dog colonies within two study areas. Multiple regression analyses revealed that plague occurrence in prairie dogs was not associated with climatic variables in our Colorado study area. In contrast, plague occurrence was strongly associated with climatic variables in our Montana study area. The models with most support included a positive association with precipitation in April–July of the previous year, in addition to a positive association with the number of “warm” days and a negative association with the number of “hot” days in the same year as reported plague events. We conclude that the timing and magnitude of precipitation and temperature may affect plague occurrence in some geographic areas. The best climatic predictors of plague occurrence in prairie dogs within our Montana study area are quite similar to the best climatic predictors of human plague cases in the southwestern United States. This correspondence across regions and species suggests support for a (temperature-modulated) trophic-cascade model for plague, including climatic effects on rodent abundance, flea abundance, and pathogen transmission, at least in regions that experience strong climatic signals.","We gratefully acknowledge the City of Boulder Open Space Department, and Boulder County Parks and Open Space Department, particularly Mark Gershman, Cary Richardson, Bryan Pritchett, Lynn Riedel, Mark Brennan, Ann Wickman, and Jeanne Scholl for providing data on plague occurrence and information on prairie dog colonies in Boulder County.

330,pub.1023954097,10.1007/s00227-016-2929-4,,,,Effects of the receiving assemblage and disturbance on the colonisation of an invasive species,"While the consequences of bioinvasions are becoming clearer, our understanding of the environmental and ecological factors driving them is limited due to the complexity of the invasion process. Invasion success can be considered to be influenced by characteristics of the receiving assemblage (habitat, food, community interactions) and disturbances. Studies on the effects of the receiving assemblage have typically focused on a single or small subset of species, rather than on complex, multitrophic assemblages. We used an experimental assemblage consisting of more than 30 taxa from multiple trophic levels to evaluate the importance of the presence of this community and disturbance on colonisation by a generalist invader. To achieve this, we compared colonisation between a disturbed and undisturbed community. In addition, we evaluated the effects of the presence of organic matter of a different source (simulating a disturbance event affecting different habitats) on colonisation. A model generalist invader, the isopod Cirolana harfordi, was introduced to patches of oyster beds with (1) undisturbed (live) assemblages, (2) disturbed assemblages, (3) organic matter (using organic matter of a different source), or (4) no assemblage or organic matter. Our results indicated that the presence of an assemblage (disturbed or not) fostered colonisation; however, colonisation was less successful when the assemblage was undisturbed. Results also indicate that for a disturbance event to affect the colonisation of C. harfordi, it has to directly affect the invaded assemblage. These results add to the understanding of the factors driving invasions, which is important to design management strategies.","This work was funded by an International Postgraduate Research Scholarship and Sydney Institute of Marine Science Doctoral Fellowship to A.

We evaluated trematode parasite diversity and the potential for host-switching of parasites in 3 co-occurring crabs in the Northeast USA, including 1 native species (Cancer irroratus) and 2 non-natives (Carcinus maenas , Hemigrapsus sanguineus) , of which the former represents a historical and the latter a contemporary invader. At 7 sites from Maine to Rhode Island, we surveyed crabs for trematode infection prevalence and abundance, and the influence of parasitism on host body condition. We also conducted DNA sequencing using the 18S rRNA barcoding marker to determine species composition, diversity, and gene flow of trematode lineages among the co-occurring hosts. While the native host, C. irroratus , and the historical invader, C. maenas , exhibited no statistical difference in trematode prevalence, we found that C. maenas had a greater abundance of metacercarial cysts than the other 2 hosts, and the contemporary invader, H. sanguineus , was rarely infected. Crab condition did not vary with infection abundance, although infected females of all species had higher reproductive investment than other groups. Genetic analyses revealed that the microphallid trematodes consisted of 3 main clades, representing over 50 haplotypes, with evidence of host-switching by native parasites utilizing the non-native hosts. Given the importance of crustaceans to parasite life cycles, the introduction of novel hosts to these systems alters both free-living and host-parasite community interactions and could ultimately affect community structure and function.

The development of attached diatom communities in two reservoirs was studied using artificial substrates, and the morphology of dominant organisms, patterns of spatial heterogeneity, and community interactions were documented with scanning electron microscopy. Of 93 taxa found, Gomphonema parvulum, G. olivaceum, Navicula graciloides, Nitzschia palea, and N. dissipata were dominant, depending upon season and reservoir. Comparisons of community diversity (SIMI) between reservoirs within seasons ranged from 0.023–0.843 (median = 0.254), indicating that the reservoirs were quite different with respect to diatoms present and their apportionments. Colonization was slow the first 2 wk in spring and fall, and throughout winter, but rapid during summer. Shifts in numerical dominance between certain species occurred in fall, spring, and summer. These inverse correlations of abundances and the functional dominance of overgrowth suggested competition for substrate surface area in the periphyton. The colonization sequence was often predictable—a presumably organic coating and a variety of bacteria, followed by low profile diatoms, and finally an upperstory of long‐stalked and large‐rosette diatoms and filamentous green algae. Periphyton microsuccession is similar to higher plant succession in the consistent change in vertical community structure from low to high physical stature, in the association of numerical dominance with large stature (via cell size or long mucilaginous stalks), and in the progressive slow‐down in the rate of succession. Diatom mucilage also contributed to community structure by binding particulates and entrapping other algae and serving as the mechanism for substrate attachment.",,,American Journal of Botany,,Wiley,"0002-9122, 1537-2197",,1982-02,1982,,1982-02,69,2,188-213,Closed,Article,"Hoagland, Kyle D.; Roemer, Stephen C.; Rosowski, James R.","Hoagland, Kyle D.

The ERH is a highly-cited explanation for invasion success, yet rigorous evidence is lacking for most species and ecosystems. Most evidence comes from observations of enemies in native and introduced ranges. These studies assess one aspect of the ERH—“enemy loss.” They do not provide a direct test of the ERH and overlook the assumption of “native enemy effects.” This is a critical limitation as enemy release will not occur if enemies do not affect species in their native ranges, even if enemy loss occurs. Biogeographical experiments, providing a direct test of the ERH, are largely restricted to terrestrial plants. We present a synthesis of community ecology and invasion biology studies, including a novel meta-analysis of native enemy effects, to assess the potential for release for species in different taxonomic groups and ecosystems. We suggest that species that are subject to strong enemy effects in their native range will have a high potential for enemy release. We found that native enemy effects were stronger in aquatic systems than in terrestrial systems. They were particularly weak for terrestrial plants; and strong for marine organisms, and freshwater plants. Studies are needed for species that have strong potential for release, such as for aquatic invasive species. Alternative explanations should be explored for invasive species that are not affected by enemies in their native range, and future studies should emphasize native enemy effects rather than only enemy loss.","We thank G.

Growing evidence shows that human activity can impact carnivore behavior and community structure by altering predator-prey interactions, shifting diel activity patterns, and altering wildlife movement. Our goal was to investigate the ecological role of bobcats (Lynx rufus) across carnivore communities in the continental USA by quantifying variation in spatiotemporal patterns and determining what environmental and human factors influenced carnivore community interactions. Using camera trap data from the inaugural nationwide Snapshot USA project dataset collected from September – October 2019, we constructed diel activity density curves, applied multispecies occupancy models, and calculated attraction-avoidance ratios. Our results suggest that bobcats display the greatest flexibility in their diel activity among the suite of carnivores sampled. Further, bobcats respond differentially at large spatial scales relative to the presence of dominant or subordinate carnivores, with fluctuating impacts mediated by human and environmental factors. Bobcats’ co-occurrence with dominant carnivores (i.e., wolves Canis sp., pumas Puma concolor) was influenced primarily by human-related factors, whereas co-occurrence with subordinate carnivores (i.e., foxes) was more influenced by environmental factors (i.e., precipitation, gross primary production [GPP]). Bobcats appear to interpret humans as the apex predator on the landscape regardless of the presence of dominant or subordinate species. Understanding the influence of humans as “super predators’’, as well as the importance of environmental factors that impact intraguild carnivore interactions across the USA is critical for establishing successful management practices to promote functioning communities.","We acknowledge Snapshot 2019, which was a collaborative effort among scientists across the U.S.A. who contributed to the inaugural wildlife camera-trap survey producing a database accessible to the public.

An NPK-type substituted organic fertilizer (SOF) was formulated using available nature-based materials, and its effect on bacterial diversity, richness and community composition investigated during the remediation of a long-term crude oil-impacted soil. Results obtained were compared to a control and a chemical fertilizer (CF) treatment. The rate of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) degradation was observed to be highest in the SOF treatment (0.022 d – 1) compared to the CF (0.016 d – 1) and control treatments (0.001 d – 1). Improvement of bacterial diversity in the SOF treatment significantly correlated with pH and soil organic matter (SOM). Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum across all the treatment systems. Acidocella was dominant in both the control and CF treatments, while Brevundimonas and Alcanivorax were the most abundant genera in the SOF treatment. The bacterial community structure and composition were significantly differentiated (PERMANOVA, p ≤ 0.01) in the different treatment processes. Constrained redundancy analysis revealed that pH, SOM, calcium, TPH and potassium influences the bacterial community composition. Analysis of bacterial community interaction suggests that there was higher efficiency in information processing and chemical transmission in the SOF treatment compared to the CF treatment. PICRUSt2-based functional prediction revealed that dissimilatory/assimilatory nitrate reduction and denitrification were among biomarkers in the nutrient amended treatments, while enzymes for nitrogen fixation were differentially abundant in the control treatment. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that the formulated NbS-fertilizer might stimulate more rapid biodegradation by improving soil nutrients and the proliferation of diverse microbial species in oil-polluted soils.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"This work was supported by the Nigerian Conservation Foundation/Chevron Nigeria Limited [2018 Chief S.

This follows the Albion‐Marshall School District merger in 2014 along with the increased requirement of K‐12 science education in the State of Michigan. The need for science exposure and cross‐community interaction between the towns of Marshall and Albion lent itself to an opportunity for the students at Albion College. With many of our current students at Albion College experiencing the merger firsthand, we understood the potential of our impact upon younger generations that had not previously had meaningful interactions with local college students. The Albion College Biochemistry Club has therefore been designing and executing programming to generate excitement for science in younger generations within the local school district. In a short amount of time, the Biochemistry Club has participated in judging local science fairs, providing demonstrations across varying ages, and supporting local vendors, while instilling a sense of greater purpose within college students. Focusing first on sharing science in the classroom has encouraged our students to explain science in a way that people of all ages can understand. The success of this programing from the Albion College Biochemistry Club has resulted in an influx of member attendance and a feeling of excitement to learn about science from the classrooms we visit.

330,pub.1124622401,10.1007/bf03544454,,,,Bird-epiphyte interactions in three Atlantic Forest environments in southeastern Brazil,"Epiphytes reach up to 67% of the total plant species richness in some tropical areas and act as diverse food resources that can be crucial in times of food scarcity. The avifauna assists in their reproduction, either through pollination or seed dispersal, thus creating a vast interaction spectrum between both communities within a continuous ecological process. Few scientific studies concerning avian and epiphytic community interactions are available and not much is known on their specific relationships. However, their absence can change existing ecological processes in habitats. With this in mind, a study undertaken at the Reserva Ecológica do Guapiaçu, Cachoeiras de Macacu, RJ analyzed bird and epiphytic interactions in three different environments: forest, fragmented forest and pastureland. The aim was to study how these interactions can vary according to their degree of conservation and successional stage. Three observation points were marked in a forest, nine points in forest fragments and ten observation points in the pastureland, thus providing a total of 1056 observation hours. As a result, 643 avian and epiphytic interactions were registered. We tested differences in the number of interactions between the areas. The initial hypothesis was that the largest number of registered interactions would occur in the preserved forest given its preserved state and existing biodiversity; however, the pasture area presented the highest number and variety of interactions. Most of the birds observed in the different habitats presented a high interaction in pasture areas where resource availability is reduced, making epiphytes an important food supply.

Here, we revisited a study conducted three decades ago and used artificial nests to examine depredation rates in a Costa Rican biological corridor. Using camera trap data, we compared potential nest predator detection rates at experimental tinamou ground nests in La Selva Biological Station and at sites in five local forest fragments. Nest predator detections were positively associated with landscape-scale core forest and distance away from forest edge, as well as with local-scale human trails, and negatively associated with primary forest compared to secondary growth. Twenty-two of 52 artificial nests were depredated, which was similar to previous research in the area. Mammalian and avian predators were common nest predators, but unknown predators (presumably snakes) were responsible for half of nests lost. Nests within La Selva core forest had lower probability of nest loss compared to fragments despite exhibiting higher predator detection rates. Yet other fragmentation covariates such as distance from forest edge, nest occurrence on human trails, or forest age were not associated with nest loss. We suggest that concentrated foraging is the underlying mechanism behind the community interactions that we observed. Community members exist in concentrated use areas within forest fragments, which results in heightened predator foraging rates and thus stronger interactions in fragments despite more predators encountering the nests in core forest. Fragmentation is a global phenomenon and we suspect that concentrated community use of limited resources is driving species to interact more strongly than in natural ecosystems.","This research was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP).

In large long‐lived species with low risk of predation for parents, reproductive behaviours often involve caring for offspring (i.e. defending broods from predators) and these behaviours are essential for offspring survival. Our objectives were to test for the presence of natural variation in nest predation pressure in an aquatic environment for a species that provides sole‐paternal care, smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), and to determine if natural variation in predation pressure influences parental care behaviour. We used snorkeler observations and a series of metrics to assess predation pressure and parental care behaviour in six lakes within a narrow geographical range. Lakes differed in all predation pressure metrics: number of predators in proximity to nest when males were present, time to predator arrival and number of predators that consumed eggs when males were absent and total number of nests that was preyed upon. Similarly, parental behaviour varied between lakes. Parental smallmouth bass spent more time engaged in anti‐predator defences in lakes with high predation pressure, while males from low predator pressure lakes remained close to their nest. Conversely, males from lakes with low and high predation pressure showed a similar willingness to defend their nests during simulated nest predation events. Our results show that natural variation in aquatic nest predation pressure across multiple lakes can be significant and has the ability to influence baseline parental care behaviour. Such variation provides opportunities to study the costs and consequences of parental care and to evaluate how this could influence demography and community interactions in aquatic systems.","The authors would like to thank Michelle Caputo, Mike Donaldson, Andrew Gingerich, Kyle Hanson, Sean Landsman, Connie O’Connor, Amanda O’Toole, Rana Sunder and Tara Redpath for their outstanding help in the field.

Nevertheless, dormant stages could potentially have significant impacts on the ecology and evolution of the active population. In Oneida Lake, New York, populations of the suspension‐feeding crustaceans Daphnia galeata mendotae and Daphnia pulicaria produce large numbers of long‐lived diapausing eggs, which accumulate in the sediments to densities of over 2.5 × 104 eggs/m2 for D. galeata mendotae and 8.0 × 104 eggs/m2 for D. pulicaria. Sedimentation rates obtained by 210Pb dating suggest that these eggs can remain viable for >125 yr and that these two Daphnia populations have persisted in this system for >200 yr. Total annual production of new diapausing eggs can range from 0 to over 104 new eggs/m2 of sediment. Annual emergence rates back to the water column are also variable but only range between 0 and 25 Daphnia/m2. Because annual variation in the size of the overwintering water‐column population ranges between 0 and 2.5 individuals/L, the contribution of emergence to the development of the spring population is considerable in some years and negligible in others. Despite similar maximum water‐column densities, D. pulicaria produces and stores more eggs and has a higher rate of emergence than D. galeata mendotae, suggesting differences in the benthic–pelagic link of these two species. Diapausing eggs greatly increase the generation time of the populations that produce them and therefore have the potential to substantially alter the outcome of community interactions.","A. J.

However, less is known about their sources, distributions, functions, and impacts in other marine organisms. We examined the distribution of DMSP in benthic macroalgae and macroinvertebrates geographically and taxonomically. In macroalgae, concentrations significantly increased from the tropics to the poles in the northern, but not the southern, hemisphere. The increase in the northern hemisphere was due to an increase in concentrations with latitude in the Chlorophyta. This pattern was generated by a relatively high proportion of species in the order Ulvales (median [DMSP]: 145 μmol g-1 dry mass (DM)) at higher latitudes, and a high proportion of species in the orders Caulerpales and Siphonocladales (median [DMSP]: below detection level for both orders) in the tropics. Low DMSP concentrations (< 10 μmol g-1 DM) were reported from all red and brown macroalgae, except Polysiphonia and Halopytis. In macroalgae, some of the reported functions of DMSP and its cleavage products included acting as a compatible solute, an anti-herbivore defense, a reactive oxygen scavenger, and a cryoprotectant. Among macroinvertebrates, DMSP occurred in higher concentrations in cnidarians than in sponges and molluscs. Concentrations in animals harboring endosymbiotic algae were 6.5 times higher than animals without symbionts. This and direct measurements of DMSP from isolated symbionts suggest that endosymbionts are a major source of DMSP for some macroinvertebrates. Diet may be a source of DMSP in animals that lack endosymbionts. The functions and impacts of DMSP in invertebrates are not well known.",,,Aquatic Sciences,,Springer Nature,"1015-1621, 1420-9055",,2007-08-08,2007,2007-08-08,2007-09,69,3,394-402,Closed,Article,"Van Alstyne, Kathryn L.; Puglisi, Melany P.","Van Alstyne, Kathryn L.

This program was carried out on the rocky intertidal zone of MPR 33 with the objectives to: 1) determine species richness, 2) community composition based on families represented, 3) estimate the density, 4) index of diversity, 5) analyze body proportions and 6) geographic distribution of species. Three surveys on five sites were conducted during 2009 and 2012, using one mt2 quadrant for systematic sampling procedure; collecting all POLYPLACOPHORA specimens found within the quadrants, then proceeding with their preservation. 441 organisms were analyzed where 17 species were identified, on nine genera within six families. Fifteen new species were recorded for the MPR 33. Family ISCHNOCHITONIDAE Dall, 1889 was the best represented in species richness and CHITONIDAE Rafinesque, 1815 in abundance. Density of 8.82 organisms/m2, the H′ index was 2.38 bits/individuals and J′ = 0.57. The species Chiton (Chiton) articulatus Sowerby, 1832 showed the highest density, greater size and was found in all five collection sites. Three species, (Chiton (C.) articulatus, Ischnochiton (Ischnochiton) muscarius (Reeve, 1847) and Chiton (Chiton) alboli-neatus Broderip & Sowerby, 1829), were considered wide. Intertidal species richness was associated with habitat stability and wave intensity; the more unstable sites had greater richness while most stable sites lower.

In fact, several papers in this Special Profile show that indirect management of the community may be more effective than removal of the invader alone. 4 As little information is generally available at the beginning of a management programme, an adaptive approach should be taken and the management objectives/goals revised throughout the management process. New methods are emerging for adaptive management; an example is presented in this Special Profile where a Bayesian model used for assessing eradication goals can be updated throughout the management process leading to refinement of management. 5 Synthesis and applications. Applied research should be directed at providing decision support for managers throughout the management process and can be used to provide predictive tools for risk assessment of new invaders. The science of invasion ecology has much to contribute to the new challenge of natural or enhanced movement of organisms in relation to climate change.

The rapid thinning, retreat, and collapse of ice shelves along the Antarctic Peninsula are harbingers of warming effects around the entire continent. Ice shelves cover more than 1.5 million km2 and fringe 75% of Antarctica's coastline, delineating the primary connections between the Antarctic continent, the continental ice, and the Southern Ocean. Changes in Antarctic ice shelves bring dramatic and large‐scale modifications to Southern Ocean ecosystems and continental ice movements, with global‐scale implications. The thinning and rate of future ice‐shelf demise is notoriously unpredictable, but models suggest increased shelf‐melt and calving will become more common. To date, little is known about sub‐ice‐shelf ecosystems, and our understanding of ecosystem change following collapse and calving is predominantly based on responsive science once collapses have occurred. In this review, we outline what is known about (a) ice‐shelf melt, volume loss, retreat, and calving, (b) ice‐shelf‐associated ecosystems through sub‐ice, sediment‐core, and pre‐collapse and post‐collapse studies, and (c) ecological responses in pelagic, sympagic, and benthic ecosystems. We then discuss major knowledge gaps and how science might address these gaps. This article is categorized under: Climate, Ecology, and Conservation > Modeling Species and Community Interactions Antarctic ice‐shelf disintegration is re‐shaping the pelagic and benthic realms associated with it. Based on current knowledge, shifts will occur in oceanographic parameters, ice dynamics, and spatial and temporal ranges of organisms, populations and communities, altering predator‐prey and other trophic interactions, benthopelagic coupling, and many other ecological processes and functions, and this far beyond the immediate ice‐shelf areas.

316,pub.1069664153,10.2307/1940794,,,,Biological Responses of a Tundra River to Fertilization,"Phosphorous fertilization of a pristine tundra river for four consecutive summers dramatically changed biological processes and populations at all trophic levels. At the primary producer level, both algal biomass and productivity increased and cholorophyll accumulated on the river bottom in the first two summers. Diatom community composition changed little in spite of large chorophyll changes. However, an increase in grazing insects prevented chlorophyll buildup in the third and fourth summers. Some microbial processes were also stimulated by the increased photosynthesis caused by fertilization. Total respiration of the epilithon, acetate uptake, and decomposition of lignin monomers were all stimulated but only in light—grown epilithon. When epilithon was grown in the dark in the fertilized region of the river, there was no increased respiration. Also, phosphorous did not stimulate the decompostition of Carex litter. Although insects grew more rapidly in the fertilized section of the river, there were community interactions that kept total insect production from appreciable change. The four most abundant large insects did increase their growth rates in response to phosphorus addition and there were increases in populations of Baetis lapponicus and Brachycentrus americanus. These increases were offset by the decline in abundance of the dominant species, the black fly Prosimulium martini, perhaps caused by competition for space from Brachycentrus. Growth of both young—of—the—year and adult grayling (Thymallus arcticus) was strongly stimulated by phosphorus addition in years 3 and 4 (not tested in years 1 and 2). Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope tracers indicated that the measured increases in insect and fish growth were largely attributable to increases in the production of epilithic algae. Overall, the results indicate a strong ""bottom—up"" response of the riverine food web to additions of the limiting nutrient, phosphorus. The response was modified in later years, however, by a strong ""top—down"" feedback of insects grazing on epilithic algae and by competitive exclusion of black flies caddisflies.",,,Ecology,,Wiley,"0012-9658, 1939-9170",,1993-04-01,1993,1993-04-01,1993-04,74,3,653-672,Closed,Article,"Peterson, Bruce J.; Deegan, Linda; Helfrich, John; Hobbie, John E.; Hullar, Meredith; Moller, Bernie; Ford, Tim E.; Hershey, Anne; Hiltner, Allison; Kipphut, George; Lock, Maurice A.; Fiebig, Douglas M.; McKinley, Vicky; Miller, Michael C.; Vestal, J.

Festuca arundinacea (tall fescue) is often infected with the mutualistic fungal endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum. Infected (E+) F. arundinacea has been reported to inhibit soil pathogens, nematodes, and mycorrhizal fungi, and to have greater mineral uptake from the soil relative to uninfected (E−) F. arundinacea. In addition, endophyte presence may indirectly influence the soil by altering the plant–plant interactions and the composition of communities. Recent studies have shown that local plant species diversity was reduced in experimental field plots with E+ F. arundinacea compared to plots with E− plants. Endophyte‐induced changes, direct or indirect, in biotic or abiotic soil properties could therefore affect subsequent plant growth. We investigated soil‐mediated effects of E+ F. arundinacea on E+ and E− F. arundinacea, Trifolium repens, and Plantago lanceolata by growing each in soil collected from the aforementioned field plots seeded with either E+ or E− F. arundinacea. Infection status of F. arundinacea plots had no direct effect on any measured characteristic of plants grown in soil from those plots. However, responses of experimental plants suggest that, by inducing changes in plant community composition, E+ F. arundinacea may indirectly affect the soil. Most notable was an increase in E+ F. arundinacea total biomass when grown in soil previously dominated by Poa pratensis and other grass species compared to biomass when grown in soil previously dominated by E+ F. arundinacea, indicative of an indirect negative feedback on E+ F. arundinacea growth. In addition, Plantago and Trifolium root biomass was significantly higher when grown in soil that previously supported a high proportion of P. pratensis relative to other plant species. Such plant–soil dynamics may have important community‐level implications in areas dominated by F. arundinacea.","We thank Janice Alers‐Garcia, Jenny Holah, Tammy Johnston, Vicky Meretsky, Alissa Packer, Jean Pan, Jason Price, Charles Richardson, Maxine Watson, and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on earlier versions of this paper.

Here, I combine plant defence theory with functional approaches to quantify genetic trait variation and phenotypic trait plasticity of nine goldenrod (Solidago altissima) genotypes derived from a local field population in Connecticut, USA, to herbivory along a nutrient supply gradient. I found that increasing nutrient supply changed the dominant plant defence strategy from tolerance to induced resistance. Induced resistance was detected through decreased herbivore growth rates and a behavioural feeding shift of grasshoppers to older leaf tissue. This could not be fully accounted for through stoichiometric changes in leaf tissue quality. A multidimensional phenotype approach revealed that abiotic and biotic environments (nutrients and herbivory) accounted for almost as much whole‐plant trait variation (31%) as did plant genotype (36%). Increasing nutrient supply and herbivory resulted in independent and differential effects on whole‐plant trait expression. Increasing both treatments concurrently produced a unique plant phenotype with increased leaf carbon content and allocation to asexual reproduction (E × E). Notably, individual genotypes exhibited different magnitudes of multivariate trait plasticity to nutrient and herbivory gradients. However, the population of genotypes as a whole within a given environment expressed an approximately equal magnitude of trait variation across both permissive (high nutrient, no herbivory) and stressful (low nutrient, high herbivory) environments. Quantifying plasticity in defensive strategy in concert with correlated whole‐plant trait expression changes across multiple abiotic and biotic factors may be key to providing a mechanistic understanding of how heterogeneous landscapes impact community interactions and ecosystem processes.

Here, we compare zooplankton communities from freshwater lakes in Norway and Canada that differ in their duration of exposure to the invertebrate predator Bythotrephes longimanus, to aid in predicting its potential long‐term impacts on Canadian zooplankton communities. Freshwater lakes in Canada and Norway. We compared differences in zooplankton community structure, richness and occurrence between lakes with and without Bythotrephes in Canada and Norway using univariate and multivariate analyses of the incidence of crustacean zooplankton species. Correspondence analysis confirmed that zooplankton community composition differed dramatically in lakes with and without Bythotrephes in Canada but not in Norway. The short‐term exposure of Canadian lakes to Bythotrephes led to lower zooplankton diversity, particularly for cladoceran species, whereas in Norway, a greater diversity of zooplankton, particularly for copepod species, occurred in lakes where Bythotrephes has been present for long periods. Significantly more species in Norway demonstrated an increase in their frequency of occurrence, while significantly more species in Canada demonstrated a decrease, in lakes containing Bythotrephes. Bythotrephes can modify zooplankton community structure, diversity, and spatial occurrence across a watershed in a short period (i.e. a few decades) after invasion; however, some species appear to adapt to the presence of Bythotrephes over time. We hypothesize the long‐term effects of higher diversity in Norwegian lakes is attributed to altered interspecific community interactions, coupled with behavioural adaptations to avoid Bythotrephes predation, enabling the remaining species to increase their populations in space and time. If Canadian communities adapt similarly, the long‐term effects of Bythotrephes invasion in Canada may thus be less severe than those observed in the first few decades of the invasion.",We thank Allegra Cairns for heading the sampling of the Canadian Shield 300 lakes survey and the Dorset Environmental Science Centre for water quality analyses.

Caribou and wild reindeer Rangifer tarandus are declining in many regions of their circumpolar range likely because of human‐induced landscape changes. In general, their niche specialization enables Rangifer to survive in nutrient‐poor habitats spatially separated from other ungulates and their shared predators. Research has indicated that shifts in primary prey distribution following human landscape alteration may result in spatial overlap with Rangifer. We studied overlap relationships of woodland caribou R. t. caribou and moose Alces alces, quantified by their differential use of environmental resources, and evaluated the role of human landscape alteration in spatial separation in south‐western Canada. Anthropogenic conversion of old‐growth forests to early seral stands is hypothesized to decrease the spatial separation between caribou and moose, the dominant prey for wolves Canis lupus, contributing to increased caribou mortality. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was first used to examine coarse scale resource separation across our study area. Second, at a finer spatial scale, we used logistic regression to compare resource‐ and spatial separation of sympatric pairs of 17 moose and 17 caribou. Finally, we tested if the frequency of predator‐caused caribou mortalities was higher in regions with higher moose resource use. Although environmental resource separation was strong at the coarser scale, we observed substantial spatial overlap (>50%) at the finer scale. In summer we reported a significant positive relationship between spatial overlap of moose and caribou and the degree of human landscape alteration. Most importantly, locations of caribou mortalities corresponded with areas of high resource use by moose in summer. Thus, consistent with the spatial separation hypothesis, our research suggests that early successional forest stages may decrease spatial separation between caribou and moose, resulting in increased mortality risk for threatened caribou.","Financial and logistical support was provided by the Alberta Conservation Association, Alberta Dept of Sustainable Resource Development, British Columbia Ministry of the Environment, Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, NASA grant no.

The intensity of community interactions and the structure of food webs can be associated with an organism's body size. However, little is known about how interactions among species in multitrophic communities determine the body size of individuals exploiting the same resource. 2. This study evaluates the effects of resource size, fruit infestation, and parasitism on tibia length, a proxy measure of body size, of insects exploiting the same resource. The three most abundant seed‐feeding species of Senegalia tenuifolia (Fabaceae: Mimosoideae) were selected, and the relationship between their tibia length and the interactions within the food web was estimated. The selected species were the beetles Merobruchus terani and Stator maculatopygus, and the braconid wasp Allorhogas vulgaris. 3. The body sizes of 531 specimens were measured and it was found that tibia length of each species responded differently to the interactions, demonstrating that functionally similar species may respond differently to multitrophic effects. The body size of Merobruchus terani, the most abundant species in the food web, was negatively affected by the presence of A. vulgaris, but there was a positive relationship with seed biomass and its own abundance in the fruits. The other two species were less abundant and more plastic in their responses, as a strong negative effect of M. terani presence on A. vulgaris body size was observed, as well as a strong negative effect of Coleoptera parasitism rate on S. maculatopygus body size. 4. It is concluded that morphological traits can provide information on how interactions affect species body size. Species of insects with the same ecological function responded differently to the interactions present in the food web. The most abundant species in the food web (Merobruchus terani) showed consistent responses to ecological interactions, whereas the other two species were less abundant and more plastic in their responses. Morphological traits can provide information on how interactions affect species body size.","Acknowledgements We thank the anonymous referees for their valuable comments on this study.

316,pub.1113159844,10.1002/wcc.585,,,,Projecting biological impacts from climate change like a climate scientist,"Our ability to project changes to the climate via anthropogenic forcing has steadily increased over the last five decades. Yet, biologists still lack accurate projections about climate change impacts. Despite recent advances, biologists still often rely on correlative approaches to make projections, ignore important mechanisms, develop models with limited coordination, and lack much of the data to inform projections and test them. In contrast, atmospheric scientists have incorporated mechanistic data, established a global network of weather stations, and apply multi‐model inference by comparing divergent model projections. I address the following questions: How have the two fields developed through time? To what degree does biological projection differ from climate projection? What is needed to make similar progress in biological projection? Although the challenges in biodiversity projections are great, I highlight how biology can make substantial progress in the coming years. Most obstacles are surmountable and relate to history, lag times, scientific culture, international organization, and finances. Just as climate change projections have improved, biological modeling can improve in accuracy by incorporating mechanistic understanding, employing multi‐model ensemble approaches, coordinating efforts worldwide, and validating projections against records from a well‐designed network of biotic stations. Now that climate scientists can make better projections of climate change, biologists need to project and prevent its impacts on biodiversity. This article is categorized under: Climate, Ecology, and Conservation > Modeling Species and Community Interactions Biologists can learn from the history of climate change science to project climate impacts on biodiversity more accurately to prevent extinctions and mitigate ecosystem disruptions. Above, species projected to decline with climate change include, in order, polar bears, American pika, tuatara, and the recently extinct Bramble Cay Melomys.

This approach recognizes the importance of community interactions such as food web structure and trophic patterns. We determined whether hierarchical clustering (guild formation) is an effective method of trophic evaluation in deep-sea Artic fish communities using stomach content and parasite data with size class, and evaluated the application of endohelminth communities (parasite species transmitted in the food) as indicators of trophic status. Cluster analysis using food group abundance with size class of fish revealed the presence of 11 guilds within the community, however the same analysis using parasite data showed little correlation between food and parasites. Redundancy analysis (RDA) within the 11 guilds also revealed no significant correlations between food group and parasite abundance suggesting that this type of ordination is not suited for environments containing mainly generalist feeders. RDA of individual taxa without a priori guild designation found that taxa in benthic deep-sea communities are defined by their ability to exploit prey species in more than one habitat zone. Benthic fish species were significantly correlated with benthic food groups and parasites that utilize benthic intermediate hosts whereas benthopelagic–pelagic species fed on a higher diversity of prey species and were infected by a larger number of non-host specific parasites. Eigenanalysis and Monte Carlo results showed that parasites and food groups are highly correlated, indicating that parasite community analysis is an effective tool for predicting feeding strategies in Arctic marine environments. It also suggests that in most cases endoparasite infections alone could be used for trophic evaluation in the absence of stomach content data.",,,Environmental Biology of Fishes,,Springer Nature,"0378-1909, 1573-5133",,2005-11,2005,,2005-11,74,3-4,365-378,Closed,Article,"Chambers, Chandra A.; Dick, Terry A.","Chambers, Chandra A.

Therefore, in economic and ecological important areas, such as the English Channel, projections of the future distributions of key species under changing environmental conditions are urgently needed. Ecological Niche Models (ENMs) have been applied successfully to determine potential distributions of species based on the information of the environmental niche of a species (sensu Hutchinson). In this study, the niches of two commercially exploited benthic species, Pecten maximus and Glycymeris glycymeris, and two ecologically important species, Abra alba and Ophelia borealis were derived using four contemporary hydrographic variables, i.e. sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, water depth and sediment type. Consequently, using these ecological envelopes, the Non-Parametric Probalistic Ecological Niche model (NPPEN) was applied to calculate contemporary probabilities of occurrence for each species in the North East Atlantic and to predict potential re-distributions under the climate change scenario A2 for two time periods 2050–2059 and 2090–2099. Results show general northern displacements of the four benthic species from the English Channel into the North Sea and southern Norwegian coast. The projections mostly indicate a reduction of suitable habitat for benthic species with a notable disappearance of their distributions in the English Channel, except for A. alba. However, interpretations should be treated with caution since many uncertainties and assumptions are attached to ecological niche models in general. Furthermore, opening up potential habitats for benthic species does not necessarily imply that the species will actually occupy these sites in the future.

To estimate the importance of indirect effects, we analyzed the population dynamics of nine zooplankton species or species groups in a lake subjected to experimental manipulations of the fish community. The manipulations included additions and removals of planktivorous and piscivorous fish over a period of seven years, thereby producing changes in planktivory rates on the zooplankton community. Applying autoregressive models to time‐series data, collected during weekly samples, we estimated the direct interaction strengths between species, thereby constructing a quantitative interaction web for the zooplankton community. We then used this interaction web to explore the roles of direct and indirect interactions between species in determining the long‐term changes in zooplankton biomasses that were observed over the course of the experimental manipulations. The analysis identified Daphnia pulex as a keystone species. This large herbivore had strong direct interactions with other zooplankton species and was strongly affected by changes in planktivory. Consequently, changes in the biomasses of other zooplankton species during the planktivory manipulations were influenced strongly by indirect interactions acting through changes in D. pulex biomass. In addition, we used the analysis to ask whether information about the response of species to planktivory manipulations could be used to anticipate species’ responses to other types of perturbation. If the direct effects of a novel perturbation on each species in a community were known, then the interaction web would help to anticipate how a novel perturbation will affect each species via direct and indirect effects through the community.","For sampling and analyzing zooplankton data, we thank Pat Soranno and Monica Elser.

To reveal the role of aquatic heterotrophic bacteria in the process of development of Microcystis blooms in natural waters, we cocultured unicellular Microcystis aeruginosa with a natural Microcystis‐associated heterotrophic bacterial community. 2. Unicellular M. aeruginosa at different initial cell densities aggregated into colonies in the presence of heterotrophic bacteria, while axenic Microcystis continued to grow as single cells. The specific growth rate, the chl a content, the maximum electron transport rate (ETRmax) and the synthesis and secretion of extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) were higher in non‐axenic M. aeruginosa than in axenic M. aeruginosa after cell aggregation, whereas axenic and non‐axenic M. aeruginosa displayed the same physiological characteristic before aggregation. 3. Heterotrophic bacterial community composition was analysed by PCR–denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR–DGGE) fingerprinting. The biomass of heterotrophic bacteria strongly increased in the coinoculated cultures, but the DGGE banding patterns in coinoculated cultures were distinctly dissimilar to those in control cultures with only heterotrophic bacteria. Sequencing of DGGE bands suggested that Porphyrobacter, Flavobacteriaceae and one uncultured bacterium could be specialist bacteria responsible for the aggregation of M. aeruginosa. 4. The production of EPS in non‐axenic M. aeruginosa created microenvironments that probably served to link both cyanobacterial cells and their associated bacterial cells into mutually beneficial colonies. Microcystis colony formation facilitates the maintenance of high biomass for a long time, and the growth of heterotrophic bacteria was enhanced by EPS secretion from M. aeruginosa. 5. The results from our study suggest that natural heterotrophic bacterial communities have a role in the development of Microcystis blooms in natural waters. The mechanisms behind the changes of the bacterial community and interaction between cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria need further investigations.","We thank Dr. Susanne Gustafsson for valuable comments on an earlier version of this manuscript, and two anonymous reviewers and Professor Roger Jones for their constructive suggestions and professional editing.

The latter are: bioconstruction and bioturbations, sediment stabilisation and destabilisation, with facilitating and inhibiting effects. This cursory overview intends to show that in near-shore mud and sand, biogenic habitat transformations pervade all community interactions. Consequently these deserve as much attention in benthic ecosystem analyses as do trophic pathways. Abundant phototrophs and suspension feeders tend to accumulate sediment and organic matter. Underneath phototrophic mats, composite layers of anaerobic microorganisms abound. Benthic animals provide anchorage to tufts of algae, and these in turn provide shelter and food for mobile benthos. Rooted plants slow down hydrodynamics and generate complex habitats above the sediment surface but below a meshwork of roots may inhibit burrowing animals. Abundant suspension feeders stabilise sediments, and may build loose hummocks, multi-species epibenthic thickets or solid reefs, accommodating diverse epibenthic assemblages. Their raised and rough surfaces enhance turbulence. Below the sediment surface, tubes and burrows of sessile or discretely motile animals provide microoxic habitats for diverse assemblages of small organisms. At the surface, mucus of motile organisms increases sediment cohesion. Accumulated dead hardparts of the benthos support epibionts when at the surface but cause resistance to the burrowers below. Reworking and irrigation of the sediment by the infauna increases oxygenation, and particulate and solute fluxes with the overlying water. Mounds and pits generated by resident burrowers as well as by large visiting grazers and predators further diversify the benthos. All these bioengineered structures and processes generate dynamic and complex habitat-mediated interaction webs, affecting and meshed into the trophic web, which they may rival in overall importance in the self-structuring of the benthos in coastal marine sediments.",I thank Els Flach and two anonymous referees for constructive criticism of the manuscript.

The functioning of Antarctica's terrestrial ecosystems is dominated by poikilohydric cryptogams such as lichens, bryophytes, eukaryotic algae, and cyanobacteria and there are only two native species of vascular plants. Antarctica's vegetation is highly adapted to the region's extreme conditions but, at the same time, it is potentially highly susceptible to climatic fluctuations. Biological responses to shifts in temperature, water availability, wind patterns, snow, and ice cover are complex, taxa‐specific and act on different temporal and spatial scales. In maritime Antarctica, where warming and mass loss of outlet glaciers have been mainly observed, the vegetation is expected to show increases in productivity, abundance, and cover. In continental Antarctica, observational and experimental evidence is still sparse, but it is pointing toward even drier and harsher conditions for survival. We need more information on what the observed and predicted changes in Antarctic vegetation are for different regions and ecosystems. This will inform us how environmental change and human impact will shape the future of these ecosystems, and whether the speed and magnitude of change have habitat‐specific effects and implications. Antarctica's unique ecosystems are changing and in this review, we describe the current situation, tools to measure, and evaluate change and how change is likely to look in the future.

Predators attracted to ARs can influence the distribution and abundance of prey fish species. Determining the role of predators in AR is important in advancing the understanding of community interactions. This paper documents the effects of predation on fish assemblages of AR located near a coastal lagoon fish nursery. The Dicentrarchus labrax is a very opportunistic species preying on juveniles (0+ and 1+ age classes) of several demersal fish species on the ARs. Reef prey and sea bass abundance were negatively correlated. The mean numbers of prey per sea bass stomach increased with the increase of reef fish prey abundance, suggesting that predation has a significant influence, resulting in a decrease in prey abundance. Prey mortality (4–48%) of demersal reef fish associated species depends on bass density. Prey selection was related both with prey abundance and vulnerability. Results showed that D. labrax predation on AR-fish associated species can increase prey natural mortality. However, the role of bass predation on the ecological functioning of exploited ARs is not clear. There may be increases in local fishing yields due either to an increase in predator biomass through aggregation of sea bass attracted to ARs or to greater production. In contrast, predation on juveniles of economically important reef fish preys, especially the most frequent and abundant (Boops boops), can contribute to a decrease in recruitment to the fishery. Our results indicate that inter-specific interactions (predator–prey) are important in terms of conservation and management, as well as for the evaluation of the long-term effects of reef deployment. Thus, it is necessary to consider ecological interactions, such as predation, prior to the development and deployment of artificial habitats as a tool for rehabilitation.","We would like to thank Pedro Lino, Alexandra Garcia, João Cúrdia and Miguel Gaspar for their help during data collection.

316,pub.1030935938,10.1016/0304-3800(87)90061-5,,,,Analysis of community interactions using linear transfer function models,"Interactions among populations simulated with several ecosystem models and the interactions among populations in a sealed aquatic microcosm were analyzed using linear transfer function models. A transfer function is composed of the sum of three components: a deterministic transfer function (F), a stochastic input function (G), and a white-noise error time series (e). The model has the form: y(t) = F{x(t), ŷ(t−1)} + G{n(t), r̂(t−1)} + e(t), where y(t) is an output time series, x(t) is an input time series, ^y(t−1) is the estimate of y(t−1) based on F alone, n(t) is an unobserved white-noise time series, and r̂(t−1) is the estimate of the residual series r(t−1) = y(t−1) − ŷ(t−1) based on G alone. The deterministic transfer function accounts for the pattern in the output time series that is attributable to the interaction between the input and output variables. The stochastic input function accounts for the remaining pattern in the output time series.The deterministic portion of these simple linear models could recover most of the pattern in complex modeled systems (r-square generally greater than 0.9). Deterministic interactions were not as readily detected in the microcosm although a significant portion of the pattern could often be recovered with the stochastic input function. The ability to detect relationships among variables in modeled systems but not in the living system suggests that may extant ecological models may be poorly posed. Temporal correlation between variables is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for a mechanistic model based on the interaction between these variables to be successful. The transfer function estimation procedure, therefore, can be a useful tool for identifying potentially important interactions in poorly understood systems before more mechanistic models are developed.",,,Ecological Modelling,,Elsevier,"0304-3800, 1872-7026",,1987-04,1987,,1987-04,36,1-2,101-117,Closed,Article,"Rastetter, Edward B.","Rastetter, Edward B.

Research is needed to understand how changes in habitat structure in these new ecosystems impact community interactions, especially when these manipulations are being proposed to reduce invasive species. We conducted an experiment in Hawaii to determine how changes in habitat structure, represented by leaf litter and understory vegetation, affect the abundance of an invasive generalist predator, the coqui frog (Eleutherodactylus coqui) and its potential prey (invertebrates). This study consisted of four treatments: two vegetation treatments (50% and 100% removal of vegetation with diameter at breast height <5cm) and two leaf litter treatments (50% and 100% removal). Removal of 50% of habitat structure, either vegetation or leaf litter, was not sufficient to produce long-term changes in coqui or invertebrate densities. Only full removal of habitat structure resulted in reduced densities of coqui after four months. The abundance of leaf litter invertebrates and invertebrates flying close to the forest floor was higher in the 100% vegetation removal treatment compared to leaf litter removal treatments, and the abundance of foliage invertebrates was higher in the 100% leaf litter removal treatment compared to vegetation removal treatments. Invertebrate responses were complicated because they not only responded to the loss of habitat but also the reduction of coquis in treatments. Coquis in treatments moved to microhabitats that contained increased prey. Treatments appeared to impact coquis by removing structure needed for diurnal retreats, breeding and foraging. In summary, both the 100% removal of leaf litter or vegetation can reduce coqui densities in relatively small (20m×20m) areas, even when surrounded by intact, invaded forest. This study provides greater understanding of the impact of habitat structure manipulation, a typical management employed to control an invasive frog, in a novel ecosystem.","This research was completed as part of dissertation studies of the lead author who was funded through a generous Quinney Foundation Research Fellowship at Utah State University.

316,pub.1023735986,10.1890/es12-00107.1,,,,An emergent disease causes directional changes in forest species composition in coastal California,"Non‐native forest pathogens can cause dramatic and long‐lasting changes to the composition of forests, and these changes may have cascading impacts on community interactions and ecosystem functioning. Phytophthora ramorum, the causal agent of the emergent forest disease sudden oak death (SOD), has a wide host range, but mortality is concentrated in a few dominant tree species of coastal forests in California and Oregon. We examined interactions between P. ramorum and its hosts in redwood and mixed evergreen forest types over an 80,000 ha area in the Big Sur ecoregion of central California, an area that constitutes the southernmost range of the pathogen and includes forest stands on the advancing front of pathogen invasion. We established a network of 280 long‐term forest monitoring plots to understand how host composition and forest structure facilitated pathogen invasion, and whether selective mortality from SOD has led to shifts in community composition. Infested and uninfested sites differed significantly in host composition due to both historical trends and disease impacts. A reconstruction of pre‐disease forest composition showed that stands that eventually became infested with the pathogen tended to be more mature with larger stems than stands that remained pathogen‐free, supporting the hypothesis of aerial dispersal by the pathogen across the landscape followed by local understory spread. The change in species composition in uninfested areas was minimal over the study period, while infested stands had large changes in composition, correlated with the loss of tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus), signaling the potential for SOD to dramatically change coastal forests through selective removal of a dominant host. Forest diversity plays an important role in pathogen establishment and spread, and is in turn changed by pathogen impacts.

During 1972–1973, the biomasses of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Stimpson) and S. franciscanus (A. Ag.) were manipulated in 21 experimental cells (each with an area of ≈ 15 m2)constructed on the rocks of the entrance channel breakwater. Biomasses were 0, 100, 1000, and 10,000 g (wet wt) of urchins/m2. Cells were set up with S. purpuratus only, with S. franciscanus only, and with half of the biomass of each species. The rate of change of biomass was positively correlated with original density. Because barriers were not totally effective in restricting movement, the correlation is possibly best interpreted as one of diffusion rather than density-dependent mortality. Difference in the rate of loss between cells with single urchin species and with mixed species may indicate that intraspecific is more intense than interspecific competition. Individual growth rates were determined and step-wise multiple regression analysis was used to examine the relationships between growth increment and initial size, total biomass, interaction of biomass and initial size, and position along the jetty. Only original size and total urchin biomass were significant. The parameter K of the Brody-Bertalanffy growth equation was 0.61 for S. purpuratus and 0.72 for S. franciscanus.The relationship between algal biomass (kg wet wt/0.1 m2) and urchin biomass (kg wet wt/0.25 m2) was: In (algae + 1) = 1.225 In (S.p. + 1)−0.534 In (S.f. + l)+0.009 (position along jetty). Total barrenness would require 42 S. purpuratus or 41 S. franciscanus m2. These values are higher than others in the literature.The density of certain marine invertebrates was found to be correlated with urchin biomass. The hard-shelled sessile molluscs Hinnites multirugosus (Gage) and Serpulorbis squamigerus (Carpenter) were positively correlated, whereas the soft-bodied tunicates Ciona intestinalis (L.) and Styela spp. were negatively correlated.",,,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology,,Elsevier,"0022-0981, 1879-1697",,1977-04,1977,,1977-04,27,1,1-22,Closed,Article,"Ebert, Thomas A.","Ebert, Thomas A.

At high densities, P. antipodarum can outcompete native fauna, disrupt community interactions, and alter ecosystem function, making them a threat to aquatic habitats worldwide. In this paper, we detail the invasion, population dynamics, and secondary production of P. antipodarum at seven sites in the Green River below Flaming Gorge Dam (0.8–49 km below the dam). New Zealand mud snails were first detected in the Green River in 2001. For more than a decade, densities of P. antipodarum in the Green River remained relatively low (< 1200 individuals m−2) at all sites. However, in 2015 densities started to increase dramatically at three sites below the dam, eventually reaching > 19,000 individuals m−2. Annual secondary production estimates of P. antipodarum for the year 2016 ranged from < 0.1 g m−2 yr−1 to 14.2 g m−2 yr−1. Furthermore, in terms of production, P. antipodarum was one of the dominant invertebrate taxa at six of the seven sites. Why densities dramatically increased after 2015 at only three of the seven sites remains unclear. Moreover, it is currently unknown whether populations of P. antipodarum in the Green River will undergo a “bust” period following their dramatic increase in density like populations of P. antipodarum in other river systems. Nevertheless, given the recent increases in densities of P. antipodarum and the relatively high rates of production at several sites, we recommend continued monitoring and suggest that attention be brought to the potential effects of New Zealand mud snails on the structure and function of the Green River ecosystem.",We thank the taxonomists of the National Aquatic Monitoring Center and the numerous field technicians responsible for data collection.

Despite many uncertainties, there is consensus in the fact that global warming already has and will have impact on the temporal and spatial dynamics of insect herbivores. Ectothermic organisms are affected by the changes in environmental conditions directly in dispersal, reproduction, development and mortality, and indirectly through altered plant nutritional quality, resistance and via community interactions. Ambiguous consequences are to be expected depending on the individual host plant and herbivore species, probably involving altered incidence and intensity of pest outbreaks and changes in distributional ranges. Regions that represent northern or upper limits of occurrence, such as the Alps or the boreal zone, are likely to be affected most by an increase in stability and population density of certain pest species, such as defoliating insects or bark beetles. At the same time, temperature increase and drought will render areas of distribution in southern and continental parts of Europe less suitable for heat susceptible species, which will probably not only result in northwards shifts, but range contractions. The review is based on chapters of the “Study on impacts of climate change on European forests and options for adaptation” led by the European Forest Institute (Efi) and on results of the EU project “PROMOTH - Global change and pine processionary moth: a new challenge for integrated pest management”.

Management is hindered because most exploited fish are long‐lived species that utilize a variety of habitats and exhibit high interannual fluctuations in abundance. Effective management requires that we understand how natural and anthropogenic sources of variability in abiotic variables (termed environmental quality [EQ]) affect fish population dynamics. Quantifying the effects of anthropogenic changes in EQ on fish populations has remained elusive and controversial. I illustrate, with examples, six issues related to quantifying EQ effects on fish populations. These examples also serve as demonstrations of how modeling can be used to address these issues. The six issues are: (1) detectability—high interannual variation and interaction effects among climatic variables that affect population dynamics make isolating effects of individual stressors difficult; (2) complex habitat and nonintuitive responses—spatial heterogeneity in habitat can result in population responses that are disproportionate to the changes in EQ; (3) regional predictions—biological realism is often sacrificed unnecessarily when broad spatial scale predictions are needed; (4) community interactions—too little attention is paid to how community‐level interactions can affect population‐based analyses; (5) sublethal effects—sublethal effects are often ignored but can have large effects on population dynamics; and (6) cumulative effects—the combined effect of multiple stressors can be much different than expected from the sum of their individual effects. Examples include a variety of freshwater and marine species. Quantifying EQ effects on fish populations can be improved by considering these issues in analyses, and by taking a true multidisciplinary approach that combines individual‐based modeling and life history theory.","I wish to thank the co‐authors of the examples cited in this paper for their collaboration.

Climatic influences on body size of invertebrates, however, appear highly variable and lack a comparable, generally applicable theoretical framework. We derived predictions for body size–climate relationships for spiders from the literature and tested them using three datasets of variable spatial extent and grain. Location Europe. Methods To distinguish climate from space, we compared clines in body size within three datasets with different degrees of co‐variation between latitude and climate. These datasets were: (1) regional spider faunas from 40 European countries and large islands; (2) local spider assemblages from standardized samples in 32 habitats across Europe; and (3) local spider assemblages from Central European habitats. In the latter dataset climatic conditions were determined more by habitat type than by geographic position, and therefore this dataset provided a non‐spatial gradient of various microclimates. Spider body size was studied in relation to latitude, temperature and water availability. Results In all three datasets the mean body size of spider assemblages increased from cool/moist to warm/dry environments. This increase could be accounted for by turnover from small‐bodied to large‐bodied spider families. Body size–climate relationships within families were inconsistent. Main conclusions Starvation resistance and accelerated maturation can be ruled out as explanations for the body size clines recorded, because they predict the inverse of the observed relationship between spider body size and temperature. The relationship between body size and climate was partly independent of geographic position. Thus, the restriction of large‐bodied spiders to their glacial refugia owing to dispersal limitations can be excluded. Our results are consistent with mechanisms invoking metabolic rate, desiccation resistance and community interactions to predict a decrease in body size from warm and dry to cool and moist conditions.","We thank all partners within the field‐site network of the EU FP 6 integrated project ‘ALARM’ (GOCE‐CT‐2003‐506675) for their contribution to spider sampling (second dataset).

Understanding climate risks to freshwater ecosystems requires combining hydrological and ecological knowledge. While there have been significant advances in ecohydrological approaches when applied within the large array of methods available for undertaking impact assessments, the ecological and hydrological elements are often not well‐integrated. This results in a mismatch in their ability to accommodate the inherent uncertainty in both impacts and responses. We examine published literature that assesses climate change impacts on freshwater ecosystems using both hydrological and ecological models to better understand method choices. We identify four fundamentally distinct modeling approaches used to assess climate change risk. We discuss which approaches are less useful for predicting ecological impacts under climate change, and highlight approaches of comparable complexity that can maximize the utility of dynamic, process‐based modeling while capturing the effects of climate uncertainty and variability. Using an illustrative case study of riparian vegetation health under climate change, we show how the four alternate modeling approaches feature different degrees of information in their outcomes and inferences about future risk. Most current studies that examine climate change risks to freshwater ecosystems use simplified methods or inadequately combine key elements. However, unless the interactions between changing hydrologic variability and ecological responses are explicitly captured in scale‐sensitive modeling methods, the risks of climate change to freshwater ecosystems will likely be substantially misrepresented, with negative consequences for effective management responses. Capturing these interactions requires combining ecological and hydrological methods of comparable complexity. This article is categorized under: Climate, Ecology, and Conservation > Modeling Species and Community Interactions Combinations of alternate modeling methods lead to different kinds of outcomes when assessing climate change risk. Stochastic dynamic approaches which can project sequential ecological outcomes and accommodate climate variability are underrepresented in the literature.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This study was funded by the Australian Research Council (ARC Linkage Project LP170100598), Australian Commonwealth Government under a Research Training Program Scholarship, and several partner agencies including the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning; the Victorian Environmental Water Holder and the Bureau of Meteorology.

304,pub.1040990222,10.1002/ecm.1222,,,,"Habitat, predators, and hosts regulate disease in Daphnia through direct and indirect pathways","Community ecology can link habitat to disease via interactions among habitat, focal hosts, other hosts, their parasites, and predators. However, complicated food web interactions (i.e., trophic interactions among predators and their impacts on host density and diversity) often obscure the important pathways regulating disease. Here, we disentangle community drivers in a case study of planktonic disease, using a two‐step approach. In step one, we tested univariate field patterns linking community interactions directly to two disease metrics. Density of focal hosts (Daphnia dentifera) was related to density but not prevalence of fungal (Metschnikowia bicuspidata) infections. Both disease metrics appeared to be driven by selective predators that cull infected hosts (fish, e.g., Lepomis macrochirus), sloppy predators that spread parasites while feeding (midges, Chaoborus punctipennis), and spore predators that reduce contact between focal hosts and parasites (other zooplankton, especially small‐bodied Ceriodaphnia sp.). Host diversity also negatively correlated with disease, suggesting a dilution effect. However, several of these univariate patterns were initially misleading, due to confounding ecological links among habitat, predators, host density, and host diversity. In step two, path models uncovered and explained these misleading patterns, and grounded them in habitat structure (refuge size). First, rather than directly reducing infection prevalence, fish predation drove disease indirectly through changes in density of midges and frequency of small spore predators (which became more frequent in lakes with small refuges). Second, small spore predators drove the two disease metrics through fundamentally different pathways: they directly reduced infection prevalence, but indirectly reduced density of infected hosts by lowering density of focal hosts (likely via competition). Third, the univariate diversity–disease pattern (signaling a dilution effect) merely reflected the confounding direct effects of these small spore predators. Diversity per se had no effect on disease, after accounting for the links between small spore predators, diversity, and infection prevalence. In turn, these small spore predators were regulated by both size‐selective fish predation and refuge size. Thus, path models not only explain each of these surprising results, but also trace their origins back to habitat structure.","K. Boatman assisted with 2009 and 2010 field sampling. A.

303,pub.1137102284,10.1111/fwb.13715,,,,Characteristics and consequences of a disease outbreak in aquatic insects,"Disease can be a powerful driver of population and community dynamics, as well as evolutionary processes. Disease is also emerging at increasing rates, resulting in massive impacts on populations, communities, and ecosystems. However, assessing these impacts requires foundational knowledge of disease agents and hosts, which is often lacking, particularly in aquatic insects. We describe a recent disease outbreak in caddisflies, suggesting potential consequences for population and community dynamics of the host. We use a series of complementary studies to develop a cohesive foundation of information about this disease, including identification using genomic methods, observational prevalence studies, laboratory experiments to establish transmissibility and fitness consequences, and laboratory and field investigations to infer transmission mechanisms. We identified the infection as being caused by the oomycete Saprolegnia—the first time this parasite has been noted in insect eggs. Prevalence surveys found high prevalence (up to 36%) with variation across space, time, and host species. We demonstrated increasing egg mortality with increasing infection within an egg mass (every 10% increase in infection rate doubles odds of mortality), thereby confirming disease. We established transmissibility and show that transmission occurs through both direct contact with infected egg masses and from background sources, which probably interact to create complex patterns of disease. Taken together, our findings show that conditions necessary for population and community consequences are present. Specifically, increased mortality rates almost certainly occurred during the outbreak, yielding lower larval numbers and potentially altering community interactions. Transmission by contact between egg masses combined with observed species‐specific prevalence suggest shifts in the relative performance of different species because of interactions between host and parasite life histories. Outside extreme examples such as chytrid fungus, disease has traditionally received less interest than resource competition or predation in community ecology, although disease ecology is advancing rapidly. One major hurdle is a lack of foundational knowledge characterising disease processes in natural communities, particularly in aquatic insects. Our findings highlight the importance of investigating diseases in insect eggs and provide the foundation for further investigations of how these processes play out at the population and community scale.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We would like to thank Barbara Downes, Wim Bovill, Peter Chesson, and Jill Lancaster for valuable advice on the field studies and comments on the manuscript.

Samples were taken along a distance-depositional gradient from the river mouth to the open sea at eight stations, at times of different precipitation regime from August 2000 to May 2001. The physical variables, such as transparency and median grain size, generally increased seawards, and parallelled the depositional gradient as opposed to measures of food inputs and hydrodynamic regime. High environmental heterogeneity was observed during peak precipitation. The total number of species increased seawards and from August (122 species) to May (170 species). Maximum abundance also increased from August (4953 m−2) to May (10,220 individuals m−2), irrespective of distance from river mouth. Species belonging to different functional groups, as to recolonization, feeding, motility and substrate preferences, coexisted at all times indicating high functional diversity. Non-parametric multivariate regression showed that at times of low, rising and falling precipitation 78–81% of community variation was explained by environmental variables, indicating that macrofauna distribution and species composition respond to food inputs and sediment characteristics. During peak land runoff the community–environment relationship weakened (57% of the variability explained). The diversity of functional traits of the most abundant species indicates that the macrofauna community can absorb the impact of increased turbidity, sedimentation and current-driven dispersion. The study offers baseline information for the integrated coastal zone management in microtidal areas with high land runoff under Mediterranean-type climate conditions. During peak land runoff the community–environment relationship weakened (57% of the variability explained) whilst species distribution ranges increased. The study shows that the functional diversity in the study area prior to high discharge period enable macrofauna community to absorb the impact of increased turbidity, sedimentation and current-driven dispersion. The study offers baseline information for the impact of high land runoff in microtidal areas under Mediterranean-type climate conditions.","This research was supported by the doctoral special funding of the University of Crete and received supplementary funding by the project of the Hellenic Ministry of the Environment, Physical Planning and Public Works for a baseline study in view of the construction of Maliakos Gulf underwater junction.",,Estuarine Coastal and Shelf Science,,Elsevier,"0272-7714, 1096-0015",,2013-11,2013,,2013-11,132,,34-44,Closed,Article,"Akoumianaki, Ioanna; Papaspyrou, Sokratis; Kormas, Konstantinos Ar.; Nicolaidou, Artemis","Akoumianaki, Ioanna (Institute of Oceanography, Hellenic Centre for Marine Research, Anavissos 19013, Attiki, Greece); Papaspyrou, Sokratis (Department of Biology, University of Athens, Panepistimiopolis 15784, Athens, Greece); Kormas, Konstantinos Ar.

Here, we demonstrate the use of a general equilibrium ecosystem model (GEEM) to investigate ecological conditions surrounding a population eruption of the house mouse (Mus musculus) in Kern County, California in the 1920s, arguably the most dramatic mammalian population eruption reported for North America. Our application of GEEM to this ecosystem allowed us to evaluate the plausibility of reported population densities of house mice that were extreme, even in comparison with values for the same species introduced in Australia, and to examine alternative hypothetical community interactions and their effects on populations. The modeled ecosystem included vegetation, native small rodents and introduced house mice as herbivores, and mammalian predators. Individual plants and animals behaved as net energy optimizers, with net energy directed to reproduction. Optimizing predators determined the biomass taken from prey, and prey, through feeding choices, determined their vulnerability to predators. Model inputs incorporated the competitive superiority of house mice to native small rodents, the time of arrival of house mice in the area, and the timing and intensity of predator removal. Without an invasion of house mice, human removal of predators was predicted to minimally affect native small rodents. Without human removal of predators, invading house mouse populations were predicted to attain high, oscillating densities by the 1920s that stabilized at lower densities by the 1930s, with native small rodents persisting in the area. With near-complete human removal of predators and with house mice present, native small rodents were predicted to go nearly extinct, and house mice to attain densities similar to those reported. The predicted lag between the introduction and eruption of house mice approximated reported values. Predation on native and introduced rodents was predicted to allow both rodent groups to coexist, whereas near-complete removal of predators caused native small rodents to approach extinction during the house mouse eruption, consistent with empirical studies. GEEM appears to be a useful tool for reconstructing past ecosystem conditions and trophic interactions.","This research was supported in part by the Program of Research on the Economics of Invasive Species Management (PREISM), Economic Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, under Cooperative Agreement 43-3AEM-3-80080.

Plant-Soil Feedbacks of Maize Companion Cropping Increase Chemical Plant Defenses Against Herbivores,"Plants can alter nutritional availability, structure, and chemistry of the soil they grow in. These soil changes can positively or negatively influence the growth and metabolism of other plants that co-occur or grow later in the conditioned soil. Plant-soil feedbacks could affect community interactions and dynamics but also be applied in sustainable agriculture to promote plant growth and resistance to pests. In this study, we use a maize companion cropping system, commonly known as “push-pull,” as a model to investigate soil-mediated effects of functional biodiversity, on maize plant growth, and resistance against insect herbivores. We grew maize in soils collected from push-pull (polyculture) and non-push-pull (monoculture) fields. We evaluated maize performance by measuring plant growth, as well as resistance traits (herbivore oviposition and larval feeding, production of defense-related volatile, and non-volatile secondary defense metabolites). Maize plants grown in soil conditioned by push-pull companion cropping had a higher growth rate compared to those grown in soil from non-push-pull monoculture fields. In addition, soil from push-pull fields induced a constitutively higher and qualitatively different emission of volatile organic compounds than soil from non-push-pull fields. Moreover, secondary defense metabolites such as 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (DIMBOA), were produced in larger quantities in plants grown in soil from push-pull fields compared to those from monoculture fields. These soil-mediated alterations in plant secondary metabolism were associated with reduced herbivory by larvae of the stemboring pest Chilo partelllus. This study provides novel evidence that plant-soil feedbacks can affect plant metabolism, growth, and resistance to pests. The observed soil-mediated effects on maize plant secondary metabolism can be viewed as emergent properties of plant community composition as well as a potent mechanism of associational resistance. In addition, these soil-conditioning effects provide a novel pest control mechanism of push-pull companion cropping.","We are grateful to smallholder farmers in Lake Victoria basin, Kenya for allowing us to collect soil from their farms.

303,pub.1126654136,10.1111/fwb.13511,,,,Seasonal variation in the strength of interference competition among headwater stream predators,"Vertebrate communities in headwater streams are assumed to be regulated through competitive and predatory interactions. Although documented predation is rare, studies regularly report competitive dominance by fish that, as larger competitors reliant on aquatic habitat, exclude semi‐aquatic salamanders to marginal stream habitat. However, it is unclear whether fish interact with stream‐breeding salamanders through indirect effects such as competition for resources (e.g. food or cover) or fear (i.e. threat of predation) nor is it known whether these interactions are consistent through time. This study used a novel caging approach to determine if competitive outcomes between a headwater fish and salamanders were regulated primarily through resource depletion (exploitative competition) or behavioural avoidance (interference competition). We paired banded sculpin (Cottus carolinae) and larval red salamanders (Pseudotriton ruber) of similar body size in independent flow through mesocosms with intra‐ and inter‐specific pairs allowed to interact physically or non‐physically. The experiment was repeated in the autumn and in the spring when stream salamander larvae begin to transform into terrestrial juveniles. Banded sculpin negatively influenced growth of red salamanders regardless of whether they were allowed to physically interact, suggesting interference competition and behavioural avoidance. This asymmetrical effect was strongest in the spring when salamanders underwent metamorphosis at higher rates in the presence of fish. However, in the autumn, the effects were more balanced between the two species with salamanders impacting fish through exploitative competition. By studying the temporal relationships between two competitors and using a caging method novel to competition studies, we established that the outcomes of competition are dependent on season and may vary in type relative to the timing of life‐history events. For this community, these results suggest that outcomes of competition are highly dependent on season and could indicate a biotic mechanism maintaining headwater salamander distributions through source–sink dynamics. Our results also suggest that, in this species interaction, it may be unwarranted to assume that the outcomes of competition at one time represent the complex relationships regulating community interactions.","We thank Mary Lou Hoffacker, Georgie Huber, Ansley Murphy, and Meredith Sackett for assistance with animal collection, Katie Weigel for work on an early draft of this manuscript, and Kevin Fouts for assistance with experimental set‐up.

303,pub.1007348828,10.1111/1365-2435.12379,,,,Abiotic constraints on the activity of tropical lizards,"Many tropical ectotherms are considered vulnerable to anthropogenic climate change because they have evolved to become thermal specialists. Indeed, several recent studies have suggested that even small increases in mean operative temperature may lead to a reduction in activity and the subsequent extinction of populations. Within the tropics, lizards are considered particularly vulnerable due to the potential for climate change to directly impact physiology and alter community interactions. However, models usually focus on the effects of mean operative temperature at the expense of other climate variables that may also affect lizard physiology. We used daily variation in operative temperature, humidity and wind speed to examine how changes in climate influence activity in two species of lizards from the island of Cayo Menor, Honduras. Anolis lemurinus is a forest species, whereas A. allisoni is an open‐habitat species. We conducted daily surveys for active lizards in habitat typical to each species, while simultaneously measuring operative thermal environments with physical models. The effects of the thermal environment were considered in the context of the thermal sensitivity of locomotor performance for each species and compared with the effects of the hydric (humidity) and convective (wind) environments. When all surveys were combined into a single analysis, the activity of the forest species Anolis lemurinus was positively correlated with wind speed, the spatial heterogeneity of operative temperature, and the mismatch between mean operative temperature and the optimal temperature for sprint performance. Mean operative temperature did significantly affect Anolis lemurinus activity, but only when it was above their thermal optimum. Activity of the open‐habitat species A. allisoni was negatively correlated with wind speed, but was not related to any other climate variable. Whereas the mismatch between mean operative temperature and the thermal optimum for performance predicted the activity level of the forest species in ways partially consistent with its use in models for the response of lizards to climate change, the effects of the abiotic environment were habitat dependent. Our results suggest that successfully predicting the biological impacts of climate change will require holistic models that account for more than changes in mean temperature alone.

303,pub.1138087518,10.1111/jvs.13043,,,,Is plant reproductive efficiency expressed on a continuum of facilitation and competition?,"Competition and facilitation form a continuum of interactions between plants from intensely negative to intensely positive. Competition has long been understood to be a major selective force driving the expression of adaptive strategies in plants. However, we remain uncertain if facilitation plays a similar role. In previous studies, the relative allocation to reproduction across plant species increases with increasing competition intensity, and this observation is generally consistent with life history theory (rather than traditional plant strategy theory). However, is facilitation also an important force in shaping adaptive strategies in plants? We surveyed the literature for plant facilitation studies that included measures of plant performance (e.g. vegetative biomass, height) and reproduction (e.g. reproductive biomass, seed number). We tested for a relationship between relative reproductive efficiency (the allocation to reproduction in the presence of neighbours relative to the allocation of reproduction in the absence of neighbours), and facilitation interaction intensity (i.e. the increase in plant performance due to the presence of neighbours). We also compared this relationship to the previously published relationship between reproductive efficiency and competition intensity to test for a continuum of strategies on an axis of plant–plant interactions from intensely positive (facilitation) to intensely negative (competition). The overall relationship between facilitation intensity and the relative reproductive efficiency is a common negative relationship for both annual and perennial life histories. We found a highly significant negative relationship across the competition–facilitation continuum, with reproductive efficiency in the presence of neighbouring vegetation high under intense competition and low under intense facilitation. Plant reproductive strategies are expressed on a continuum of interactions from facilitation to competition. This continuum of interactions will be important in understanding how interactions between plants drive the evolution of adaptive strategies and control coexistence and diversity in plant communities. Interactions between plants can be intensely negative (competition) through to intensely positive (facilitation). While competition is predicted to be important in the evolution of plant strategies, the potential role of facilitation in the expression and evolution of adaptive strategies is poorly understood. We demonstrate that plant reproductive strategies are expressed on a continuum of competitive to facilitative plant interactions.","We thank Clara Pang for help with collecting the data, and Joe Atkinson for assistance with data analysis.

303,pub.1112987442,10.1111/1365-2435.13335,,,,Do scavengers prevent or promote disease transmission? The effect of invertebrate scavenging on Ranavirus transmission,"Host–parasite interactions are shaped by the broader web of community interactions, from interspecific competition to predator–prey dynamics. Heterospecific scavengers might also affect parasite transmission from infectious carcasses, which can be an important source of infections for some wildlife diseases. A robust scavenger community can quickly remove carcasses and tissue and thus prevent secondary transmission by necrophagy or contact with infectious carcasses. Alternatively, by spreading infectious particles and tissues throughout the environment, scavengers may increase rates of casual contact with pathogens and thus overall transmission. However, there has been little empirical consideration of the contrasting roles that scavengers might play in infectious disease dynamics. We carried out a series of studies to determine the efficiency with which scavenging invertebrates remove carcasses of Long‐toed Salamander (Ambystoma macrodactylum) larvae and their role in the transmission of frog virus 3 (Genus: Ranavirus, Family: Iridoviridae) from carcasses. We then estimated the functional response of one efficient invertebrate scavenger (Family: Dytiscidae) to increasing carcass densities in field conditions in order to determine the capacity of scavenging invertebrates to consume large amounts of carcass tissue, as may be present at high prevalence sites. We found that removal of infectious carcasses by scavengers strongly reduced transmission to naïve larvae. Scavengers were as effective at reducing transmission from a carcass as a physical barrier preventing contact with the carcass. There was little evidence that scavenging released sufficient infectious tissues into the water column to rival direct contact as a route of infection. Moreover, while scavenging rates saturated at increasing carcass densities, consistent with a type II functional response, there were sufficient densities of dytiscid larvae, not to mention other scavenging invertebrates, in a surveyed pond to theoretically prevent transmission from carcasses. Our results suggest that at least in systems in which conspecific necrophagy is common, the scavenger community can play an important role in reducing transmission.

303,pub.1019632558,10.1890/13-0160.1,,,,Consequences of climate change for biotic disturbances in North American forests,"About one‐third of North America is forested. These forests are of incalculable value to human society in terms of harvested resources and ecosystem services and are sensitive to disturbance regimes. Epidemics of forest insects and diseases are the dominant sources of disturbance to North American forests. Here we review current understanding of climatic effects on the abundance of forest insects and diseases in North America, and of the ecological and socioeconomic impacts of biotic disturbances. We identified 27 insects (6 nonindigenous) and 22 diseases (9 nonindigenous) that are notable agents of disturbance in North American forests. The distribution and abundance of forest insects and pathogens respond rapidly to climatic variation due to their physiological sensitivity to temperature, high mobility, short generation times, and high reproductive potential. Additionally, climate affects tree defenses, tree tolerance, and community interactions involving enemies, competitors, and mutualists of insects and diseases. Recent research affirms the importance of milder winters, warmer growing seasons, and changes in moisture availability to the occurrence of biotic disturbances. Predictions from the first U.S. National Climate Assessment of expansions in forest disturbances from climate change have been upheld, in some cases more rapidly and dramatically than expected. Clear examples are offered by recent epidemics of spruce beetles in Alaska, mountain pine beetle in high‐elevation five‐needle pine forests of the Rocky Mountains, and southern pine beetle in the New Jersey Pinelands. Pathogens are less studied with respect to climate, but some are facilitated by warmer and wetter summer conditions. Changes in biotic disturbances have broad consequences for forest ecosystems and the services they provide to society. Climatic effects on forest insect and disease outbreaks may foster further changes in climate by influencing the exchange of carbon, water, and energy between forests and the atmosphere. Climate‐induced changes in forest productivity and disturbance create opportunities as well as vulnerabilities (e.g., increases in productivity in many areas, and probably decreases in disturbance risks in some areas). There is a critical need to better understand and predict the interactions among climate, forest productivity, forest disturbance, and the socioeconomic relations between forests and people.","This document was conceived as a part of the third National Climate Assessment evaluating the effects of climatic change on forest ecosystems and forest resources in the United States.

Here we investigated the influence of competition and predation on space and resource use via continuous video transect observations – a tool that has not previously been employed for this purpose. This study therefore also evaluates video data as a pragmatic tool to study community interactions in the deep sea. Observations were compiled from 15 video transects spanning five submarine canyons in the Bay of Biscay, France. Substrate choice, positioning on the coral, echinoid aggregate size, and the presence/absence of predators (e.g. fish and decapods) as well as competitors (both inter‐ and intra‐specific) were recorded. Two dominant co‐existing echinoid taxa, echinothurids and Cidaris cidaris (3188 total observations), were observed in the study. For the echinothurids, no significant trends were detected in the inter‐ and intra‐specific competition data. For Cidaris cidaris, significant shifts in substrate use were correlated to the presence of inter‐specific competitors (echinothurids), whereby an increase in dead coral substrate usage was observed. Highly significant patterns were detected amongst echinoids near fish and decapod predators. A shift to the base of the coral infra‐structure was correlated to the presence of fish, and fewer individuals were observed in the open areas of the reef and a greater number were found in the mid and top sections of the coral when in the presence of decapods. Aggregates formed irrespective of the presence of predators. Aggregations are likely to form for feeding and reproduction rather than for defensive purposes; and migration along the coral infra‐structure may be a predator‐driven behaviour as echinoids seek refuge from predators. Predation risk might play a stronger – or more detectable – role in structuring echinoid space and resource use in deep‐sea coral habitats. In addition, the study successfully detected patterns in the video data thereby demonstrating its potential usefulness for similar ecological studies on other deep‐dwelling megabenthos.","We thank the pilots of ROV Victor 6000, and the captain and crew of RV Pourquoi Pas? for their support in sea‐going operations.

In particular, regularly oscillating rodent populations in Scandinavia have been subject of discussions among theoretically and empirically working ecologists for many decades. Spatial and temporal restrictions in empirical work led to various attempts to model these dynamics to understand large scale effects resulting from complex interactions in variable cause-effect networks of the numerous involved system components.The presented individual-based model for the first time described small rodent communities as a set of interacting autonomously acting agents with a detailed life history and behavioural repertoire in a food-web setup composed of three trophic levels (rodents, rodents food and predators). It thus allowed to integrate all relevant factors accounting for the dynamics of rodents which acted in a simulated environment containing the spatial arrangement of habitats and seasonal changing conditions. Due to the representation with interacting entities, the dynamics on higher levels resulted in a self-organisation process as emergent properties. This differentiation between the focal and the operational level allowed to investigate processes interacting between different integration levels and to adapt the model to different scenarios easily as well as to specify it for a large range of rodents species.Simulations have been executed for two different scenarios. The Bornhöved scenario simulating the situation of a Northern German rodent community in a beech forest represented bottom-up effects of mast events on population dynamics. The Scandinavian scenario which depicted the most important actors of these oscillating rodent communities, gave new insights into the processes causing the sudden decline of rodent populations. Both, lack of resources and predation, contributed to about 90% of mortality, but no pattern could be found when relating either cause with the properties of the respective cycle. Bottom up and top down control vary unpredictably and chaotically in the model. These results may explain considerable parts of contradicting empirical findings.",,,Ecological Modelling,,Elsevier,"0304-3800, 1872-7026",,2005-09,2005,,2005-09,186,4,427-446,Closed,Article,"Reuter, Hauke","Reuter, Hauke (Centre for Environmental Research and Technology (UFT), Department of General and Theoretical Ecology, University of Bremen, P.O.

303,pub.1010229732,10.1898/nwn08-56.1,,,,"Predatory Leeches (Hirudinida) May Contribute to Amphibian Declines in the Lassen Region, California","Researchers have documented precipitous declines in Cascades Frog (Rana cascadae) populations in the southern portion of the species' range, in the Lassen region of California. Reasons for the declines, however, have not been elucidated. In addition to common, widespread causes, an understanding of local community interactions may be necessary to fully understand proximal causes of the declines. Based on existing literature and observations made during extensive aquatic surveys throughout the range of R. cascadae in California, we propose that a proliferation of freshwater leeches (subclass Hirudinida) in the Lassen region may be adversely affecting R. cascadae populations. Leeches may affect R. cascadae survival or fecundity directly by preying on egg and hatchling life stages, and indirectly by contributing to the spread of pathogens and secondary parasites. In 2007, we conducted focused surveys at known or historic R. cascadae breeding sites to document co-occurrences of R. cascadae and leeches, determine if leeches were preying on or parasitizing eggs or hatchlings of R. cascadae, and identify the leech species to establish whether or not they were native to the region. We found R. cascade at 4 of 21 sites surveyed and freshwater leeches at 9 sites, including all sites with R. cascadae. In 2007 and 2008, the predatory leech Haemopis marmorata frequented R. cascadae egg masses, was observed probing or tearing at eggs on 24 occasions, and was 10 times more common in 1-m2 plots centered on egg masses than in similar plots without egg masses. Six species of leech were identified from the Lassen region, only 3 of which have been documented from the region prior to this study. Given our documentation of a diverse freshwater leech fauna in direct association with a precipitously declining species, we believe a better understanding of the biology and ecology of this poorly studied taxon is needed, in addition to studies of the effects of freshwater leeches on survival and recruitment of co-occurring amphibians.","Funding for this investigation was provided by USDA Forest Service Region 5.

303,pub.1001208438,10.1111/j.1365-2435.2012.02049.x,,,,The effects of invasion on parasite dynamics and communities,"Invasions can impact on parasite communities through both the introduction of exotic parasite species and effects of invading hosts on native parasite dynamics. However, our understanding of the factors that influence the invasive process and mediate impacts on native hosts and parasites is limited. Using models of host–parasite dynamics as a framework, we explore how both the probability of spread for an exotic parasite and impacts of introduced species on native parasite dynamics depend on key parameters related to rates of encounter, transmission, mortality and recovery. We examine how invasions may interact with the diverse range of underlying biological mechanisms that can affect these rates. We specifically highlight the potential role of interactions between parasites, which has largely been ignored. For introduced parasites, high abundance of competent hosts and vectors within native communities can greatly facilitate spread. Introduced host species can cause amplification or dilution effects for native parasite dynamics, with the direction and magnitude of the effect determined by how the invasion influences the competency and abundance or relative abundance of the host community (community capacity). Invasions by exotic parasites and changes to endemic parasite dynamics following invasions may reflect numerical and functional processes in multihost single‐parasite systems (e.g. influence of host and vector community structure on encounter rates). However, as co‐infection can influence factors such as susceptibility and infection length, effects may also be mediated by within‐host interactions between parasites. The ultimate effect of an invasion will depend on the community‐wide summed direct and indirect impacts. Future studies should aim to further elucidate the key processes influencing disease dynamics in multihost (and multivector) communities, thereby informing predictions of how invasive host and parasite species and changes in biodiversity will influence disease risk. Theoretical studies should incorporate host interspecific competition and relax assumptions regarding the relationship between intra‐ and interspecific contact rates and density. Empirical and experimental studies should not only quantify the relative importance of host (and vector) density and diversity, but also consider other community interactions such as those between parasites.

While the importance of wood decay for the global carbon balance is widely recognized, surprisingly little is known about its long‐term dynamics and its abiotic and biotic drivers. Progress in this field is hindered by the long time‐scales inherent to the low decay rates of wood and the lack of short‐term methods to assess long‐term decomposition dynamics in standardized field conditions. 2. Here, we present such a method, which relies on the sampling and short‐term incubation of wood from several decay stages covering the entire decay process. Together these short‐term decay steps are used to model and discriminate between three potential decay dynamics (linear, exponential and sigmoid) using an iterative optimization procedure. We applied this method to analyse long‐term wood decay of six subarctic tree species (six stems and two roots) and test the hypotheses that (i) different wood species follow distinct decay dynamics and (ii) interspecific variation in wood traits controls variation in wood decay rates in a standardized environment. 3. We found interspecific variation in long‐term wood decay dynamics: decay of Alnus and Salix stems was best described by exponential models, whereas decay of Sorbus stems and Betula and Pinus roots was best fitted by linear models and Betula, Pinus and Populus stems each displayed a sigmoid decay dynamics (up to 5‐year initial lag phase). A six‐fold variation was observed between the decomposition half‐lives of all eight wood types, from 6.8 years (6.1–7.5, 95% C.I.) for Alnus stems to 41.3 years (34.5–51.8) for Pinus roots. Initial wood traits such as pH (R2 = 0.92), dry matter content (R2 = 0.79) and lignin (R2 = 0.73) were good predictors of long‐term wood decay rates. 4. Synthesis. Our findings suggest changing decay dynamics across wood species and types that are likely to arise from changing underlying wood decay processes (i.e. varying wood functional traits/decomposer community interactions). Our new method, which combines advantages of direct observations and the chronosequence approach, allows reliable comparisons of species contributions to long‐term wood decay rates and provides future opportunities to experimentally disentangle intrinsic and external abiotic and biotic drivers of long‐term wood decay processes.",Our acknowledgments go to the Abisko Scientific Research Station (ANS) for hosting this experiment.

However, reconciling variability of KC over space and time to produce robust algorithms remains challenging, given the large number of factors that influence KC. We have previously shown that light appears to be a proximal driver of Kc in several ocean regions and we therefore examined whether and how light similarly regulated KC variability in the Arctic Ocean, during a summer cruise in 2016. Sampling transited ice-free and ice-covered waters, with temperature, salinity and Chl-a concentrations all higher for the ice-free than ice covered surface waters. Micro- and pico-phytoplankton generally dominated the ice-free and ice-covered waters, respectively. Values of KC, determined from parallel measures of daily integrated electron transport rates and 14C-uptake, were overall lower for the ice-covered vs. ice-free stations. As in our previous studies, KC was strongly linearly correlated to daily PAR (r = 0.68, n = 46, p < 0.001) and this relationship could be further improved (r = 0.84, n = 46, p < 0.001) by separating samples into ice-free (micro-phytoplankton dominated) vs. ice-covered (Nano- and Pico-phytoplankton dominated water. We subsequently contrasted the PAR-KC relationship form the Arctic waters with the previous relationships from the Ariake Bay and East China Sea and revealed that these various PAR-KC relationships can be systematically explained across regions by phytoplankton community size structures. Specifically, the value of the linear slope describing PAR-KC decreases as water bodies have an increasing fraction of larger phytoplankton. We propose that this synoptic trend reflects how phytoplankton community structure integrates past and immediate environmental histories and hence may be a better broad-scale predictor of KC than specific environmental factors such as temperature and nutrients. We provide a novel algorithm that may enable broad-scale retrieval of CO2 uptake from FRRf with knowledge of light and phytoplankton community size information.","We would like to thank the captain, officers and crew of the R/V Chinare for their admirable assistance during onboard sampling and measurements.

Among them, the two most frequently studied are the neutral role of species abundances in determining encounter probability and the deterministic role of species identity (traits and evolutionary history) in determining the compatibility of interacting species. Nevertheless, the occurrence of pairwise interactions also depends on the spatio-temporal context imposed by the ecological neighborhood (i.e., the indirect effect of other local species sharing traits and interaction potential with the focal ones). Although a few studies have begun to examine neighborhood effects on community interactions, these have not incorporated neighborhood structure as a complementary driver of pairwise interactions within an integrative approach. Here we describe the spatial structure of pairwise interactions between three fleshy-fruited tree species and six frugivorous thrush species within the same locality of the Cantabrian Range (Iberian Peninsula). Using a spatio-temporally fine-grained dataset sampled during 3 years, we aimed to detect spatial patterns of interactions and to evaluate their concordance across years. We also evaluated the simultaneous roles played by species abundance, species identity and the ecological neighborhood in determining the pairwise interaction frequencies based on fruit removal. Our results showed that the abundances of fruit and bird species involved in plant-frugivore interactions, and the spatial patterns of these interactions, varied among years, and this was mainly due to different fruiting landscapes responding to masting events of distinct plant species. Despite high interannual differences in species abundances and pairwise interaction frequencies, the main mechanisms underpinning the occurrence of pairwise interactions remained constant. Most of the variability in pairwise interactions was always explained by interacting fruit and bird species' abundances. Ecological neighborhood, characterized as the net quantity of forest cover, heterospecific fruit crops, and heterospecific bird abundances in the immediate surroundings, also affected pairwise interaction frequency through its indirect effects on the abundance of interacting bird species. Our results highlight the prevalence of neutral forces in highly generalized plant-frugivore assemblages as well as the influence of indirect interactions (competition and/or facilitation with other local species) as another important driver to consider when predicting pairwise interactions.","We thank J.

In Lake Superior, the ongoing restoration of the native lake trout populations is now regarded as one of the major success stories in fisheries management. However, populations of the deepwater morphotype (siscowet lake trout) have increased much more substantially than those of the nearshore morphotype (lean lake trout), and the ecosystem now contains an assemblage of exotic species such as sea lamprey, rainbow smelt, and Pacific salmon (chinook, coho, and steelhead). Those species play an important role in defining the constraints and opportunities for ecosystem management. We combined an equilibrium mass balance model (Ecopath) with a dynamic food web model (Ecosim) to evaluate the ecological consequences of future alternative management strategies and the interaction of two different sets of life history characteristics for fishes at the top of the food web. Relatively rapid turnover rates occur among the exotic forage fish, rainbow smelt, and its primary predators, exotic Pacific salmonids. Slower turnover rates occur among the native lake trout and burbot and their primary prey—lake herring, smelt, deepwater cisco, and sculpins. The abundance of forage fish is a key constraint for all salmonids in Lake Superior. Smelt and Mysis play a prominent role in sustaining the current trophic structure. Competition between the native lake trout and the exotic salmonids is asymmetric. Reductions in the salmon population yield only a modest benefit for the stocks of lake trout, whereas increased fishing of lake trout produces substantial potential increases in the yields of Pacific salmon to recreational fisheries. The deepwater or siscowet morphotype of lake trout has become very abundant. Although it plays a major role in the structure of the food web it offers little potential for the restoration of a valuable commercial or recreational fishery. Even if a combination of strong management actions is implemented, the populations of lean (nearshore) lake trout cannot be restored to pre-fishery and pre-lamprey levels. Thus, management strategy must accept the ecological constraints due in part to the presence of exotics and choose alternatives that sustain public interest in the resources while continuing the gradual progress toward restoration.",,,Ecosystems,,Springer Nature,"1432-9840, 1435-0629",,2000-11,2000,2014-03-04,2000-11,3,6,545-560,Closed,Article,"Kitchell, James F.; Cox, Sean P.; Harvey, Chris J.; Johnson, Timothy B.; Mason, Doran M.; Schoen, Kurt K.; Aydin, Kerim; Bronte, Charles; Ebener, Mark; Hansen, Michael; Hoff, Michael; Schram, Steve; Schreiner, Don; Walters, Carl J.","Kitchell, James F.

For example, network techniques have been used to study community interactions (i.e., food-webs, mutualisms), gene flow across landscapes, and the sociality of individuals in populations. The work presented here uses a bibliographic and network approach to (1) document the rise of Network Ecology, (2) identify the diversity of topics addressed in the field, and (3) map the structure of scientific collaboration among contributing scientists. Our aim is to provide a broad overview of this emergent field that highlights its diversity and to provide a foundation for future advances. To do this, we searched the ISI Web of Science database for ecology publications between 1900 and 2012 using the search terms for research areas of Environmental Sciences & Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and the topic ecology. From these records we identified the Network Ecology publications using the topic terms network, graph theory, and web, while controlling for the usage of misleading phrases. The resulting corpus entailed 29,513 publications between 1936 and 2012. We found that Network Ecology spans across more than 1500 sources with core ecological journals being among the top 20 most frequent outlets. We document the rapid rise in Network Ecology publications per year reaching a magnitude of over 5% of the ecological publications in 2012. Drawing topical information from the publication record content (titles, abstracts, keywords) and collaboration information from author listing, our analysis highlights the diversity and clustering of topics addressed within Network Ecology. The largest connected component of the topic network contained 73% of the corpus, and exhibited strong clustering (clustering coefficient 0.93). The co-authorship network revealed that while network ecologists are generally collaborative, the field is deeply fragmented into topic and co-author cliques. The largest component of the co-author network comprised 46% of the authors and contained 149 distinct clusters. We suggest ways to build on the collaborative spirit and reduce the field fragmentation so as to improve the development and spread of ideas. We conclude that Network Ecology will likely continue to grow because the forces driving its increase are likely to persist.","This work was initially presented at the “Systems Ecology: A Network Perspective and Retrospective” symposium in honor of Dr. Bernard C.

292,pub.1145363528,10.1002/ecm.1509,,,,Experimental repatriation of snowshoe hares along a southern range boundary reveals historical community interactions,"Climate change is altering interspecific interactions globally, yet community‐level responses are difficult to predict due to both the direct and indirect effects of changing abiotic and biotic conditions. Snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) are particularly vulnerable to decreasing snow cover and resultant camouflage mismatch. This species shares a suite of predators with alternative prey species including porcupines (Erethizon dorsatum) and ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus), and all three species historically exhibited synchronized population dynamics. Recently, the community has become partially disassembled, notably with the loss of snowshoe hares and associated enemy‐mediated indirect interactions resulting from declining snow duration. Specifically, we hypothesized that the extirpation of hares in the early 1990s indirectly increased predation pressure on ruffed grouse and porcupines. To test our hypothesis, we experimentally translocated 96 snowshoe hares to a site within a regional ecotone between northern and southern forests where snowshoe hares were recently extirpated and monitored community members before, during, and after translocation. Ruffed grouse were only loosely associated with the biotic interactions that linked porcupines and snowshoe hares, likely due to predation occurring from avian predators and strong negative direct effects of declining winter snow depths. In contrast, predation of neonate porcupines was virtually non‐existent following repatriation, compared with periods without hares. This abrupt attenuation of predation did not increase overall survival due to increased non‐predation mortality from cold, early spring weather. Porcupines directly benefited from warming winters: decreased snow cover increased adult survival and warmer temperatures around parturition increased maternal condition and reduced non‐predation causes of mortality for neonates. Our experimental manipulation suggests that enemy‐mediated indirect interactions were likely to be important features of this community; however, climate change has disrupted these interactions, resulting in extirpation of a central prey species (snowshoe hare) and increased predation of an alternative prey species (porcupine). We show complex effects from climate change with some species directly and negatively affected, while others benefited from direct effects of warming winters, but suffered negative effects from indirect interactions. Due to absent snowshoe hares and associated biotic interactions, continued persistence of this community module is unlikely, potentially resulting in altered no‐analog communities along trailing edge distributions.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture, Hatch Projects 1006604 and 1003605.

Therefore, it is likely that small biological differences between species interact with habitat characteristics to produce distinct patterns of distribution and abundance throughout a new range. In this study we test the hypothesis that differences in the distribution and abundance of species sharing an identical set of ideal weed characteristics"" are explicable in terms of species—specific responses to environmental variation within their new range. Using multifactor experiments, we investigated some of the ecological interactions influencing reproductive success in two very closely related species of annuals having invaded the French Mediterranean region for >150 yr and showing marked differences in their local distribution and abundance patterns. We transplanted seedlings of Conyza canadensis (a species restricted to recently disturbed areas) and C. sumatrensis (a species colonizing early— to mid—successional old fields) at equal densities in three contrasting old fields (6 mo, 4 yr, 17—yr abandonment, respectively) during 1991—1992, a growing season with average rainfall. Individual performances (measured as survivorship, reproductive timing, and reproductive output) were evaluated with respect to: (1) competition with plant neighbors (tested with a weeding treatment), (2) resource availability (tested with nutrient and water addition), and (3) herbivory (tested with chemical limitation). Manipulated factors interacted in a rather complex fashion to influence survivorship and reproduction in both species. However, patterns of relative performance were consistent with relative distribution patterns across Mediterranean landscapes: C. sumatrensis performed better than C. canadensis in all fields, including the youngest one (6 mo old). Herbivory only slightly affected transplant performances. In contrast, competition with plant neighbors had substantial effects on either Conyza species and may be the most important determinant of performance in Mediterranean old fields. The experiment showed unambiguously that the two species differ markedly in their competitive ability, with C. sumatrensis performing better than C. canadensis in the presence of neighboring vegetation. In addition, C. sumatrensis displayed a superior ability to take up and/or to use water and nutrient resources when they become available in competitive environments. We argue that potential physiological or anatomical species differences responsible for this differential susceptibility to local resource reduction by neighbors could involve differences in constructional organization, leaf morphology, and reproductive phenologies.",,,Ecology,,Wiley,"0012-9658, 1939-9170",,1996-04-01,1996,1996-04-01,1996-04,77,3,791-804,Closed,Article,"Thebaud, Christophe; Finzi, Adrien C.; Affre, Laurence; Debussche, Max; Escarre, Josep","Thebaud, Christophe (); Finzi, Adrien C.

The choice of tree species in managed forests has strong broad effects on the community of insects and fungi that attack the trees, as well as on their predators, competitors, and mutualists. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain and predict community interactions involving non-indigenous plants. Two leading ideas are the Enemy Release Hypotheses (ERH) and the Biotic Resistance Hypothesis (BRH). Predictions of the Enemy Release Hypothesis that a plant species introduced to a new region should experience reduced impacts from herbivores and pathogens compared to within their native range have been frequently supported. However, some studies show higher herbivory on introduced plants when compared with similar native species, which supports prediction of the Biotic Resource Hypotheses. When the introduced plant species is closely related with some natives, the abundance and diversity of insect and pathogens can be higher in the introduced because they are recognized as food by the native herbivores but are less defended than the native plants due to the lack of coevolution. In this paper, we tested prediction of both hypotheses in the important forestry area of Galicia (NW of Spain) by assessing how the choice of native Pinus pinaster vs. non-indigenous Pinus radiata influences stand risks from the main pests in the area. We compared nutritional quality, tree defenses and the abundance and diversity of plant enemies and their associates in stands of native and non-indigenous pine species. Additionally we assessed whether silvicultural thinning helps to protect forest resources. Results suggest that the choice of where and what to plant when establishing plantation forests will influence subsequent damage by pests and diseases. In our study, stands of the non-indigenous P. radiata were more vulnerable to fungi, and more suitable for a notable defoliating insect, than stands of the native P. pinaster. Relative to the non-indigenous pine species, stands of P. pinaster tended to experience more attacks by more species of stem borers, but these attacks were dramatically less in thinned stands and could be subject to stronger controls by predators and parasitoids. Managing for sustainably high forest productivity requires considerations of forest health when choosing tree species and silvicultural practices.","The manuscript was improved by comments from Matt Ayres.

Yulong,"Seasonal timing (phenology) of reproduction is a critical dimension of life-history, affecting ecological and evolutionary processes including individual fitness, community interactions, species boundaries and climate change adaptation. Staggered phenological sequences, or progressions, of flowering in plants have long been a topic of interest. Less well studied are multi-dimensional progressions across seasonal time and elevational space, which may be especially vital to understanding montane and alpine environments that are among the ecosystems most vulnerable to climate change. To further our understanding of how phenological progressions are structured and to predict how they may respond to climate change, we collected data from an assemblage of ten co-occurring Himalayan Rhododendron species on Mt. Yulong, China, through two years of phenology monitoring in transects spanning a 1400 m elevation gradient, greenhouse experiments, and in comparison with the results of long-term models of species phenological responses to temperature derived from herbarium specimens. We asked whether we could quantitatively support flowering as a multi-dimensional progression in Mt. Yulong Rhododendron species, whether species that are part of this progression show differential phenological responses to changes in temperature, and how these responses impact reproductive success. We found evidence for a progression of flowering, with Rhododendron species significantly overdispersed in elevation and flowering time and showing significantly less inter-species overlap in flowering time-space niche (2.9%) than expected by chance (8.5%). As a whole, the progression responded to changes in weather (−2.4 days / °C) and to experimentally increased greenhouse temperatures (−9.3 days / °C). However, individual species responses varied in their response (from −26 – 2 days / °C). Models derived from historical herbarium specimens predicted contemporary observed flowering well (>95% of plants flowering within prediction intervals) and showed corresponding species differences. Reproductive output was affected by phenology, with the quantities of flowers and fruits greater in plants which flowered slightly earlier than their population mean (flowers p < 0.05; fruits p < 0.01), and in plants that responded to warmer weather with commensurately earlier flowering (flowers p < 0.01; fruits p < 0.001). The elaborately sequenced progression of flowering over season and elevation in Himalayan Rhododendron highlights the intricacy of species assemblages in time and space. Varying phenological responses among species and the associated reproductive impacts make this progression, like other staggered phenological sequences, vulnerable to disruption with ongoing climate change.","We thank the staff of the Jade Dragon Field Station and associated Lijiang Forest Ecosystem Research Station, and acknowledge gratefully the role of the Kunming Institute of Botany-Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh in establishing these facilities.

292,pub.1144866688,10.1111/1365-2435.14006,,,,Foliar herbivory on plants creates soil legacy effects that impact future insect herbivore growth via changes in plant community biomass allocation,"Plants leave legacy effects in the soil they grow in, which can drive important vegetation processes, including productivity, community dynamics and species turnover. Plants at the same time also face continuous pressure posed by insect herbivores. Given the intimate interactions between plants and herbivores in ecosystems, plant identity and herbivory are likely to interactively shape soil legacies. However, the mechanisms that drive such legacy effects on future generations of plants and associated herbivores are little known. In a greenhouse study, we exposed 10 common grasses and non‐leguminous forbs individually to insect herbivory by two closely related noctuid caterpillars, Mamestra brassicae and Trichoplusia ni (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) or kept them free of herbivores. We then used the soil legacies created by these plant individuals to grow a plant community composed of all 10 plant species in each soil and exposed these plant communities to M. brassicae. We measured conditioning plant biomass, soil respiration and chemistry of the conditioned soils, as well as individual plant, plant community and herbivore biomass responses. At the end of the conditioning phase, soils with herbivore legacies had higher soil respiration, but only significantly so for M. brassicae. Herbivore legacies had minimal impacts on community productivity. However, path models reveal that herbivore‐induced soil legacies affected responding herbivores through changes in plant community shoot: root ratios. Soil legacy effect patterns differed between functional groups. We found strong plant species and functional group‐specific effects on soil respiration parameters, which in turn led to plant community shifts in grass: forb biomass ratios. Soil legacies were negative for the growth of plants of the same functional group. Synthesis. We show that insect herbivory, plant species and their functional groups, all incur soil microbial responses that lead to subtle (herbivory) or strong (plants and their functional group) effects in response plant communities and associated polyphagous herbivores. Hence, even though typically ignored, our study emphasizes that legacies of previous insect herbivory in the soil can influence current soil–plant–insect community interactions.

Partner abundance may determine the relative costs and benefits associated with the interaction. Although arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can strongly influence plant phenotype and community interactions, the effects of AMF abundance on plant resistance traits and multitrophic interactions are not well understood. We tested the hypothesis that increasing AMF abundance in soil will increase mycorrhizal colonization and affect plant biomass, foliar phosphorus concentration, the expression of plant resistance and herbivore performance. We inoculated Asclepias syriaca seedlings with Glomus etunicatum, Scutellospora fulgida and a mix of the two species in 11 AMF abundance treatments. We quantified plant phosphorus (P), growth and resistance phenotype and the performance of a specialist herbivore, Danaus plexippus on plants associated with varying amounts of fungi. Increasing abundance of S. fulgida or G. etunicatum in soil increased the proportion of plant root colonized by AMF, but root colonization by a mix of the fungi was not related to inoculum density. The abundance of S. fulgida, but not G. etunicatum, increased per cent foliar P and trichome density, but decreased latex exudation. Abundance of all AMF treatments tended to decrease specific leaf mass (SLM), and the two single‐species treatments unimodally affected the expression of total foliar cardenolides. Increasing abundance of the mix of AMF species also increased above‐ground biomass, foliar P and trichome density, but had little effect on other traits. The presence of AMF, species identity and the AMF abundance all explained significant variation in the expression of plant traits, although their relative contribution varied depending on the trait examined. Mycorrhizal abundance strongly increased caterpillar growth rate, which was associated with a decline in SLM. Synthesis. Variation in mycorrhizal abundance can profoundly influence the expression of plant resistance and subsequent herbivore performance. AMF abundance may be a key, but overlooked factor in determining the outcome of mycorrhizal mutualisms. Our results demonstrate that the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi with which plants associate alters the expression of plant resistance, increasing specialist herbivore performance at high AMF abundance. AMF abundance, identity and presence all explained much variation in plant phenotype. We conclude that AMF abundance may be a key, but overlooked factor in determining the outcome of mycorrhizal mutualisms.","The authors would like to thank the Matthaei Botanical Gardens for greenhouse space and help with plant care, Mike Grant for analysing phosphorus samples and Hannah DeRose‐Wilson and Susan Kabat for help setting up and harvesting the experiment.

Tilefish are shelter seeking and inhabit three more or less distinct habitats: (1) horizontal excavations in clay outcrops along the walls of submarine canyons (pueblo habitats); (2) scour depressions under rocks and boulders and; (3) the primary habitat, funnel-shaped vertical burrows in horizontal clay substrates. There appear to be two critical habitat requirements, relatively warm (9–14±C) stable bottom temperatures and the availability of shelter or a malleable sustrate in which to construct a shelter. Suitable substrate for burrowing is usually provided by clay that is frequently exposed around submarine canyons. At least some vertical burrows were seen at most dive locations within the stud) area except at Norfolk Canyon. Pueblo and boulder habitats were mostly associated with submarine canyons off New England, and excavations under rock slabs were occupied in Baltimore Canyon. Vertical burrows occurred from 80–305m, but where vertical burrow and other habitats co-occurred, burrows were in shallower water (<120m). Vertical burrows were contagiously distributed, and significantly larger and more dense at the Mid-Atlantic dive sites than off New England (mean diameter and density = 1.6 m and 1234 per km2 at Hudson Canyon. 0.88 m and 624 per km2 at Veatch Canyon and 0.88m and 145 per km2 at Lydonia Canyon). Various crustaceans (e.g. Munida spp., Cancer sp., and goneplacid crabs) and fishes (e.g. Conger oceanicus, Anthias spp., Urophycis sp. and Helicolenus dactyhpterus) were more abundant in than awaj from burrows. Many species either live in or around the tilefish burrow so that the upper margin oi the burrow is honey-combed by their secondary burrowing. We believe burrows are formed by a combination of oral excavation by tilefish, secondary bioerosion by associated species, and tilefish swimming motions to flush fine sediment from the burrow. Tilefish appeared to orient to particular vertical burrows, and time lapse photography showed that fish may pair in burrows. Noncorresponding, temporal activity patterns of tilefish and associated species may indicate that predation by tilefish is a strong organizing principle in the community associated with tilefish burrows.",,,Environmental Biology of Fishes,,Springer Nature,"0378-1909, 1573-5133",,1986-04,1986,1996-04-01,1986-04,15,4,273-292,Closed,Article,"Grimes, Churchill B.; Able, Kenneth W.; Jones, Robert S.","Grimes, Churchill B.

282,pub.1011849761,10.1111/1365-2745.12736,,,,The tortoise and the hare: reducing resource availability shifts competitive balance between plant species,"Determining how changes in abiotic conditions influence community interactions is a fundamental challenge in ecology. Meeting this challenge is increasingly imperative in the Anthropocene where climate change and exotic species introductions alter abiotic context and biotic composition to reshuffle natural systems. We created plant assemblages consisting of monocultures or equal abundance of the native community dominant bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata) and the exotic spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe), a co‐occurring invasive forb that has overtaken grasslands across the western United States. We subjected these composition treatments to drought (20% of average precipitation vs. average) and herbivory on C. stoebe by its biocontrol agent Cyphocleonus achates to explore how reduced precipitation might influence the effects of competition and biocontrol herbivory on C. stoebe's abundance. At the end of 7 years, C. stoebe dominated mixed‐species plots under normal precipitation conditions, with biomass 50% greater than that of the native P. spicata. However, under drought stress, P. spicata's biomass was >200% greater than C. stoebe's. Interestingly, both species were impervious to drought in monoculture, indicating the importance of the drought by competition interaction. The biocontrol herbivore reduced C. stoebe abundance and indirectly increased P. spicata biomass in mixed‐species drought plots, but these effects were only marginally significant and relatively weak. Overall, C. stoebe abundance was primarily driven by the drought by competition interaction, with negatively additive but weak effects of the drought by herbivory interaction. The response of the exotic to the treatments was driven by rapid changes in population density linked to its fast life‐history strategy, while the native's response was driven by changes in per capita plant biomass linked to its slower life‐history strategy. Individual plant performance metrics did not predict overall population responses for the invader, indicating the importance of longer term population measures. Synthesis. These results demonstrate that reduced precipitation inputs linked to climate change can dramatically shift the balance of plant competition, even toggling the advantage from exotic to native dominance. They also illustrate the importance of biotic interactions in predicting species responses to abiotic change. The superinvader spotted knapweed loses to native dominant under drought. This study demonstrates that reduced precipitation inputs linked to climate change can dramatically shift the balance of plant competition, toggling the advantage from exotic to native dominance. Results also illustrate the importance of biotic interactions for predicting species responses to abiotic change, a finding with significant ramifications for assisted migration.","Acknowledgements We thank J.

Abstract Two hundred and forty seven species of dionychan spiders from the shrub and tree layers of six habitats in the region of Botucatu, State of São Paulo, Brazil, were studied, and their strategies for Coexistence were determined through construction of a community matrix. Spiders with relatively greater abundance behaved largely as generalists, independent of their environment, species represented by only a few individuals were numerous, and were considered to be marginal members of the communities. Estimates of the average community interaction coefficient for each species, and of covariation of the more abundant species in each ecosystem, indicate that the spiders avoid competition by spatial partioning, or by adopting differential strategies for habitat use, or because they belong to different guilds. In relation to the aggregate distribution of plants, species tend to specialization, and thus alter their strategy to follow the availability of resources in the environment. These results, together with accumulated knowledge of the ecology of spiders, lead to observations on the subgroup as agent of stabilization in insect populations.

In half of the study areas, percentage ground cover and total plant species cover were significantly lower in old diseased compared with adjoining healthy areas, with diseased front intermediate between the two. Evenness, Shannon-Weiner H and Simpson’s D did not significantly change between disease status for the majority of study areas. For ordination of percentage canopy closure and ground cover there was separation of study areas along a disease status gradient and a weak soil fertility gradient. There was significantly less percentage organic carbon, extractable phosphorus and extractable and total potassium in old diseased areas compared with adjoining healthy areas for one-quarter to a third of the study areas. Total phosphorus changed significantly between disease status, but this was due to higher levels in diseased front compared with the old diseased or adjoining healthy areas. For all study areas there was no significant effect of disease status on percentage total nitrogen and pH. The cover of a majority of plant species did not change significantly between disease status with 16% of the total number of perennial species in healthy areas significantly decreasing and 10% significantly increasing in cover in old diseased compared with adjoining healthy areas. As with significant differences in cover between disease status, change in cover of a majority of plant species was not significantly correlated with canopy closure. Cover of 20% of the total number of perennial species in healthy areas was significantly linearly positively correlated with canopy closure and the cover of 10% of plant species was significantly negatively correlated with canopy closure. These species were herbs and shrubs from a range of families with a mixture of functional properties such as Phytophthoria cinnamomi susceptibility, response to fire, rooting type and mycorrhizal association.

273,pub.1048443223,10.1017/s1742758400019779,,,,Sugar-cane weed community interactions with arthropods and pathogens,"Polyculture can help stabilize agroecosystems against frequent and severe pest outbreaks. An overview of the published data highlights ecological relationships among weeds, nematodes, arthropods, sugar-cane mosaic virus (SCMV), and the sugar-cane crop itself. Whereas individual studies commonly depict weeds as being either “good” or “bad”, this review is a synthesis of the variable roles and interactions of weeds in sugar-cane in order to provide a realistic perspective on the possibilities of weed interactions in sugar-cane agroecosystems. Conservation of weeds in Louisiana sugar-cane has resulted in more diversified arthropod fauna, higher natural enemy populations, and reduced damage by the sugar-cane borer, Diatraea saccharalis (F.). Weed competition and SCMV infection have each been associated with altered sugar-cane free amino acid accumulations that appeared to play a role in reducing populations of selected phytophagous nematodes. The combination of both weed and SCMV stress factors, however, have been shown to favour higher sugar-cane nematode populations. Although some weeds are alternate hosts for SCMV and its aphid vectors, and ratoon stunting disease (RSD), weed growth has not been linked with higher phytophagous nematode infestations or incidence of RSD. Weeds, if kept below economically competitive densities, may be ecologically and financially sound assets to sugar-cane pest management tactics. La polyculture aide à stabiliser les agroéchosystèmes contre les fréquentes et sévères épidémies d'insectes nuisibles. Une revue de la littérature met en lumière les relations écologiques entre les plantes herbacées, les nématodes, les arthropodes, le virus de la mosaique de la canne à sucre (SCMV), et la culture de la canne à sucre. Ce travail présente une synthèse des rôles et des interactions des plantes herbacées en agroéchosystème de canne à sucre. La présence de plantes herbacées dans les cultures de canne à sucre de Louisiane favorise une faune d'arthropodes diversifiée, des populations élevees d'ennemis naturels, et des dommages moindres par Diatraea saccharalis (F.). La compétition entre les plantes herbacées et les infections (SCMV) furent associées individuellement à l'accumulations d'acides aminés libres dans la canne à sucre ce qui réduirait les populations de certains nématodes phytophages. L'effet combiné du stress causé par les plantes herbacées et la SCMV favorise des populations élevées de nématodes de la canne à sucre. Quoique quelques plantes herbacées ont des hôtes alternatifs pour la SCMV et ses vecteurs aphidiens, et la maladie “ratoon stunting” (RSD), la croissance des plantes herbacées n'est pas liée aux infestations élevées de populations de nématodes ou à l'incidence de RSD.

273,pub.1148078610,10.1111/fwb.13919,,,,Unravelling another mystery: Parasite escape and host‐switching vary spatially in non‐indigenous populations of Japanese mystery snails,"Due to anthropogenic mechanisms, global freshwater biodiversity is declining, and non‐indigenous species are consistently cited as a major threat to native ecosystems. In particular, exotic freshwater gastropods and their parasites have invaded ecosystems through deliberate introductions and/or accidental transfer. In many cases, introduced hosts experience parasite escape in their non‐indigenous range by leaving behind some of their native parasite load during introduction. We investigated whether the Japanese mystery snail, Heterogen japonica, may be exhibiting signatures of parasite escape in non‐indigenous populations in the mid‐Atlantic U.S.A. by comparing the prevalence and diversity of trematode parasites in H. japonica and co‐occurring indigenous snails. Because trematodes can severely impact snail host reproduction, they are an important parasite group to investigate using comparative parasite analyses. Finally, we used genetic data to elucidate whether host switching of trematode lineages had occurred among the indigenous and non‐indigenous snails. Six locations from Richmond, Virginia to Washington, D.C. were surveyed for non‐indigenous and indigenous snails in 2018 and 2019. A random subset of each species was measured, dissected, sexed, and examined for parasite diversity. Brooding embryos were also counted in non‐indigenous snails. Among all snails, native species had a higher diversity of trematode (digenean and aspidogastrean) parasites than the invasive mystery snail, and infection was also influenced by site. Although H. japonica was uninfected at the majority of sites, it had moderate prevalence (up to 34%) of aspidogastrean trematodes at two sites. Female H. japonica infected with aspidogastreans had significantly fewer brooding embryos than uninfected snails. We found additional associates such as ciliates, nematodes, and the oligochaete Chaetogaster sp. in indigenous snails; of these, only ciliates and nematodes were found in association with H. japonica at comparatively low prevalence. While H. japonica has escaped several trematode species, specific populations still had high prevalence of aspidogastreans, the highest of which was found where H. japonica co‐occurred with the indigenous snail Elimia virginica. Genetic data found at least two cryptic lineages of aspidogastreans, and one was shared between H. japonica and E. virginica, suggesting that host‐switching has occurred. Parasites can play powerful roles in interspecific relationships, influence species interactions, and even impact ecosystem functioning. The ability of parasites to host switch could further influence community interactions in this system, particularly if H. japonica continues to spread in North America. Further research is needed to evaluate how parasites (or lack thereof) may mediate the interactions and demographics of indigenous and non‐indigenous species in invaded ranges.","We thank the Fowler lab for dissecting snails (Darby Pochtar, Alex Mott, Allison Assur, and Julia Czarnecki) and Dr Robert Dillon for snail identifications.

273,pub.1051036417,10.2307/2937321,,,,Ecological Abstraction: The Consequences of Reduced Dimensionality in Ecological Models,"Real world ecosystems (as opposed to their mathematical counterparts) are often enormously complex associations of species which interact in diverse ways. As a matter of practical necessity, field ecologists can rarely specify, much less quantify, all of the interactions. Consequently, empirically derived equations purporting to describe the dynamics of such systems generally consider fewer than the total number of interacting species. The present paper calls attention to this reduction in dimensionality and explores some of its consequences. In particular, attention is called to what are termed the Abstracted Growth Equations, those of reduced dimensionality, and to the way that these expressions derive from the underlying n—variable equations. The degree to which the Abstracted Equations accurately describe the dynamics of the species of interest is shown to depend on the time scale of these species relative to that of the species which are omitted. A general result relating the product of the eigenvalues of the Abstracted Equations to the corresponding product for the n—variable equations is proved. It is further pointed out that the distinction between Abstracted and n—variable equations suggests experiments which at least in principle should enable the empiricist to estimate the importance of species and interactions which are omitted. The relationship between Abstracted and n—variable equations is also discussed with regard to measuring competition coefficients and related parameters, and also to the problem of determining whether or not higher order interactions are present in laboratory microcosms. The analysis concludes by comparing the stability properties of several simplified models of community interactions with those of the corresponding one—species Abstracted Equations. It is shown, for the case of difference equations, in particular, that analysis of the one—species models may often lead one to conclude that the system is stable, whereas in fact it is unstable due to overdamping. The final Discussion relates the results of the present paper to previous studies that anticipate the view presented here, and comments on the quarrel that has developed between those ecologists who believe in the existence of community—wide patterns of body size and the like and those who reject this view. It is suggested that the resolution of this dispute may depend on our ability to classify subsystems of species (i.e., guilds) with regard to the extent to which their internal organization is influenced by variation in the larger communities in which they are embedded. Finally, it is shown that Roughgarden's principal results for community coevolution can be deduced from the Abstracted Growth Equations of a particular subset of the entire community.",,,Ecological Monographs,,Wiley,"0012-9615, 1557-7015",,1981-12,1981,,1981-12,51,4,383-401,Closed,Article,"Schaffer, William M.","Schaffer, William M.

Many studies have examined how variability in soil nutrients and topography influence plant community composition, with differing results. None have quantified the relative contribution of environmental heterogeneity versus endogenous processes to variability in forest community composition over time and with respect to successional recovery. Using five consecutive trees censuses of a forest plot in Puerto Rico, conducted between 1990 and 2011, we evaluated the influence of edaphic and topographic variability on community composition. The plot has a well‐documented land‐use history and is subject to periodic hurricane disturbance. Using multiple canonical distance‐based redundancy analyses, we studied how spatial heterogeneity in soil nutrients and topography structure community composition over time, as the forest recovers from long‐term land‐use effects and two major hurricanes in 1989 and 1998. For the entire plot, spatial variables (principle coordinates of neighbourhood matrices), representing the autocorrelation of tree species in the community, explained the majority (49–57%) of the variability in tree community composition. The explanatory power of spatial variables decreased over time, as forest structure recovered from hurricane damage and the stems in the understorey died. Soil nutrients and topography, collectively, explained a moderate portion (33–37%) of the species compositional variation and were slightly more robust in explaining compositional differences in areas of more intense past land use. Areas of less‐intense past land use showed weaker community–environmental trends overall, illustrating a tendency for stronger resource competition (i.e. light, water and soil nutrients) between species in these areas. This illustrates how environmental–plant community interactions are strengthened by the lasting effects of human land‐use legacies, which persist for decades to centuries. Synthesis. Our findings confirm past land use to be a fundamental driver of the structure and composition of secondary forests through its impacts on the tree community, the abiotic terrestrial environment and their interaction. Since the extent of second‐growth tropical forests continues to increase, our findings highlight the importance of understanding the processes that determine the rate and nature of their succession. Land use in the Luquillo Mountains of north‐eastern Puerto Rico (ca. 1800) primarily consisted of large charcoal operations. Large tabonuco (Dacryodes excelsa Vahl) trees were harvested and smoldered in large pits to provide cooking fuel for pre‐industrial Puerto Rican society. Large chunks of charcoal were collected and transported down the Luquillo Mountains to market using ox carts.","This research was funded by grants BSR‐8811902, DEB‐9411973, DEB‐9705814, DEB‐0080538, DEB‐0218039, DEB‐0516066 and DEB‐0620910 from the National Science Foundation to the International Institute for Tropical Forestry, USDA Forest Service, as part of the Luquillo Long‐Term Ecological Research Program.

The Purdue University undergraduate chapter of the American Society for Biochemistry (PU‐ASBMB) has designed a service‐learning outreach project that will further the ASBMB’s and Purdue’s goals of promoting equity and access to learning in the community, and engaging undergraduates in the social responsibilities of science communication. In the past, outreach efforts have achieved most positive feedback and engagement from schools that were already considered advantaged, or privileged. We hypothesize that because the COVID‐19 pandemic has exacerbated the preexisting racial and socioeconomic disparities present in underrepresented communities, there is an increased awareness of the knowledge‐ and opportunity‐gaps faced by many marginalized members of our communities, both by student‐members and by community stakeholders. Furthermore, we propose that this will create a need for more effective partnerships between Purdue University and the Greater Lafayette Community. Creating these partnerships is critical to addressing the disparities in access to science‐related educational opportunities. The objective of this service‐learning research project is to partner PU‐ASBMB with the Greater Lafayette community to foster greater engagement with marginalized populations of K‐8 students and their families. Based on our 2021 project proposal, the PU‐ASBMB has succeeded in partnering with the Hanna Community Center’s after‐school program which involves 26 K‐6th grade students from 7 schools in low‐income districts (www.hannacntr.org). The mission of the Center is “to provide quality services, programs and community interactions for the surrounding neighborhood and beyond” and to “celebrate traditions throughout the Greater Lafayette area while preserving the culture, heritage and history of African Americans and minority groups.” By integrating hands‐on experiences aligned with statewide learning outcomes, conducting interviews, classroom observations, and reflections of students and staff, our program will be evaluated to further address the needs of those underrepresented in the Lafayette community, such as those raised in low‐income families, as well as the Latinx, African American, and other marginalized populations. Drastically reframing the priorities of the PU‐ASBMB has allowed us to effectively engage with populations within our community with whom we can have a significant impact. Immediate feedback from stakeholders, both at Purdue and at the Hanna Center indicate significant support for this program. These findings support the execution of sustainable service initiatives to provide targeted support for diverse students in the local community. Future work will include pursuing these outreach opportunities, while also educating the Purdue community on the importance of recognizing their responsibilities in giving back to, and supporting the Greater Lafayette Community, without which Purdue would not be a world‐class higher institution for higher education.",,,The FASEB Journal,,Wiley,"0892-6638, 1530-6860",,2022-05-13,2022,2022-05-13,2022-05,36,S1,,Closed,Article,"Jiang, Rina; Tischendorf, Karlie; Hart, Orla M.","Jiang, Rina (Department of Biochemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN); Tischendorf, Karlie (Department of Biochemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN); Hart, Orla M.

Bark beetles face a particularly severe challenge because the phloem that they consume is very low in nitrogen and phosphorus relative to their requirements. We quantified variation in the phloem concentrations of N and P in the host tree, Pinus taeda, and evaluated the following hypotheses regarding the role of symbiotic fungi in nutrient budgets of the herbivore Dendroctonus frontalis: D. frontalis experience variation in phloem nutrient concentrations across several spatial scales (H1); mycangial fungi enhance the diet of D. frontalis larvae by contributing to the acquisition of N and P (H2); Ophiostoma minus, an apparently antagonistic fungal symbiont, hinders D. frontalis larvae because it does not enhance nutrient concentrations of the phloem as much as mycangial fungi do (H3); and larvae of bark beetle species that lack mycangial fungi must consume more phloem to accomplish the same growth as larvae of D. frontalis (H4). In addition, we developed a general model for the N budgets of herbivorous insects that identifies the possible combinations of dietary and physiological parameters that can allow developmental success on low‐nutrient diets. Spatial variation in phloem N was mostly at the level of trees within sites (a scale of meters) while P mostly varied among sites (a scale of kilometers). Trees with higher N content produced larger D. frontalis adults. Prior to infestation by beetles, phloem nutrient concentrations were very uniform within trees and very low relative to that of the bark beetles (N and P concentrations of D. frontalis adults were 28 and 8 times greater, respectively). During infestation, phloem nutrient concentrations increased overall and became highly variable within trees. Nitrogen concentrations increased from 0.40 ± 0.01% (mean ± 1 se) in uninfested phloem to 0.86 ± 0.03% in the phloem surrounding successfully developing D. frontalis larvae, which are typically associated with one or two species of mutualistic mycangial fungi. Nitrogen concentrations were intermediate in other microhabitats within infested trees, including regions with no adult colonization, with failed larval development, or colonized by the antagonistic bluestain fungus O. minus. We parameterized a general nutrient‐budget model for D. frontalis and a sympatric non‐mycangial bark beetle, Ips grandicollis, which indicated that (1) mycangial fungi provide their benefits by concentrating dietary N for larvae; (2) O. minus may exert its antagonistic effects on D. frontalis larvae by failing to concentrate dietary N as much as mycangial fungi do; (3) non‐mycangial bark beetles meet their N budgets through high consumption of unaltered, low‐N phloem; and (4) larvae should easily meet their P requirements with any combination of consumption rate and development time that allows them to meet their N requirements. Alternative strategies for N acquisition may have general consequences for the population dynamics and community interactions of bark beetles.","Bill Mattson generously assisted with the nitrogen and phosphorus analyses.

If diversity increases, and the number of ecological interactions also increases, weed species should be viewed as an interactive community, rather than an unrelated set of targets for control. In this review we summarize how diversity is evaluated in unmanaged Systems, examine how IWM techniques may alter the diversity of weed species and suggest how strategies can be developed for managing weed diversity under IWM. Methods used to evaluate diversity in natural Systems may be used to evaluate weed diversity in alternative Systems of weed management. We made preliminary calculations of diversity for reduced tillage, modified herbicide use, crop rotation, critical period of weed control, techniques to improve crop competitiveness, and alternative control methods. Many of these IWM techniques potentially may result in changes in weed species diversity. We examined potential effects of these changes in weed diversity within six primary elements of community ecology: colonization, disturbance, the physical environment, interactions with other communities, community interactions and community dynamics. Opportunities to develop strategies of community management exist within each of these elements. If diversity could be managed while maintaining acceptable crop yields, some previously unrealized benefits of the presence of weeds could be seen, as predicted by relationships among plants of unmanaged communities. Moreover, the goal of producing a more sustainable System that incorporates the diversity of the weed community would be complemented by trends in policy towards encouraging biodiversity in agroecosystems.
Les méthodes alternatives de gestion des mauvaises herbes, telles que la gestion intégrée, peuvent permettre la persistance de populations de mauvaises herbes sous un seuil économique déterminé. Une diversité accrue des espèces de mauvaises herbes peut aussi en résulter. Si la diversité ainsi que le nombre d'interactions écologiques augmentent, les espèces de mauvaises herbes devraient être considérées comme une communauté interactive plutôt que comme un ensemble disparate de cibles contre lesquelles lutter. Cet article de synthèse résume les méthodes d'évaluation de la diversité dans des systèmes non gérés, examine comment les techniques de gestion intégrée peuvent modifier la diversité des espèces de mauvaises herbes, et finalement, suggère des façons de développer des stratégies pour gérer la diversité des mauvaises herbes par la gestion intégrée de celles-ci. Les méthodes utilisées pour évaluer la diversité dans les systèmes naturels peuvent servir à évaluer la diversité des mauvaises herbes dans des systèmes alternatifs de gestion intégrée. Nous avons effectué des calculs préliminaires de diversité pour le labour réduit, l'utilisation modifiée des herbicides, les rotations culturales, la période critique d'intervention contre les mauvaises herbes, les techniques d'amélioration de la compétitivité des cultures et les méthodes de lutte alternatives. Plusieurs de ces techniques de gestion intégrée peuvent éventuellement résulter en des modifications de la diversité des espèces de mauvaises herbes. Nous avons examiné les effets potentiels de ces changements sur la diversité des mauvaises herbes à l'intérieur de six principaux éléments de l'écologie des communautés: la colonisation, la perturbation, l'environnement physique, les interactions inter- et intra-communautés, et la dynamique de ces communautés. Des occasions de développer des stratégies de gestion des communautés de mauvaises herbes existent à l'intérieur de chacun de ces éléments. Si la diversité pouvait être gérée tout en maintenant des rendements acceptables, certains bénéfices découlant de la présence des mauvaises herbes et non encore considérés pourraient être observés, tel que le prédisent les relations existant entre les plantes de communautés non gérées. De plus, l'objectif d'obtenir un système de production plus durable, tenant compte de la diversité des communautés de mauvaises herbes, pourrait être accompagné d'orientations vers une politique encourageant la biodiversité des agro-écosystèmes.",,,Phytoprotection,,Consortium Erudit,"0031-9511, 1710-1603",,2005-04-12,2005,2005-04-12,,75,1,1-18,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Clements, D.R.; Weise, S.F.; Swanton, C.J.","Clements, D.R.
